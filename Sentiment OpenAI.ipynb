Here is an analysis of the sentiment in the provided document:\\n\\n- In our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. (Polarity: -1, Subjectivity: 1)\\n- The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end. (Polarity: -1, Subjectivity: 1)\\n- What’s clear is the escalating human cost in terms of lost lives and lost jobs, with tens of millions of people now out of work. (Polarity: -1, Subjectivity: 0.8)\\n- At Netflix, we’re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term. (Polarity: 0.4, Subjectivity: 0.8)\\n- Like other home entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth. (Polarity: 0.3, Subjectivity: 0.6)\\n- We expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends, which we hope is soon. (Polarity: -0.3, Subjectivity: 0.6)\\n- By helping people connect with stories they love, we are able to provide comfort and escape as well as a sense of community during this pandemic. (Polarity: 0.7, Subjectivity: 0.9)\\n- Our product teams, for example, have been relatively unaffected. (Polarity: 0.3, Subjectivity: 0.4)\\n- We have seen significant disruption when it comes to customer support and content production. (Polarity: -0.3, Subjectivity: 0.4)\\n- In addition, we’ve taken on another 2,000 agents (all working remotely), so our customer service levels are almost fully restored despite the increased demand. (Polarity: 0.5, Subjectivity: 0.6)\\n- When it comes to production, almost all filming has now been stopped globally, with the exception of a few countries like Korea and Iceland. (Polarity: -0.5, Subjectivity: 0.5)\\n- This has been devastating for millions of workers in the TV and film industry. (Polarity: -0.5, Subjectivity: 1)\\n- In March, we created a $100 million fund to help with hardship in the industry. (Polarity: 0.6, Subjectivity: 0.6)\\n- These are all well-established hardship funds. (Polarity: 0.5, Subjectivity: 0.4)\\n- Netflix's revenue for Q1 was in line with guidance, despite higher-than-expected paid net additions. (Polarity: 0.4, Subjectivity: 0.6)\\n- Streaming average revenue per user (ARPU) grew 8% YoY, excluding a negative impact from foreign exchange. (Polarity: 0.3, Subjectivity: 0.4)\\n- The operating margin was 16.6%, lower than the forecasted 18.0%, primarily due to $218m in incremental content costs resulting from halted productions and hardship fund commitments. (Polarity: -0.4, Subjectivity: 0.8)\\n- The COVID-19 crisis has had three main effects on Netflix's financial performance: accelerated membership growth, lower international revenue due to a strong dollar, and delayed cash spending on content. (Polarity: 0.1, Subjectivity: 0.6)\\n- In terms of financial performance, Netflix experienced higher-than-forecast paid net additions but revenue remained in line with guidance due to the appreciation of the US dollar. (Polarity: 0.3, Subjectivity: 0.5)\\n- The crisis has impacted membership growth, international revenue, and production schedules, with delays and cash spending reductions expected. (Polarity: -0.5, Subjectivity: 0.7)\\n- In February, we rolled out our Top 10 most popular lists to nearly 100 countries after testing this feature last year in the UK and Mexico. (Polarity: 0.3, Subjectivity: 0.7)\\n- Updates include enhanced parental controls for our service to improve the experience for family members of all ages. (Polarity: 0.4, Subjectivity: 0.5)\\n- In Q1, net cash used in operating activities was +$260 million vs. -$380 million in the prior year period. (Polarity: -0.2, Subjectivity: 0.8)\\n- Free cash flow totaled +$162 million compared with -$460 million in the year ago quarter. (Polarity: 0.2, Subjectivity: 0.8)\\n- With our productions currently paused, this will shift out some cash spending on content to future years. (Polarity: -0.1, Subjectivity: 0.4)\\n- As a result, we’re now expecting 2020 FCF of -$1 billion or better. (Polarity: -0.1, Subjectivity: 0.4)\\n- We finished the quarter with cash of $5.2 billion, while our $750m unsecured credit facility remains undrawn.
