      "FINAL_Q3_15_Letter_to_Shareholders_With_Tables_\n",
      "We have grown to over 69 million members around the world and expect to end this year with over 74 million members. With a successful launch in Japan, and our launches next week in Spain, Italy and Portugal, we remain on track to become global by the end of 2016. Our summary results and forecast for Q4 are below. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Global membership grew 3.62 million to 69.17 million members compared to prior year growth of 3.02 million, and a forecast of 3.55 million. Operating income was $74 million, compared to prior year of $110 million and a forecast of $81 million. Seven quarters ago we moved to providing you our internal forecast for the quarter ahead. We strive for accuracy in this projection and, when it comes to global net additions, Q3 was our most accurate to date: we were within 2% (3.62 vs. 3.55) and within 10% on operating income ($74m vs. $81m). While global growth was as we expected, our forecast was high for the US and low for international. We added 0.88 million new US members in the quarter compared to 0.98 million prior year and a forecast of 1.15 million. Our over-forecast in the US for Q3 was due to slightly higher-than-expected involuntary churn (inability to collect), which we believe was driven in part by the ongoing transition to chip-based credit and debit cards. In terms of US net additions, through the first nine months of 2015, we are slightly ahead of prior year, and we expect to finish 2015 at about 2014 levels. This would mark the 4th consecutive year we’ve added about 6 million members in the US. Our US contribution margin in Q3 expanded 375 basis points year over year to 32.4%. This was inclusive of an acceleration in the amortization of some of our licensed content, similar to how we already treat originals and reflecting more viewing in the first month. The effect of this change was a $13 million decrease in US streaming contribution profit in Q3. For Q4, we anticipate 1.65 million US net adds and US contribution margin of 34.0% vs. 28.0% in the year ago quarter. We continue to target a 40% US contribution margin by 2020. International net add growth totaled 2.74 million compared to 2.04 million in the prior year and a 2.40 million forecast. Excluding the impact of foreign currency ($96 million on a year over year basis), international ASP improved 6% vs. Q3 ‘14, helped by plan mix. In August, we raised our high-definition 2-screen monthly price plan in Europe by one Euro without negatively impacting growth. As we have indicated previously, international contribution losses will grow sequentially in Q4 as we launch Spain, Italy and Portugal. We have announced our expansion to South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore in early 2016. Our plan remains to run around break-even through 2016 and to deliver material profits thereafter. Last week we increased prices in several countries including the US, to improve our ability to acquire and offer high quality content, which is the number one member request. Our US pricing is now $7.99 for our standard-definition 1-screen-at-a-time plan (unchanged), $9.99 for our high-definition 2-screen plan (up $1), and $11.99 for ultra-high-definition 4-screen plan (unchanged). Members who were paying $8.99 for the high-definition plan are grandfathered at that price for one year. 2Content As our membership expands, we are quickly becoming a global distribution platform for creators worldwide. Narcos, our latest original series, is a hit and is another fine example of a Netflix original - ​ ​ embraced by both critics and audiences and global in nature (bilingual, Brazilian director and star, US ​ ​ ​ ​ and Latin American cast, shot in Colombia) with substantial viewing across all our territories. This past quarter, we also unveiled our first locally-produced original series, Club de Cuervos, which ​ ​ played strongly not just in its home country of Mexico but with Spanish speakers around the world, including the US. We are currently in production on our second Mexican original series, Ingobernable, ​ ​ starring Latin American TV superstar, Kate del Castillo, and the French produced Marseille. We have ​ ​ also announced original series productions in Brazil and Italy. ​ ​ We will launch our first original feature film Beasts of No Nation on Netflix on October 16. This gripping ​ ​ war drama featuring Idris Elba and Abraham Attah has received universal critical acclaim and is an early ​ ​ Oscar hopeful. Attah won the prestigious Marcello Mastroianni Award at the Venice Film Festival ​ ​ ​ recognizing him as the best newcomer. We’re also excited to release the first of four films from Adam Sandler, The Ridiculous Six, in December. This release comes on the heels of Sandler’s global success ​ ​​ ​ with Pixels ($240M worldwide box office) and the currently hot Hotel Transylvania 2 (already grossing ​ ​ ​ ​ over $200M worldwide box office and yet to be released in many of the larger foreign markets). ​ Just three years into our originals strategy, we have come a long way and our content is increasingly recognized for its quality and breadth. This year, we garnered a Netflix-record 34 Emmy nominations, across 11 of our original series and documentaries and won four. Netflix and HBO were the only networks to have 3 shows competing for best series honors this year. HBO had an amazing year at the Emmys, but we have only just begun. In addition, Common Sense Media recently named 6 of our original series among the 25 best shows on TV for families with kids from age 2-17. ​ ​ It is clear that Internet TV is becoming increasingly mainstream and traditional media companies are adjusting to the shift from linear to on-demand viewing. It is a great time to be a creator of content because studios make content to sell content (not to withhold it) and there are new bidders for their product. Some studios will choose to license content to SVOD services like Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix. Others may not. We have a lot of content to select from. We recently announced that we have acquired global second window rights to four major series. These are How to Get Away with Murder, ABC’s highest rated new series from the 2014/2015 TV season, the ​ ​ eagerly anticipated Colony from Legendary Television and Universal Cable Productions and, from CBS, ​ ​ Zoo, the most-watched scripted summer series of 2015 and the critically acclaimed, Emmy nominated ​ and Golden Globe winning Jane the Virgin. These deals will ensure that audiences around the world will ​ ​ have access to these exciting series on Netflix. 3Last month, we did not renew our deal to carry movies from EPIX, as the films were non-exclusive, US-only and offered in windows even further behind other premium Pay TV outlets. So far, we’ve seen no material reduction in US feature film viewing as we have so many other films for members to enjoy. We are investing in high profile, exclusive and globally available original films and creating the first-of-their-kind global Pay TV deals directly with producers. In some cases, we are making the films available globally after a 30 day theatrical and VOD window or in the case of the upcoming New Regency film The Big Short, with Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell, we will offer the film ​ ​ globally in a more traditional Pay TV window several months after theatrical and transactional VOD, in all territories excluding France. Product In September, we expanded our in-app purchase relationship with Apple by extending our partnership from Apple TV to iPhone and iPad. Now, new members around the world can sign up for Netflix in-app on the iPhone and iPad, creating a more seamless user experience. We recently announced a partnership with Virgin America, where new and existing members are able to stream the full Netflix service to their personal devices (at no additional cost) at 35,000 feet in the sky on newly upgraded Virgin America aircraft. Partnerships like this advance our goal to bring Netflix streaming to members wherever they are and whenever they want. Competition The competitive landscape remains vibrant as Netflix competes with many forms of entertainment for consumers’ leisure time. Other SVOD services continue to evolve: Hulu now offers a commercial free option at $11.99 per month, HBO GO is expanding into Latin America, and the press reported that Amazon Prime spent about $250 million on the new Jeremy Clarkson show. They remain active bidders for content, in addition to all the cable networks around the world. As we have written in our Long-Term View, linear networks that embrace on demand and Internet ​ ​ delivery as we have, will become more valuable and will experience renewed growth (like HBO Now), while those that do not will lose relevancy. The secular shift to on-demand consumption is best described as “consumers evolving vs. old habits” rather than “Netflix vs. traditional media.” We’re all racing to fulfill consumer desires. DVD Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve and please over 5 million members, providing us with $80 million in contribution profit in Q3 (down 11% Y/Y). The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and TV shows, remains attractive to a core member base and means that the tail on this business should be quite long. 4Free Cash Flow and Capital Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$252 million, down from -$229 million in Q2, due to the working capital intensity of our investment in originals, which results in higher cash spent upfront relative to content amortization. Investing in originals remains the right strategy for Netflix. Exclusive first-window “only on Netflix” content differentiates our service, allows us to leverage our global platform, reduces our dependence on third parties, and adds positive brand halo. Moreover, as more of our content spend is devoted to producing and owning our originals, we are building long term library value. At the end of Q3, gross debt totaled $2.4 billion, which represents a debt to total cap ratio of about 5%, and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash & equivalents and short term investments. We are likely to raise additional capital next year to fund our continued content investments.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 540-3700      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures  This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the r​elease of tax reserves​, and to free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However,  these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion, content launches, including  timing of feature film availability; business outlook for our DVD segment; raising capital; member growth  domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  6  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2015.  The Company  provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from  these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or  circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.  7                                                                                                                                                          8 Netflix, Inc.

      "FINAL_Q3_Letter\n",
      "Fellow shareholders,    In Q3, quarterly global streaming revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time (up 36% year over year),  helped by our strong content slate including ​Stranger Things​ and the second season of ​Narcos​. On a  constant currency basis, this represents 39% year-over-year revenue growth, a 400 basis point  acceleration from the last two quarters. Our summary results and forecast are below:             1  Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Global streaming revenue totaled $2.2 billion, of which 40% was generated abroad. Operating income  amounted to $106 million (compared with our $64 million estimate) while net income was $52 million  (vs. forecast of $22 million).   In Q3, we added 0.4 million members in the US vs. our forecast of 0.3 million and 3.2 million members  internationally vs. our forecast of 2.0 million.  Our over-performance against forecast (86.7m total  streaming members vs. forecast of 85.5m) was driven primarily by stronger than expected acquisition  due to excitement around Netflix original content.   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report  and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, we under forecasted member growth, while in Q2, it was the opposite.  For the first nine months of 2016, we’ve added 12 million global members, the same as in the first nine  months of 2015.  By the end of Q3’16, we had un-grandfathered 75% of the members that are being un-grandfathered  this year and the impact has been consistent with our expectations. ASP grew over 10% year-over-year  in both the US and international segments (excluding a $35 million F/X impact). With more revenue, we  can reinvest to further improve Netflix to attract new members from around the world, while continuing  to delight our existing customers.   Domestically, revenue rose 23% year over year, 480 basis points faster than Q2. US marketing expense  rose as a percentage of revenue as we spent to build awareness for our expanding number of original  titles. US contribution profit increased 38% year-over-year with contribution margin expanding to 36%,  slightly ahead of our 35% forecast.  In the international segment, we exceeded our internal projection for net adds as the acquisition impact  of our originals was greater than anticipated across many of our markets. F/X-neutral revenue rose 72%  and international contribution loss was flat sequentially at $69 million as content costs came in under  our forecast due partly to timing. We are investing in more content across multiple international  markets in Q4 and, as a result, we project international contribution loss to grow moderately to $75  million.   In September, we localized Netflix in Poland and Turkey. We began accepting payment in local currency  and added a local language user interface, subtitles and dubbing as well as some local content. We have  seen nice gains in viewing and retention and we’ll undertake other localization efforts in the coming  months and years.   For Q4, we forecast 5.2 million global net adds, with 1.45 million net adds in the US and 3.75 million new  members internationally. Our expectation for a moderate year-over-year decline in net adds reflects the  completion of un-grandfathering. We are pleased with the results thus far as we expect ASP to grow  12% from Q1’16 to Q4’16. Internationally, the initial demand from our launch in Spain, Portugal and Italy  in Q4’15 will also affect our year-over-year net adds comparison.   2  We will face a tough international net adds comparison in Q1’17 because of the initial membership  surge in Q1’16 tied to the launch of 130 additional territories.  As discussed, for the balance of 2016, we will continue to operate around break even, and then start  generating material global profits in 2017 and beyond, by marching up operating margins steadily for  many years.  Content  We kicked off Q3 with the release of ​Stranger Things​ on July 15 to both critical and audience ​acclaim​.  This nostalgic, supernatural thriller proved to be the ​blockbuster of the summer​ and is the kind of broad  appeal, cross demographic, and cross border sensation that we hope will distinguish Netflix original  content. ​Stranger Things​ is also notable as it is produced and owned by Netflix, which provides us with  more attractive economics and greater business and creative control. In August, we launched ​The Get  Down​, a highly stylized drama set in 1970s New York City, detailing the origins of hip-hop. We look  forward to releasing part two of season one next year.   Our hit series ​Narcos​ returned for season two in September to great success among critics and  audiences ​alike​. ​Narcos ​had a positive impact on member acquisition across all of our markets,  demonstrating the ability for our tentpole franchises to connect with audiences across the world. We  closed the quarter with ​Marvel’s Luke Cage​, the latest installment in our Marvel series, which will  continue with ​Iron Fist​ on March 17, 2017. We are also looking forward next year to ​The Defenders​, a  team-up of the characters from our first four Marvel series.   We are now in the fourth year of our original content strategy and are pleased with our progress. In  2017, we intend to release over 1,000 hours of premium original programming, up from over 600 hours  this year. The Internet allows us to reach audiences all over the world and, with a growing base of over  86 million members, there’s a large appetite for entertainment and a diversity of tastes to satisfy.   We are fortunate that our Internet-centric, on-demand, subscription-only business model allows us to  support programs for both mass and niche audiences alike. Our personalization algorithms help us  promote the right content to the right viewers. And since we are not shelf-space constrained nor reliant  on advertising, we have the luxury to tell all kinds of stories in less traditional ways. The growth of  Internet TV globally has ushered in a new golden age of content, with consumers everywhere enjoying  unprecedented access to amazing amounts of high quality programming.   With an expanding content budget (approximately $6 billion in 2017 on a P&L basis), we judge the  success of our portfolio of originals in several ways. For each series or film, we measure the impact on  acquisition and member engagement which, in turn, is correlated with retention. To determine relative  performance, we look at each title’s share of viewing compared with its share of our content budget. We  also take into account qualitative factors such as earned media coverage and awards, which enhance  our brand and our ability to attract talent for future projects. This year, we are thrilled to have won nine  Emmys (out of 54 nominations) across six different shows.   3  This past quarter, we announced a global pact with 20th Century Fox Studios to license ​The People vs.  O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story ​and ​Queen of the South​ and an agreement with The Walt Disney Co.  to license ​Quantico​ and ​American Crime​ in the US and Canada. We are also increasingly ensuring early  financing and sharing windows globally with original broadcasters for series like ​Star Trek: Discovery  from CBS, ​The Alienist ​from Paramount TV and the just-launched  ABC series ​Designated Survivor​ from  eOne.  Product and Partnerships  We continue to make progress with our MVPD partnerships. We are excited that the Netflix app will be  available across ​Liberty Global’s footprint​ beginning in the Netherlands later this year and expanding to  other countries in 2017. Partnerships like this and our integration on X1 with ​Comcast​ validate the  strength of our content and that we are additive to the current offerings of MVPDs. By working  together, MVPDs can sell richer Internet and TV packages, while consumers can more easily sign up for  and access Netflix, thus allowing Netflix and our partners to better serve our shared customers.  China  The regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging. We  now plan to license content to existing online service providers in China rather than operate our own  service in China in the near term. We expect revenue from this licensing will be modest. We still have a  long term desire to serve the Chinese people directly, and hope to launch our service in China  eventually.   Competition  We face immense competition for consumer screen time. Despite video gaming getting better, video  messaging and sharing improving, MVPD UI enhancements, YouTube growth, more SVOD services, and  other screen time competitors, Netflix continues to win both time and affection. We presume that  Amazon Prime Video will become as global as YouTube and Netflix this fall with the launch of the Jeremy  Clarkson show.  Our challenge is to continue to improve our service and content so that we better meet  consumer desires. Total screen time is quite large and growing as technology and content improve  globally.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q3, free cash flow was -$506 million vs. -$254 million in Q2’16 and -$252 million in the year ago  quarter. The increase in our free cash flow deficit reflects the growth of original content, which we are  increasingly producing and owning (rather than licensing). Self-produced shows like ​Stranger Things  require more cash upfront as we incur spending during the creation of each show prior to its completion  and release. In comparison, we generally pay on delivery for licensed originals like ​Orange is the New  Black​ and we pay over the term of the agreement for licensed non-originals (eg, ​Scandal​).    4  Over the long run, we believe self-producing is less expensive (including cost of capital) than licensing a  series or film, as we work directly with the creative community and eliminate additional overhead and  fees. In addition, we own the underlying intellectual property, providing us with global rights and more  business and creative control. Combined with the success of our portfolio of originals and the positive  impact on our member and revenue growth, we believe this is a wise investment that creates long term  value. Consequently, we plan on investing more, which will continue to weigh on free cash flow. We  expect Q4’16 FCF to be similar to Q3’16 FCF. Over time, we will be able to fund more of our investment  in programming through the growth in operating profit and margin already underway.  Streaming content obligations at quarter end were $14.4 billion, up $1 billion sequentially. The increase  reflects the addition of both new original and non-original content to our library as well as expanded  rights for our new territories.   We finished the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents. As we have often done over the past  few years, we plan to raise additional debt in the coming weeks. With a debt to total capitalization ratio  of about 5%, we remain underleveraged compared both to similar firms and to our view of an efficient  capital structure. Our 2025 bonds continue to ​trade well​.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: ​July 2016​, ​April 2016​, ​January, 2016​,  October 2015​, ​July 2015​, ​April 2015​, ​January 2015​, ​October 2014​.      Conclusion   We have many fantastic titles to enjoy. For investors, though, we’d like to call out the ​The Crown​.  If you  appreciated ​Mad Men​, ​House of Cards​ and ​Downton Abbey, ​we think you will find ​The Crown  extraordinary. It debuts November 4, three Fridays from now.

Management believes that the non​-GAAP measure  of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves provides useful information as  this measure excludes effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes  that the non-GAAP financial measures of revenue and ASP growth on a constant currency basis are  useful in assessing underlying business performance excluding the effect of foreign currency rate  fluctuations.  Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics  because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay  debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-​GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, revenue,  operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other  financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these  non​-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.  Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding content investments; localization efforts; ASP;  profitability in 2017 and beyond; content releases and programming hours; our content budget; MVPD  partnerships; business plans for China; future capital raises and timing of such raises; domestic and  international net additions, and total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income and margin, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The  forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain  existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for  streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions  of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of  viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company  provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from  these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or  circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.  6      7 Netflix, Inc.

      "Netflix added nearly 3 million streaming members in Q1, bringing our total to over 26 million global streaming members, and strengthening our position as the world’s leading Internet TV network. We anticipate returning to global profitability in Q2, and plan to launch our next international market in Q4. We are constantly improving our service with better personalization, better user-interfaces, better streaming, and more content. As a result, per-member viewing hours set new records in Q1 and are on track to do so again in Q2, on a year-over-year basis. We launched our service in the UK and Ireland in January and are very pleased that, after the first 90 days, we had substantially more members than we had after the first 90 days of Canada or Latin America. 1    2  Domestic Streaming  Q1 Results  Domestically, we achieved strong quarter-over-quarter growth in streaming members, adding 1.7  million total net additions (and 1.9 million paid net additions) in the quarter, and reaching 23.4 million  total streaming members.    New content additions, steady improvement to the Netflix user-interfaces and personalization  algorithms, and the receding impact of last year’s brand hit, all continue to contribute to incremental  improvements in our domestic streaming business and the resulting member growth.    The domestic streaming segment delivered $67 million of contribution profit, equivalent to a 13%  contribution margin. We exceeded our domestic streaming contribution margin target of around 11%,  due to slightly lower than expected content, delivery, and customer service expenses.  Outlook – Increased Seasonality in Net Adds  We anticipate that U.S. streaming contribution margin will expand in Q2 to about 15%.   For Q3 onward,  we are targeting 100 bps of average margin expansion per quarter, consistent with our January  guidance.   We think our 2012 domestic streaming net adds will be about the same as in 2010 (about 7 million), and  that gross adds will approximately follow the 2010 seasonal pattern.    At the same time, we have more net add quarterly seasonality this year due to our larger starting  membership base for the same amount of annual net adds.  In other words, given the same gross add  quarterly distribution as in 2010, and the same annual net adds, it is inherent that the quarterly  variation in net adds is amplified.  We have included an appendix at the end of this letter to illustrate  this.    Due to this increased net add quarterly seasonality, Q2 net adds will be below those of 2010, despite Q2  gross adds following the traditional seasonal pattern, and despite us expecting to match 2010 in annual  net additions.    We see nothing new or particularly concerning this quarter to date in our member viewing, acquisition  and retention.  All are healthy.     Domestic Content Library  As a result of the significant investments in our streaming library over the last 18 months, we have  meaningfully increased the quantity and quality of the TV shows and movies on the service. Going  forward, we continue to sign new agreements to bolster our content offering, while also benefiting from  our established relationships with all major producers of film and TV in the U.S. that continue to ensure  a steady flow of new titles to the service. As we stated in our January letter, we are growing content      3  spend sequentially every quarter, but slower than domestic streaming revenue growth to allow for  margin expansion.   Feature Films  In Q1, we added several notable new release Pay TV 1 feature film titles to the service, including  Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature, “Rango”, “The Lincoln Lawyer”, and “Justin Bieber:  Never Say Never”.  Meanwhile, our studio partners continue to provide additional high quality catalog  product.    We recently announced a new multi-year licensing agreement with The Weinstein Company that will  make foreign language, documentary and certain other movies exclusively available for Netflix members  in the U.S.  As a result, this year’s Academy Award winner for Best Picture “The Artist” and Best  Documentary “Undefeated” will be shown in their Pay TV 1 window exclusively on Netflix.   Looking forward to Q2, the volume of exclusive titles we receive through agreements with several mini- major distributors will steadily increase.  Notably, the action-thriller “Killer Elite” distributed by Open  Road Films will come to Netflix along with several films from Film District including Golden Globe  nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, “In the Land of Blood and Honey”, critically acclaimed action- drama, “Drive”, and “The Rum Diary” starring Johnny Depp.  Meanwhile, titles arriving from Epix are  getting even better with “Thor” and “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”, also coming this quarter.  The Starz deal for 15 Disney Pay TV 1 output titles, plus some catalog films, ended in February.  There  was no discernible change in churn or viewing levels.   Instead, the trend towards watching episodic TV,  like “Breaking Bad”, on Netflix continues to grow.  On a year-over-year basis, our content is stronger  than it has ever been, and our viewing per member is at a record high level.     TV Content  Our selection of TV content also got stronger in Q1, as we added  shows like “Supernatural” and “90210”  from the CW, “Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior” and the Showtime series “United States of Tara” from  CBS, AMC’s “The Killing” and A&E’s “Breakout Kings” from Fox, “Being Human (U.S.)” from Muse  Entertainment, and Comedy Central’s “Workaholics” from Viacom Media Networks. Meanwhile, we  continue to add new seasons of existing series every quarter. In addition, we recently announced our  first deal with Hasbro, providing Netflix with a wide variety of new kids content including “My Little  Pony” and “Transformers: Prime”.      In the past, we have said that our licensing of complete back seasons of on-air TV series is not only a  great experience for Netflix members, but can help build the audience for new seasons. We saw this  demonstrated recently with the premiere of Season 5 of “Mad Men” on AMC achieving its biggest  audience yet (20% higher than last season’s premiere), subsequent to the first four seasons becoming  available on Netflix last summer.  Even now, the most watched episode of “Mad Men” on any given day  on Netflix is the first episode of the first season. This means we are still growing the fan base for this  show nearly 6 years after it first premiered on television.      4  Domestic Streaming Competition  We compete for consumers’ viewing time with a very wide range of video sources, including linear TV  (MVPD and free-to-air), DVR, over-the-top (OTT) pure plays such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant  Video, and authenticated streaming offerings of the MVPDs and cable networks (TV Everywhere).   Hulu launched its first original series, and has continued its platform (Wii) and country (Japan)  expansion.   While we have ten times more domestic paid members, and we added over three times  more domestic net additions than Hulu in Q1, we do watch them carefully.   Most of their viewing, we  believe, is from current-season broadcast-network content.    Amazon continues to grow its U.S. video content library available through Amazon Prime.  We think they  are still substantially behind Hulu in viewing hours.  Given Amazon’s size and ambitions, we continue to  track their progress carefully as well.    As we’ve often said, we see the biggest long-term competition for viewing hours from MVPDs and cable  networks through their TV Everywhere offerings. Consistent with this view, we began to see the  consumer promise of TV Everywhere emerge in Q1, with all major networks and many MVPDs investing  in their Internet applications and taking steps to evolve to Internet TV networks. Among recent  developments, both HBO GO as well as Comcast’s Xfinity application became available on the Xbox.   Additionally, Comcast announced its Streampix streaming service available to current Comcast  subscribers. Given the superiority of our content selection, user interfaces and device ubiquity, we don’t  currently see any meaningful near-term impact on our business from these developments.   Internet Caps Should Apply Equally, or Not At All.   Comcast caps its residential broadband customers at 250 gigabytes per month.   On the Xbox, the Netflix  app, the Hulu app, and the HBO GO app, are all subject to this cap.  But Comcast has decided that its  own Xfinity Xbox app is not subject to this 250 gigabyte cap.   This is not neutral in any sense.   The Xbox  is a pure Internet device with a single IP address, works over a consumer’s home wifi, and data to the  Xbox is Internet data.  When the Xfinity Xbox app uses lots of bandwidth, it competes for that  bandwidth with all other Internet usage and users in the home.  The Xfinity Xbox app “speaks” TCP/IP  like any other Internet device. The only difference between the Xfinity Xbox data and Netflix Xbox data  is the Xfinity data is favored by Comcast exempting it from the cap.    Comcast could raise the cap and make it apply equally or just eliminate the caps.   Net neutrality  principles mean a level playing field for all Internet applications.    International Streaming  We surpassed 3 million total international streaming members this quarter, growing 65% sequentially,  and adding 1.2 million total net additions (and nearly 1 million paid net additions).  Just six quarters after  our first international market launch, our non-U.S. members account for nearly 12% of total (and 10% of  paid) Netflix streaming members.      5  UK and Ireland  The largest driver of growth in international members in Q1 was the launch of our service in the UK and  Ireland at the beginning of January. From the start, we achieved the highest net additions we’ve ever  seen in the first 90 days of an international market launch.   While the UK is a very competitive market, we have found that the existence of competition can be  beneficial for driving interest and demand in our service.  The existence of other over-the-top (OTT)  streaming and on-demand services creates a high level of product understanding and acceptance among  consumers and that, in turn, increases their willingness to try Netflix.  In January, we launched with an impressive and diverse base of movies and TV shows, and as our  membership continues to grow, we’ll be able to add further to the content library.  Lately, we’ve offered  members new movies from our existing deals, including Pay TV 1 and 2 titles like “Insidious”, “Horrid  Henry: The Movie”, and “Angels & Demons”, as well as iconic catalog titles, such as, “Pulp Fiction”, “The  Godfather”, and “Top Gun”.  In the coming months, Netflix will be the Pay TV 1 UK home of “21 Jump Street” and “The Hobbit” from  MGM, “The Woman in Black” from Momentum and the recent monster hit “Hunger Games” from  Lionsgate. Collectively, our upcoming offerings account for 20% of UK box office year to date, compared  to our competitor LOVEFiLM, whose deals we estimate account for around 6%.  Our TV offering is also strong, with previous seasons of current shows from the major U.S. networks and  three key local channels. We are particularly excited to be the UK and Ireland TV premiere destination  for shows like, “Breaking Bad” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”.  From our experience to date, we continue to believe our biggest competitors will be Sky Movies and Sky  Atlantic (and potentially Sky’s yet-to-be-launched Now TV streaming service), as well as LOVEFiLM.   Without details on consumer pricing or content selection, it remains unclear whether Sky’s Now TV will  be a meaningful competitor. Ultimately, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in the UK and  Ireland based on our content selection as well as our superior streaming technology.   If the UK Competition Commission eventually forces Sky Movies to not control the Pay TV 1 output from  all six major studios, that then may provide an opportunity for Netflix to bid earlier for major studio  deals than otherwise would have been the case.  It is premature to know how it will play out.   In the UK and Ireland we launched with our most broad-scale Facebook integration to date, and are  pleased with the level of consumer engagement.   Social TV show and movie discovery is heavily used by  our Facebook connected members.    Canada  Canada continues to be a strong market for Netflix.  Member growth remained healthy in Q1, and we  ended the quarter with nearly double the members we had a year ago.      6  Our on-going investment in new content for Canada is driving increased engagement and hours viewed.  Just this month, through our Pay TV 1 deals we’ve added such blockbusters as, “Thor”, and  “Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon”, with “Kung-Fu Panda II” and “Captain America” coming soon.  We are also licensing for our members some great Canadian content, including “Dragon’s Den”, “Arctic  Air”, and “Mr. D,” three of the top rated shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC).  Even with our continued content investment, we anticipate a small contribution profit in Canada in Q2  and will remain profitable in this market going forward. This is a quarter earlier than our January  expectations for Canadian profitability, made possible by the continued strength of member growth and  increased efficiency of our marketing spend. Long-term, we intend to steadily increase our contribution  margin in much the same way as we are doing for our U.S. streaming business.   Latin America  As mentioned in our January investor letter, Latin America differs significantly from our other markets.  While there is limited current OTT streaming competition in the region (different from the UK), this lack  of OTT competition means that the concept of on-demand streaming video (outside of piracy and  YouTube) is nascent, requiring us to do more work in driving consumer understanding and acceptance of  our streaming service.  In addition, Latin America presents unique infrastructure challenges relative to  our other markets; namely, low device penetration, under-developed Internet infrastructure and  relatively low credit card usage as well as general consumer payment challenges for ecommerce.  For  example, many banks turn down all ecommerce debit card transactions due to fraud risk, making it a  more challenging environment than our other markets.  To offset these challenges and improve the consumer experience, we have been continually expanding  the content offering. In Q1, we added new series to our TV offerings including, “Dexter”, “Ancient  Aliens” and “Charmed”, as well a host of popular feature films including, “Twilight: New Moon”,  “Gnomeo & Juliet”, “The Incredibles”, “Insidious”,  “Couples Retreat”, and “Saving Private Perez” (the  top Mexican film of 2011). For Q2, we are beginning to ramp up the number of Pay TV 1 titles on our  service, including Best Picture winner “The Artist” in June; and “Something Borrowed”, and “From Prada  to Nada”, during the quarter.     In Q1, we increased our subtitle coverage to nearly 100% of non-kids English language content (in  addition to previously available dubbing) to accommodate varying viewing preferences. Finally, we’re  very focused on optimizing our payment processing to continue to improve free trial conversions to paid  members, as well as exploring adding new payment methods to expand the addressable market of  consumers.  Our revenue and membership is growing in Latin America, and we are rapidly learning.   The odds of us  building a large, profitable business in Latin America are very good, but it will take longer than we  initially thought.         7  Total International Results & Outlook    In Q1, international revenue of $43 million was up more than 3X from a year ago, and in-line with  expectations. Contribution loss of $103 million was better than anticipated due to slightly higher  revenue combined with lower than expected content, subtitling and marketing expenses.  In connection  with our Latin American market, we incurred increased subtitling costs in Q1 which have been  capitalized into the content library ($5 million, net of amortization).  Last year, such costs were  immaterial and expensed as incurred.  We expect subtitling costs to continue to be meaningful as we  launch additional non-English markets in the future.  So, our forecast incorrectly assumed $5 million in  expense.    In Q2, we expect Canada to deliver a small profit, and the growth of members and revenue in Latin  America and the UK and Ireland to lower the contribution loss in each of those markets. In total,  international contribution loss is expected to sequentially improve to a range of between ($98) and  ($86) million.   Our early success in Canada – sustainably profitable less than 2 years after launch – is probably unusual  given the proximity of Canada to the U.S. and the broad pre-launch awareness of our brand.  As a result,  we expect Latin America and the UK and Ireland to take longer than 8 quarters to reach sustained profits  as we build membership and invest in content improvements.   Given our expected return to global profitability in Q2, and how well we’ve been received in the UK,  we’ve decided to open an additional attractive European market in Q4 of this year.   Assuming  continued success, and additional markets we can enter with confidence, we expect to roughly match  the roll-out of new markets to global profitability for the foreseeable future.    DVD  DVD members declined this quarter to 10.1 million, slightly better than our expectations. About 7  million of these 10 million also subscribe to our streaming service.  Going forward, we believe DVD will  continue to decline but at a slower pace than the past few quarters.      The domestic DVD segment delivered $146 million of contribution profit in Q1, representing a 46%  contribution margin. We expect contribution margin to be roughly flat in coming quarters.   Product Improvement & Partnering  We are constantly working to improve the Netflix experience so our members can easily sign up, find  something great to watch and then relax and enjoy our service.  Q1 was no exception in terms of  continual improvements to the service.   As mentioned above, we improved our Latin American customer experience by increasing subtitle  coverage to nearly one hundred percent of non-kids content, while in the UK and Ireland, we launched  our most thorough Facebook integration to date, allowing members to share what they watch on      8  Facebook and giving them the ability to get great viewing ideas from their friends. We also continued  our efforts to better serve families, launching our “Just for Kids” feature on the PS3 as a follow up to the  successful launches of this feature on the website, Apple TV, and Wii.   Finally, based on successful test  results, we rolled out a smarter personalization algorithm to determine members’ Top 10 suggested title  lists.       In March, we launched a deeper integration with the Apple TV, allowing consumers to sign up for Netflix  directly on device and pay via their iTunes account.  We’ve been very pleased that this simplification for  new users has been popular, and that the integration has gone so well.  Members who sign up through  Apple TV are full Netflix members, and can use Netflix on multiple devices. The Apple TV relationship  covers all of our markets.       Many companies like Apple already have a billing relationship with millions of people, including ISPs,  major retailers, MVPDs, and others.   In cases where these firms have an efficient means to generate  demand for Netflix, and can provide a very simple way to add a Netflix line item to the existing bill, it  may make sense for us to let them bill on our behalf.   We’ll take it slowly; we must make sure we’ve got  the right customer support and financial integration, while maintaining a direct relationship with our  members, to ensure the member experience is actually simpler.  Our Apple TV integration is one  example where we have accomplished that.     Original Programming  When we embarked on original programming, it was a strategic experiment.   We’ve gained enough  confidence and perspective that we now view it as a strategic expansion.   In particular, we are now  treating it as a capability we should build, like international, to achieve our long-term ambitions.   What  is still uncertain is when or whether we will take it beyond 5% of our large content spend.   We’ll take it  year by year, and see how good we can get at originals for our members.     One way to think of originals is in terms of brand halo.   If we are able to generate critical success for our  originals, it will elevate our consumer brand and drive incremental members to the service.   That took  HBO nearly a decade to accomplish, so we don’t expect overnight results.  The breadth of media  coverage we already get, though, for the highly anticipated new season of “Arrested Development”, as  well as for “Lilyhammer” and “House of Cards”, has been great.      Another way to think of originals is vertical integration; can we remove enough inefficiency from the  show launch process that we can acquire content more cheaply through licensing shows directly rather  than going through distributors who have already launched a show?  Our on-demand and personalized  platform means that we don’t have to assemble a mass audience at say, 8pm on Sunday, to watch the  first episode.  Instead, we can give producers the opportunity to deliver us great serialized shows and  we can cost-efficiently build demand over time, with members discovering these new franchises much  in the same way they’ve discovered and come to love shows like “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.”  In this  regard, we are happy to report that in terms of cost per viewing hour, which is how we evaluate content      9  efficiency, “Lilyhammer” so far performs in line with similar premium exclusive content that we  currently license.  Finally, a third way to think about originals is as a hedge, in case, say, FX chooses not to license us prior  seasons of their next hit as good as “Sons of Anarchy”.  FX in this case would seek to monetize prior  seasons of their next hit in parallel to how HBO does, in other words, only on “FX GO”.    As long as we  can better monetize prior seasons, through both scale and technology, than anyone else, then this  scenario is not likely, except from a premium TV competitor like HBO that is strategically motivated to  impede our growth.    We know we have a lot to learn in the originals area.   In terms of early results, we exceeded our targets  on “Lilyhammer” in terms of PR, viewing, and critical acclaim.   The show has driven millions of hours  viewed, is rated highly (4 out of 5 stars on average) and generated hundreds of millions of consumer  impressions with a comparatively small PR and marketing spend. In the quarter, we announced another  original premiering in 2013, “Hemlock Grove”, a one-hour 13 episode series from Eli Roth and Gaumont  International TV based on Brian McGreevy’s gothic horror novel.    As we build our capability in originals, we will have some advantages relative to our competitors.  Namely, we have extensive user viewing history and ratings data to allow us to better understand  potential appeal of future programs, as well as a very broad and already segmented audience. At the  same time, we don’t face the same pressure as linear or ad-supported online networks to deliver  ratings. Finally, we should be able to use our size and international scale to bring the best original and  exclusive content from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. This is a real advantage over  our regional competitors.   Global Profitability: Q1 Results & Outlook  Q1 net loss of ($5) million, and ($0.08) per share, was better than our expectations, predominantly  driven by the outperformance in both domestic and international streaming contribution profit, in  addition to slightly lower global Tech & Dev and G&A costs than anticipated.  Looking forward to Q2, sequential growth in domestic streaming contribution profit will offset the  decline in DVD contribution profit from Q1, while improvements in profitability in each of the  international markets will reduce the international losses by approximately $11 million (based on the  midpoint of guidance). As a result, we are forecasting a much earlier return to global profitability than  anticipated on a Q2 net income / (loss) range of ($6) to $8 million. The improvement in the outlook is a  result of continued member growth (both domestically and internationally), as well as increased  efficiency of our content and marketing spending.  As described above, looking past Q2 and our expected return to international expansion this year, we  expect to invest the growing profits from our domestic business in additional global expansion in order  to both position ourselves to be the first to scale in each of our international markets, as well as  expedite reaching such global scale that will allow us to license global content rights economically.       10    Free Cash Flow   In Q1, despite our net loss of ($5) million, we generated positive FCF of $2 million. Significant sources of  cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation, depreciation  expense in excess of PP&E purchases, and accrued interest on our notes, which more than offset cash  payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense) and cash payments for taxes relative to the P&L  benefit for income taxes.   In general, FCF and net income track each other reasonably closely with the primary exception of  payments for original content.  Originals will not materially impact free cash flow until the second half of  this year and will ramp in 2013 as we add more original programs.  We finished the quarter with $805 million in cash and equivalents.

As we grow,  we are trying to balance prudence and ambition while keeping a strong focus on member satisfaction.  We work hard every day to make our service even better.   Our rapid return to profitability, enabling  further international expansion, is very gratifying.

      "1    July 24th, 2012      Dear Fellow Shareholders,  In Q2, we achieved financial performance in the top half of our guidance in nearly every metric, and  have returned to profitability.    66 months ago, we launched Netflix streaming in the US with limited selection.   Now, we have 24  million domestic streaming members and an incredible selection of TV shows and movies.  Networks  that license us prior season TV shows are in several cases benefiting from record audience numbers in  the current season, partly due to the availability and promotion of prior seasons on Netflix. We are  growing our business, and helping to grow the entire industry.    22 months ago, we launched our first international market:  Canada.  Since then we’ve grown to over  10% of Canadian households, made substantial increases in our content selection, and achieved enough  scale to begin to generate contribution profits.    10 months ago, we launched Netflix in Latin America.  Recently we surpassed one million members in  the region and announced that one of the year’s biggest films, “The Hunger Games”, would debut on  our service only five months after its theatrical release.  With a population ten times the size of Canada,  Latin America remains a huge opportunity for us.   6 months ago, we launched Netflix in the UK and Ireland, and today we are one million members strong.    We believe we have pulled ahead of LOVEFiLM in every important streaming-related metric. Going  forward, competing effectively with Sky is our core and substantial challenge.     This growth in each of our markets reflects our investment in an easy-to-use personalized selection  experience, ever more compelling content, and higher quality streaming delivery.   Device by device,  title by title, network by network, market by market, we are constantly improving our service.   Q3 has begun strongly for us, and we expect to be profitable again in Q3.   In Q4, we will launch our next international market, which will drive us temporarily back into the red.    We have enormous challenges ahead, and no doubt will have further ups and downs as we pioneer  Internet television.  We are making progress in every market we serve, and see a once-in-a-generation  opportunity ahead to build the world’s most popular TV show and movie service.    Our summary results follow:           2      Domestic Streaming  Q2 Results & Outlook  As we forecasted and explained in our April letter, domestic net additions will be more seasonal in 2012  compared to 2010 (2011 is an anomaly due to our mid-year price changes).  Roughly speaking, we would  therefore expect our net adds to be about equal to 2010 in Q1 and Q3, lower in Q2, and higher in Q4,  even given no change in the seasonality of gross adds.      Q2 came in as we expected, which is about 50% fewer domestic net adds than in Q2 2010.   For Q3 quarter-to-date, our domestic net additions are very nearly the same as Q3 2010 over the  comparable partial period.  In that quarter two years ago, we finished with 1.8 million domestic net  additions. However, in the middle of that quarter, we launched Netflix on the iPhone to great reception,   (in millions except per share data) Q2 '11 Q3 '11 Q4 '11 Q1 '12 Q2 '12 Domestic Streaming: Net Subscription Additions  -    -   0.22 1.74 0.53 Total Subscriptions  -   21.45 21.67 23.41 23.94 Paid Subscriptions  -   20.51 20.15 22.02 22.69 Revenue  -    -   $            476  $            507  $            533  Contribution Profit  -    -   $              52  $              67  $              83  Contribution Margin  -    -   10.9% 13.2% 15.6% International Streaming: Net Subscription Additions 0.16 0.51 0.38 1.21 0.56 Total Subscriptions 0.97 1.48 1.86 3.07 3.62 Paid Subscriptions 0.86 0.99 1.45 2.41 3.02 Revenue  $              19  $              23  $              29  $              43  $              65  Contribution Profit (Loss)  $              (9)  $            (23)  $            (60)  $          (103)  $            (89) Domestic DVD: Net Subscription Additions  -    -   (2.76) (1.08) (0.85) Total Subscriptions  -   13.93 11.17 10.09 9.24 Paid Subscriptions  -   13.81 11.04 9.96 9.15 Revenue  -    -   $            370  $            320  $            291  Contribution Profit  -    -   $            194  $            146  $            134  Contribution Margin  -    -   52.4% 45.6% 46.0% Global: Revenue  $            789  $            822  $            876  $            870  $            889  Net Income (Loss)  $              68  $              62  $              35  $              (5)  $                6  EPS  $           1.26  $           1.16  $           0.64  $         (0.08)  $           0.11  Free Cash Flow  $              60  $              14  $              34  $                2  $              11  Shares (FD) 53.9 53.9 55.4 55.5 58.8     3    and we don’t have an equivalent launch this quarter. Moreover, this quarter the Olympics are likely to  have a negative impact on Netflix viewing and sign-ups.  So, our Q3 guidance is 1 million to 1.8 million  domestic net adds. If we finish Q3 in the high end of that range, we would remain on track for 7 million  domestic net additions for the year; otherwise it would be challenging to achieve that goal by year end.   In either case, we are generating impressive growth this year in our most developed market.    Our per-member viewing continues to rise on a year-over-year basis.   As our service improves,  members are choosing more often to enjoy Netflix.  The more members enjoy Netflix, the longer they  stay with us, and the more passionately they evangelize Netflix to their friends.     Our reputation with our members and their likelihood to recommend the Netflix service is steadily  improving.  Our original thesis was three years to full brand recovery (subsequent to the DVD-related  price increases last summer), and that seems correct so far.     Our domestic streaming contribution margin improved 200+ basis points sequentially for the second  consecutive quarter to 15.6% (up from 13.2% in Q1 and 10.9% in Q4), surpassing the year end  contribution margin target we outlined back in Q4 2011. The Q2 margin expansion was predominantly  driven by the planned sequential decline in marketing expense, while content expenses grew in line with  revenue (as compared to Q1). For Q3, our guidance implies a further 100 bps expansion in contribution  margin.   Looking out beyond Q3, we will continue to target gradual margin expansion of about 100 bps  per quarter, but any given quarter may see flatness sequentially as we accommodate lumpiness in  content library additions and the seasonality of subscriber net adds.    Domestic Content   Every quarter, we add fresh film and TV titles and episodes to our domestic content library, and we  continue to see good returns on these investments in the form of increased hours viewed by our  members.  Q2 domestic median hours viewed per member grew substantially year-over-year and total  hours were at record levels.   In the past, we have explained that the evolution of video streaming services to a large extent reflects  the legacy of television networks: namely, a reliance on exclusive content as a differentiator. Consistent  with this practice, we have increasingly licensed content on an exclusive basis, including titles such as  “Mad Men”, “Breaking Bad” and “Gossip Girl”.  This quarter we continued this practice, further  differentiating our service through a multi-year exclusive agreement with Warner Bros. for complete  previous seasons of hit shows “Pretty Little Liars” and “The Lying Game”.  Exclusivity on the film side is also relevant, and we continue to pursue both exclusive and non-exclusive  deals with our partners.  There are many different kinds of exclusivity in this area.  With EPIX, we  currently have exclusivity for online distribution, but EPIX is increasingly distributed by MVPD and TV  Everywhere.   Our online exclusivity expires shortly, but our agreement to carry EPIX content non- exclusively runs through mid-2013. On the strength of Paramount’s and Lionsgate’s film slates in 2011  and 2012, EPIX has become a great product and we look forward to our ongoing relationship.       4     We continue pursuing innovative deals with others.  One such deal is an output arrangement with The  Weinstein Company that will allow us to have an exclusive window for theatrical titles that will begin  after the expiration of their first Pay window.  This first-of-a-kind deal will give Netflix members access  to all Weinstein theatrical films in what had traditionally been the first Free TV window -- just 12 months  from the start of the Pay TV window, as opposed to the traditional holdback of nearly 8 years. Among  the titles we will soon have are last year’s Academy Award winner, “The King’s Speech” and the highly  acclaimed “Blue Valentine”.  Next year we’ll get “My Week with Marilyn” and “The Iron Lady”.  In the meantime, our current feature film offering is better than ever with the arrival of “Thor”,  “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”, and “Immortals” which, together, generated more than $1.2 billion  in domestic box office.  In the coming months, we’ll see additional great titles including crowd pleasers  like, “Captain America”, “Abduction”, “Super 8” and “Margin Call” along with critically acclaimed films  like this year’s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, “The Artist”, plus “Albert Nobbs” and  “Bernie”.   Over time, we will have one of the best feature film offerings in the market as more than one  third of the US box office generated year-to-date are from titles that will flow through our current deals  including “The Hunger Games”, “The Avengers” and “The Lorax” from major studios and “Act of Valor”,  “Mirror, Mirror” and “The Grey” from our mini-major partners.  We have often said that our licensing of complete back seasons of on-air TV series is not only a great  experience for Netflix members, but can help build the audience for new seasons of these series. Last  quarter, the audience for season five of “Mad Men” swelled subsequent to prior seasons becoming  available on Netflix. Last week, the fifth season of “Breaking Bad” debuted to record numbers, up 14%  from last year’s premiere, no doubt buttressed by new viewers who were introduced to the series on  Netflix.  “Sons of Anarchy” on FX and “The Walking Dead” on AMC are additional examples of shows that  have seen season over season viewership growth with the availability of the complete series on Netflix.  Our unique ability to help members catch up at whatever point in the life of a series that suits them is  just one way we add value to our partners when they license their content to Netflix.   Domestic Competition   As we’ve explained in the past, we compete for consumers’ viewing time with a variety of video services,  including linear TV, DVRs, over-the-top (OTT) pure plays, and authenticated streaming offerings of the  MVPDs and cable networks (TV Everywhere).   We have yet to see HuluPlus or Amazon Prime Instant Video gain meaningful traction relative to our  viewing hours, but as we continue to build a domestic profit stream they are likely to increase their  efforts to gain viewing share.  Redbox Instant by Verizon, once they launch, will face a big challenge to  break into the top 3 of subscription streaming services.  We believe our biggest long-term competition for viewing hours will come from MVPDs and cable  networks, both directly and through their TV Everywhere offerings.  MVPDs continue to improve their      5    offering, and Comcast’s X1 interface, shown off at the recent cable show, is an impressive and leading  example of this work.  Our task is to keep raising the bar by operating on Internet pace, so that by the  time Comcast broadly rolls out X1 over the coming years, we’ll be another generation ahead in member- pleasing experiences.    As for HBO, they continue to do great work with HBO GO, which is now available to most US households  that subscribe to the premium service.   While we compete for content and viewing time with HBO, it is  also possible we will find opportunities to work together – just as we do with other networks.    Consumers who are passionate about movies and TV shows are quite willing to subscribe to multiple  services.     International Streaming   We added nearly 0.6 million international streaming members in Q2, ending the quarter with 3.6 million  international members. Compared to Q1, average paid subscribers increased 41% in the quarter as we  continued to attract new members and convert free trials into paying subscribers. Our total  international subscriber base came in slightly lower than our forecast in April as we implemented  several up-front checks to validate consumer payment methods in Latin America. These changes  reduced our free trials relative to the forecast, but had limited impact on paid subscriber numbers. Our  international segment now represents 13% of total Netflix streaming members, and slightly over half of  the streaming net additions in the quarter.    UK and Ireland   Following our successful launch in the UK and Ireland in Q1, we are encouraged by the continued strong  growth of the service and today have one million members.  This growth has been driven, in part, by our  investments in content.  Over the past quarter, we have added great movies to the service, including the  critically acclaimed “Drive” and the family comedy “Zookeeper” in the Pay 1 TV window and recent  blockbusters “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs”, “Transformers” and “Mission Impossible III”.  We  have also strengthened our TV offering.  Over the past three months, we launched all six seasons of the  hit series “Lost”, premiered the third season of the gritty drama “Breaking Bad”, and became the  exclusive home in the UK and Ireland of the indie comedy series “Portlandia”.  We will continue to expand and refresh our content offering in the coming quarter.  Notable new titles  will include the action-adventure film “Abduction”, the sentimental buddy comedy “50/50” and  blockbusters “2012” and “Iron Man 2.”  Through our recently announced deal with Twentieth Century  Fox, we will be making available several top US TV series in Q3, including “Sons of Anarchy”, “The Killing”  and the Emmy-winning “Modern Family”.  Subscribers can also look forward to the next seasons of  “Breaking Bad” and “Damages” exclusively on Netflix. As with all of our markets, our content additions  are targeted to deliver incremental viewing, and therefore drive higher engagement and retention of  our members.       6    Looking past Q3, we feel our existing partnerships with local broadcasters and producers, US studios and  networks, and independent partners will continue to provide us access to compelling content.  For  example, our upcoming Pay 1 feature films account for 16% of UK Box Office year-to-date, compared to  an estimated 5% for LOVEFiLM’s streaming service.   When we launched, we said Sky would be our primary competitor in the UK, and now we potentially  face increased competition from Sky’s new OTT service “Now TV” at £15 per month, more than double  our price. This is Sky’s first foray into a pure-play OTT streaming product and will likely be marketed  aggressively. Our content libraries are mutually exclusive with no overlap of titles; as such, many  households may subscribe to both services.   Canada   Our Canadian service continues to grow well – in both subscribers and hours viewed. Similar to trends in  the US, Q2 median hours viewed per member were up year-over-year in Canada. We have movies in the  first pay TV window from Paramount and Fox and our members are currently enjoying hit films like “Rise  of the Planet of the Apes”, “Mr. Popper’s Penguins” and “Kung Fu Panda 2”. As in the US, the first four  seasons of “Breaking Bad” and all six seasons of “Lost” are setting viewing records in Canada for us.  We  achieved a small contribution profit in Canada in Q2 and expect to remain profitable in this market going  forward, as we manage our content and marketing expenses to grow more slowly than members and  revenue. We intend to steadily increase our contribution margin in much the same way as we are doing  for our US streaming business.   Latin America  In less than a year since expanding our service to Latin America, we are excited that we have more than  one million members. At the same time, given the huge market opportunity, we remain focused on  accelerating our growth by overcoming some of the many unique challenges in the region, namely, low  device penetration, an under-developed Internet infrastructure and consumer payment challenges for  ecommerce.  We are making progress in the area of payments. We have modified our sign-up flow to improve free  trial to paid subscriber conversion, and are in the process of expanding payment options in Mexico and  Brazil.  We are also closely tracking the performance of our content library to figure out the right formula for  adding content that results in higher viewing and therefore greater member engagement, retention and  positive word of mouth.  We’re encouraged that the content additions we’ve made are having an  impact.   Our newest Mexican members are now watching more Netflix than their counterparts in the  US, Canada, or the UK.         7    Our content in the region keeps getting better. Global blockbuster “The Hunger Games” will debut on  our service in August, only five months after its worldwide theatrical release and on the same date as it  will be released on DVD and VOD in the region.  Additionally, our new deal with FOX has given Latin  American members access to hit shows such as, “Glee”, “How I Met Your Mother”, “24” and “Prison  Break”. Additionally, we are adding episodes of “South Park” and other on-air TV Series, such as,  “Revenge”, “Once upon a Time”, “Parenthood”, “Parks and Recreation” and “Franklin & Bash”. The  fourth season of “Breaking Bad” debuts for us in Latin America in September.  While challenges remain in the region, with subscribers and revenue growing, we are on-track to  capture the big opportunity that the region represents.   Next International Market   Given our return to global profitability this quarter and our continued success in the UK, we announced  last quarter that we’ve decided to open an additional attractive European market in Q4 of this year. We  will have more to say about this market later in Q3.    Total International Results & Outlook     Total international revenue of $65 million in Q2 increased 50% sequentially driven by the overall growth  in international members and the conversion of free trials to paid subscribers in both Latin America and  the UK and Ireland.  Total contribution loss of $89 million improved by $13 million compared to Q1, as  subscriber revenue growth exceeded the growth of content expenses while marketing expenses  declined post-UK launch.    Looking forward to Q3, we are guiding to a small increase in the international loss relative to Q2. Similar  to our experience in Canada last fall, the market opportunity we are experiencing in the UK is compelling  enough that we intend to grow our content spend to expand the library and to drive additional growth  in subscribers and viewing. Ultimately, our long-term goal in each market is to become the first  streaming service to reach scale, allowing us to achieve profitability and to expand margins over the  long-term.     We expect to exceed 4 million total international members in Q3, with another half million net additions  in the quarter (at the mid-point of guidance), consistent with Q2’s net additions.  Our outlook assumes  that viewing of the summer Olympics in July will dampen acquisitions across all of our markets.   DVD  DVD subscriptions declined this quarter to 9.2 million, in-line with our expectations. About 6.7 million of  these 9.2 million also subscribe to our streaming service. The domestic DVD segment delivered $134  million of contribution profit in Q2, representing a 46% contribution margin, comparable to the Q1      8    margin. Going forward, we believe DVD member declines will continue to moderate, while contribution  margin will be roughly flat for the remainder of the year.  The first round of USPS processing center  reductions took effect in the first week of July.  So far, we see minimal service related impact from these  reductions.  Original Programming  Progress continues in the production of our previously announced original programs: “House of Cards”  began filming in Baltimore in April, “Arrested Development” and “Orange Is the New Black” are in the  writing phase, and principal photography has just begun on “Hemlock Grove”.  We look forward to the  debut of the entire first season of “House of Cards” in early 2013, and “Arrested Development” after  that. Additionally, we expect to deliver a second season of “Lillyhammer” in 2013 and our original  content team is working on expanding this lineup further.   Product Improvement  Our technology and development spending reflects our continued investments in improving the Netflix  experience.  In Q2, these investments produced improved Netflix players for both PC and Mac, as well as  the continued expansion of our “Just for Kids” feature, already on PC, Mac, Wii, PS3 and Apple TV, and  coming soon to the Xbox and iPad. In addition, we rolled out globally the much improved catalog sorting  algorithms that we initially launched in Q1 in the US, and added incremental search capabilities (such as  search by actor or director) to the PS3, with plans to roll-out this feature to other devices quickly.    Given our size and growth, it now makes economic sense for Netflix to have its own content delivery  network (CDN). As a result, we recently announced that we are enabling ISPs to get Netflix video data  from Open Connect, a single-purpose Netflix CDN. We’ll continue to work with our commercial CDN  partners for the next few years, but eventually our data will be largely served by Open Connect. Like  commercial CDNs, Open Connect will provide the Netflix data at no cost to the locations the ISP desires,  or ISPs can choose to get the Netflix data at common Internet exchanges. About 10% of Netflix data is  already being served by Open Connect.   Global Profitability:  Q2 Results & Outlook  We achieved our goal of returning to global profitability this quarter by posting $6 million of net income,  and $0.11 EPS. Compared to Q1, margin expansion of the domestic streaming segment delivered an  incremental $17 million of contribution profit, more than offsetting the $12 million decline of DVD  contribution profit. Meanwhile, international losses moderated by $13 million and global operating  expenses (Technology & Development and G & A) were flat relative to Q1.     Our highly profitable US business, both streaming and DVD, is funding our international expansion. We  believe this is the right long-term approach.  In Q3, we expect to be profitable, while with the launch of  a fourth international market in Q4, we will move to a consolidated loss.       9        Free Cash Flow   In Q2, positive free cash flow of $11 million was roughly equivalent to our consolidated net income of $6  million and improved quarter-over-quarter largely because of the sequential improvement in net  income. Significant sources of cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock  compensation, depreciation expense in excess of PP&E purchases, and miscellaneous increases to  accounts payable and accrued expenses, which more than offset cash payments for content (in excess of  the P&L expense) and our bi-annual cash payment for interest on our notes.  In general, free cash flow and net income track each other reasonably closely with the primary  exception of payments for certain content deals (including original content and some output deals). We  expect content payments to cause free cash flow to trail net income in Q3. The use of cash for originals  will increase in Q4 and 2013 as we add more original programs.   We finished the quarter with $813 million in cash and equivalents.   New CMO - Kelly Bennett   We were excited yesterday to announce the appointment of Kelly Bennett as our Chief Marketing  Officer. Kelly comes to Netflix after nearly a decade at Warner Bros. where he was most recently Vice  President Interactive, World Wide Marketing with the pictures group, leading international online  campaigns for Warner Bros. movies. Before that Kelly ran digital marketing for Warner Bros. Pictures in  Europe, the Middle East and Africa and worked in promotion and business development in the  company.   His bio is at http://www.linkedin.com/in/kellybennett.           10    Business Outlook        Domestic Streaming: Total Subscriptions 24.9 m to 25.7 m Paid Subscriptions 23.5 m to 24.1 m Revenue $552 m to $559 m Contribution Profit $85 m to $95 m International Streaming  Total Subscriptions 3.9 m to 4.4 m Paid Subscriptions 3.3 m to 3.8 m Revenue $72 m to $79 m Contribution Profit (Loss) ($105 m) to ($93 m) Domestic DVD: Total Subscriptions 8.35 m to 8.65 m Paid Subscriptions 8.3 m to 8.6 m Revenue $266 m to $273 m Contribution Profit $120 m to $132 m Consolidated Global: Net Income (Loss) ($6 m) to $8 m EPS ($0.10) to $0.14 Q3 2012 Guidance     11    Summary  Our core thesis is that we can build a large defensible global business as an Internet network for TV  shows and movies.  Our technology and our content are both huge advantages in getting us to scale;  with scale comes further ability to invest.   We know our shareholders are depending on us to succeed at  our global expansion, market by market, and eventually return to substantial global profits.  Our growing  US streaming contribution profit stream shows what is possible.   We can’t wait to serve a global  audience with an amazing Internet video experience.

      "The Internnet is transforming video eentertainmennt, stream by stream, conssumer by consumer, nation by nation. Ouur opportunitty is to be onee of the leadeers of this transformation with the bestt streaming vvideo subscriptiion service onn the planet. The last feww months, howwever, have bbeen difficult for shareholdders, employeees, and most uunfortunatelyy, many memmbers of Netflix. While wee dramaticallyy improved our $7.99 unlimited streamming service bby embracing new platformms, simplifyinng our user‐innterface, and more than doubbling domestiic spending on streaming ccontent over 2010, we greeatly upset many domesticc Netflix meembers with our significannt DVD‐related pricing changes, and to a lesser degree, with the proposed‐and‐now‐cancelled rebranding of our DVD service. In doing so, we’ve hurt oour hard‐earned reputation, and stalledd our domestiic growth. But our long‐terrm streamingg opportunityy is as compellling as ever annd we are mooving forward as quickly ass we can to reepair our repuutation and reeturn to growwth. 1DVD andd Streamingg We think that $7.99 foor unlimited sttreaming andd $7.99 for unnlimited DVD are both veryy aggressive llow prices, rellative to competition and tto the value oof the servicees, and they aare the right pplace for Netfflix to be in the long term. WWhat we misjuudged was hoow quickly to move there. We compouunded the problem wwith our lack of explanatioon about the rising cost of the expansioon of streaminng content, and steady DVVD costs, so thhat absent thhat explanatioon, many percceived us as ggreedy. Finally, we annouunced and then retracted a seeparate brand for DVD. WWhile this brannding incidennt further dennted our reputation, and causedd a temporaryy cancellationn surge, comppared to our price change,, its impact wwas relatively minor. Our pprimary issuee is many of our long‐term members fellt shocked byy the pricing changes, aand more of tthem have exxpressed thatt by cancellingg Netflix thann we expectedd. Because oof this, our revenue and prrofits in Q4 wwill be lower thhan we had aanticipated, bbut we’ll remaain profitablee on a global bbasis. In Q1’112 we’ll be lauunching in thee UK and Irelaand, as we haad planned. FFor a few quartters starting in Q1, we expect the costs of our entry into the UK aand Ireland wwill push us to be unprofitable on a global basis; that is, domestic profits will noot be large ennough to bothh cover internatioonal investmeents and pay ffor global G&&A and Technoology & Deveelopment. Aftter launchingg the UK and Ireeland, we will pause on oppening new innternational mmarkets until we return too global profitabiliity. We plan to do that byy increasing oour global streeaming subsccriber base faster than we increase oour costs. Investors and memberrs will be relieeved to know we are donee with pricing changes, andd that at $7.999 each for sstreaming andd DVD we cann move forwaard for a long time. Some inveestors have asked us abouut the combinnation or “hybbrid” offeringg in the U.S. In our currentt signup floow, we offer tthree choices: (a) streaminng only at $7.999, (b) DVD oonly at $7.99, and (c) both,, for $15.98. AAbout 7% of nnew memberss choose the $15.98 hybridd offering. OOne could arggue that this percentagge would incrrease if we reduced the price for hybridd, but if we were going to llower prices, we would do it on streamiing. Our futuure is in rapiddly expandingg streaming, bbut we will maake sure thatt current hyybrid subscribbers continuee to get a greaat and stable experience. As of today, less than hallf of our streamming subscribbers also subsscribe to our DVD service, and we expeect that numbber to continuue to fall, given that only 7%% of new streaaming subscriibers also currrently sign upp for DVD. We see a huge global oopportunity for our $7.99 unlimited strreaming service, as indicatted by reachinng 10% of Caanadian houseehold penetration in just oone year sincee launching sservice there. In the U.S., wwe’ll build backk our brand thhe same way we built it in the first placce: no grand gestures, just amazing serrvice day‐after‐‐day, for an inncredibly low price. Q3 Dommestic Resullts We endedd the quarter with 21.4 miillion streaminng subscriptioons and 13.9 million DVD subscriptionss. Unique doomestic subsccribers declinned to 23.8 million subscribbers, driven bboth by a highher than expeected level of caancellations aand a reductioon in acquisitions driven by the PR storm that engulfed our brandd and its impactt on word‐of‐mouth.

      "In Q3, our global streaming membership grew by nearly 2 million, and our 29 million streaming members enjoyed over 3 billion hours of TV shows and movies from Netflix. We have compelling exclusive content, an outstanding member experience, and a brand that stands for high quality streaming entertainment. These strengths, combined with the industry-wide forces of improving Internet devices and bandwidth, are fueling our rapid growth around the world. Our summary results for Q3 2012 follow: 1Domestic Streaming Q3 Results and Q4 Outlook In Q3 we grew to 25.1 million domestic streaming members, on a guidance range of 24.9 to 25.7 million. For Q4, our guidance is for our U.S. membership base to increase to between 26.4 and 27.1 million, up more than 20% year over year from where we started the year at 21.7 million members. In Q3 we grew our contribution margin to 16.4%. For Q4, we are targeting 17%, an improvement of 60 basis points quarter over quarter and 600 basis points year over year from 10.9% last Q4. Membership satisfaction is very high, as seen in two key metrics: we increased our per member viewing in Q3 by more than 30% (year over year) to record highs by improving our content and member experience; and our voluntary churn is generally the lowest it has ever been.1 In contrast, involuntary churn has been increasing as we grow more mainstream and attract more lower-income households. Gross acquisitions continue to grow on a year over year basis. We also continue to see strength in repeat customers. While we are not growing membership as fast as in 2010, we think that over time nearly all U.S. households will be broadband households, nearly all video will be Internet video, and that as our content and member experience continue to improve faster than competitors, our long-term domestic market opportunity remains 2-3x that of linear HBO. Domestic Streaming Content Our members continue to enjoy TV shows from Netflix in huge numbers. About two thirds of our viewing is now episodic content, and about one third is movies. Both are important to us and our members. For on-demand movies, consumers today have many options at home, including $1.20 per night DVD from Redbox, DVR-recorded movies from premium and basic networks, DVD purchase and transactional on-demand offerings, like VOD or EST. In comparison, Netflix has better content discovery, is simpler to use, and is on all Internet screens. So our movie offering is substantially, but not amazingly, better than other movie options for consumers. 1 There are two components of churn/retention: “voluntary” which is members cancelling their service, and “involuntary” which is Netflix cancelling their service due to our inability to collect from their debit/credit card. For any set of members, churn declines over time as one would expect. Therefore, to detect trends, we look at churn/retention at various points in time across our members’ lifetimes, such as month 6 to month 7, for example. 2For serialized TV shows, however, we do offer an amazingly better experience, because our members can start right from the pilot episode of season one and watch multiple seasons at their own pace. Neither Redbox DVD nor the DVR truly offers this capability. Buying expensive boxed-set DVDs or even more expensive seasons of $2 episodes on VOD are the only other options for enjoying this “discover a show” behavior. Our high relative advantage in TV shows is part of why our viewing is now about two thirds TV shows. Of our top ten TV shows, six are only on Netflix, and not available on Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video, or HBO GO. The ratio is slightly higher for our top 50 TV shows. We have a very unique and compelling offering. While we were interested in keeping Epix movies exclusive to Netflix, we and Epix could not reach terms that made sense to both of us. We could better spend the incremental dollars on high profile TV titles. The movies from Epix constitute only about 5% of our viewing, and we continue to have them, on a non- exclusive basis. We will be a bidder for future fully exclusive studio output deals for movies as they become available. In general, to maintain a great service and low prices, we have to be choosy about what we are licensing for Netflix. Given the high volume of programming available on Netflix, titles come into and out of license nearly every day. Suppliers, of course, are incentivized to talk about how important their particular offering is to our service, and it can be concerning to investors to read stories of content non- renewal. We strive to offer our subscribers exceptional levels of high quality premium content choices. In order to do that, we have to make sure that relative to the cost of that content, we are making wise programming choices. Overall, Netflix now has a more engaging mix of movies and TV shows than it has ever had and continues to improve, as seen in our considerable growth in per member viewing. Our licensing teams are expert programmers informed by more than a decade of rich data on viewer preferences and viewing habits which allows them to license an overall mix of compelling content to uniquely please Netflix members. Our Netflix Originals are an integral part of our global content strategy, and we’ll go into more detail about them below. International Streaming We added nearly 0.7 million international streaming members in Q3, ending the quarter with 4.3 million international members. Net additions were at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting stronger than forecasted subscriber growth in each of our international markets. 3Nordics We launched our service in the Nordics (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) just last week, and have been very pleased by the positive reception. Since this is our fourth regional launch, we were able to apply what we’ve learned from our previous market launches to optimize the content programming library and marketing. In our first week of service, we attracted more free trial members than we did in our first week of service in Canada, so we are hopeful of a Canada-like success in the Nordics. Nordics members are not in our Q3 results, since the launch was in October. U.K. and Ireland As announced in August, we are currently over 1 million members strong in the U.K. and Ireland and continued to see strong growth in Q3. The U.K./Ireland market is expensive for content due to the competition with Sky and Amazon LOVEFiLM. We are very happy to be ahead of LOVEFiLM, and intend to continue to expand our content and grow our members rapidly. As we expected, the U.K./Ireland market will take materially longer than Canada to get to profitability, given the high level of competition and the continued expansion of our content. Latin America We have over 1 million members in Latin America, and there are over 50 million broadband households across these growing economies. Our service is working very well and voluntary churn is low in most of the region. We are growing rapidly, and we continue to add more content, especially in Brazil. Per-member viewing is up substantially from launch one year ago. We are outpacing all of our competitors. The biggest issue holding back much stronger growth is payments. For a variety of reasons, many Latin American broadband households are leery of, or unable to, provide debit/credit cards that can be accepted over the Internet. For those who do provide us debit/credit cards, we see higher rates of payment declines than in our other markets. Since these are households who are successfully paying for 4    5    home broadband, we should be able to improve our effectiveness.  We are working hard on all avenues  to address these issues and accelerate our growth.  In the long term, as ecommerce further develops in  Latin America, these issues will lessen.     It will take longer than we had planned to get to profitability in Latin America, but we are confident that  this will be a very large and profitable market for us long term.       Canada    Canada continues to be a very strong market for us. Two years have passed since launch, and our  subscriber growth is steady to slightly accelerating.  Both retention and engagement are high among our  Canadian members.    We expanded our profitability in Canada in Q3 as revenue grew more quickly than content expense, and  we intend to steadily expand our contribution margin over time, even as we continue to add more  content.     Total International Results & Outlook    Total international contribution loss of $92 million was slightly higher than the $89 million loss in Q2, as  we decided to capitalize on our strong U.K./Ireland momentum by investing additionally in our content  library to drive more membership growth and more viewing.     In Q4, as we launched the Nordics, we expect international contribution losses to increase to  approximately $113 million (guidance midpoint) as we will have incremental content and marketing  expenses but minimal revenue yet from this market. We intend this to be our peak quarter of  international losses, and expect international losses will decline quarter by quarter next year.  Once  we’ve substantially reduced international losses, and with Netflix then being solidly profitable on a  global basis, we will launch our next round of international expansion.       Our aggressive investments today in international expansion have laid the foundation for building long- term profitable franchises in these markets, just as we have already done in Canada.  Consumers around  the world want Internet TV, and we are providing it for them in each of our markets.               6    Streaming Competition    With big markets comes competition. Since the transition from linear TV to Internet TV provides a  staggeringly large long-term opportunity, it is not surprising that we are seeing more competitors vying  for consumers’ time and money.    One class of competitors are MVPDs and around the world they are getting better, offering on-demand  services through DVRs, and TV Everywhere extensions like Xfinity.com.  The prices charged by cable and  satellite services are generally $50 to $100 per month, and we are a supplemental entertainment choice  in comparison to these competitors.  When we compare our viewing growth in those U.S. markets  served by leading MVPDs offering TV Everywhere, versus the nation as a whole, we don’t see any  difference. The implication is that even the best TV Everywhere isn’t yet an attractive alternative to  Netflix viewing for Netflix members.    Another class of competitors is other low-cost, globally-ambitious Internet subscription services.  The big  four are Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and HBO.  We each have unique strategies to win share of consumers’  time and spending. Three of us are Internet firms with mostly licensed content, all getting into original  content.  One of us (HBO) is an original content firm getting into the Internet subscription business.  It is  possible that several of us of will be successful since some consumers will subscribe to multiple services,  each of which has unique content.       Hulu operates in Japan and the U.S. and is a joint venture owned by News Corp., Disney, and Comcast.    While there are now around 2 million Hulu Plus members in the U.S., the ownership of Hulu makes it a  wild-card in terms of future evolution as a global competitor.   We believe in terms of U.S. viewing, Hulu  is currently our closest U.S. competitor.   Hulu is investing in producing original content.  Hulu has  commercial interruptions in their paid and free service, unlike Netflix, Amazon and HBO.    Amazon is taking different strategies in the U.K. and the U.S.  In the U.K., Amazon bought the LOVEFiLM  DVD rental service early in 2011, presumably as a launch vehicle for streaming.   For most of 2011,  LOVEFiLM streaming was only available bundled with DVD rental and in late 2011, LOVEFiLM started  offering a standalone streaming service.  Netflix and Amazon LOVEFiLM now compete in the U.K. with  similar price points.  In the U.K., Amazon has Prime, but has not chosen to include streaming video as  part of Prime.  Our analysis of viewing and content says we are already modestly ahead in streaming  viewing and content library, which we are very happy about given the large head-start LOVEFiLM had in  the region.  Our content is substantially distinct from LOVEFiLM’s content.  We will keep investing in  better content, and improving our member experience, which benefits from our global focus on  streaming.    In the U.S., Amazon is bundling streaming with its Prime shipping service, instead of with DVD rental.   The majority of our most popular content is unavailable on Amazon Prime Instant Video, per the  discussion above in the Domestic Streaming Content section.  Our members tell us they’d like more      7    content, not less, so we feel good about our relative content offering. Amazon is investing in original  exclusive content as well. Our estimate is that viewing of Amazon Prime Instant Video has yet to pass  that of Hulu.      HBO is planning to launch a direct-to-consumer Internet subscription service in the Nordics, matching  our low price point.  This will be the first test of our relative strengths in stand-alone subscription video- on-demand.  We think it will make strategic sense eventually for HBO to go direct-to-consumer in the  U.S., and become more of a competitor to Netflix; so, that is our operating assumption, and we are  looking forward to competing in the Nordics.    Since many consumers in that eventuality would subscribe to both HBO and Netflix, we would compete  like any two networks today.  Our content is distinct from their content.  Today we think the U.S.  viewing of HBO GO by HBO’s approximately 29 million domestic subscribers has yet to equal overall  viewing of Hulu or Amazon Prime.     Finally, to be more complete in our assessment, we also compete for time with piracy, ad-supported  streaming services, pay-per-view/VOD and linear programming.  In most markets there are now local  competitors, such as Sky’s Now TV in the U.K. and Viasat’s Viaplay in the Nordics.  And there will surely  be more who will try to build a compelling subscription streaming offering against Netflix, Hulu, Amazon  and HBO.    Against each of our competitors we have some mix of better exclusive content, better member  experience, and a clearer brand identity. We are working to expand these advantages to win even more  of those moments of truth when consumers decide on any given evening what service they turn to first  when looking for entertainment.  Despite this increasing competition, our per member viewing  continues to rise.     Original Programming    Our goal is to produce unique and compelling serialized content for a cost comparable to similar  licensed exclusive content, using these original series to strengthen our reputation and build deeper  emotional ties to consumers.  If we are as successful with originals as we think we will be in Q1, then the  attention paid to Netflix will be positive and substantial, and we’ll have more people joining Netflix than  we would otherwise.     Our first streaming content type was movies.  Then we added licensed prior-season television.   This  third category of content is first window premiere of exclusive serialized episodic television.    We are now in full production of four original series to debut exclusively on Netflix in 2013, plus a  second season of “Lilyhammer,” which debuted on Netflix last February.           8    On February 1st, we’ll release in all of our markets the entire first season (13 episodes) of David  Fincher’s “House of Cards” starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright.  The first few episodes are nearly  done and we are delighted with the results.  Typically when one discovers a new show on linear TV they  get the joy of watching a new episode only to have to wait a week or more to see the next one. We are  releasing all the episodes at once because that is the better member experience that comes from  Internet TV.    Later in the spring we will be bringing Netflix members the long-awaited fourth season of “Arrested  Development,” a show that has grown astonishingly in popularity in the six years it has been off-air and  which now has a large global base of fans awaiting season four.  Like our other originals, this will only be  available on Netflix within our markets.     After that comes “Hemlock Grove,” a horror thriller from scare king Eli Roth, starring Famke Janssen,  Dougray Scott and Lili Taylor, then “Orange is the New Black,” a prison dramedy from “Weeds” creator  Jenji Kohan starring Taylor Schilling and Jason Biggs, and lastly, season two of “Lilyhammer”.     If you step back a decade, our first competence as a company was DVD-by-mail.  Next, we figured out  how to succeed in streaming of TV shows and movies.  Then we started expanding internationally, one  market at a time, learning as we grew.   Like our global expansion, we will take our original programming  expansion step by step, getting better along the way.       Embarking on original series has implications from a cash flow standpoint.  Our cash expense for  originals is quite front loaded, compared to the P&L expense on these deals.  We’ll often pay for the  entire 5-10 year license all in the first few years.  Q4 of this year will be the first quarter in which our  originals start to become a material use of cash relative to the P&L.  More on this topic below in the FCF  section.   Improving Streaming Member Experience    Our better member experience is key to staying ahead of the competition, and increasing consumer  engagement. When most companies grow, they see their engagement metrics drop, while we see the  opposite, with hours viewed per member continuing to climb despite our already large scale. Crucial to  driving hours viewed are the efforts of our product teams, who during the quarter launched several  improvements to the Netflix experience.    A key thing that sets Netflix apart is our algorithms for personalization, which help members find  content they will enjoy, and lead to increased viewing for any given set of content.  Compared to  simplistic “most popular” merchandising, our algorithms add much enjoyment to our members’  experience.  We continue to A/B test new algorithms, and our rate of learning is faster than any  competitor because we have a larger membership from which to learn.          9    On the visual side, this quarter we launched a new and improved UI for smart phones (both iPhone and  Android), which allows for richer content browsing on devices. In addition, we launched our first multi- device experience: smartphones (both Android and iPhones) can now be used to control the Netflix TV  experience via the PS3.  As this interaction model becomes more common among our members, we’ll  improve the experience to match the need, adding more functionality and expanding the device reach.     To increase consumer engagement, we launched an improved post-play experience on the website and  the PS3 (with other devices to follow soon), which makes it even easier to play subsequent episodes and  offer relevant suggestions at the end of movies.    As a sign of our achievements in the area of product development and the technical advancement of  television, we were delighted to receive this month our first Emmy from the Academy of Television Arts  and Sciences for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development.  DVD    DVD subscriptions declined this quarter to 8.6 million, at the better end of our guidance range. Over  two-thirds of these DVD members also subscribe to our streaming service.  We expect DVD subscriptions  to continue their decline but we’re pleased the decline slowed in Q3.  DVD is a great reference format,  and we carry nearly every DVD ever published.  We continue to see minimal service-related impacts  from the first round of USPS processing center reductions that took effect in the first week of July.     The domestic DVD segment delivered $131 million of contribution profit in Q3, representing a 48%  contribution margin, higher than the 46% margin in Q1 and Q2 due to a lower rev share mix this quarter.   We anticipate contribution margin will be up slightly in Q4, and then down sequentially from Q4 to Q1  as usage increases in Q1 and the expected USPS rate increases take effect in January.      Global Profitability:  Q3 Results & Q4 Outlook     We remained profitable this quarter with $8 million of net income, and $0.13 EPS. Compared to Q2, net  income was essentially flat, as increased domestic streaming contribution profit (up $8 million) more  than offset a $3 million decline of DVD contribution profit, a $3 million increase in international losses,  and a $2 million increase in global operating expenses.       Our combined U.S. business remains strong. Excluding international contribution losses, we will  generate over $400 million of operating income this year after covering global operating expenses.  As  expected, in Q4, we will likely move to a consolidated loss because of our initial launch investment in  the Nordics.         10    Free Cash Flow & Content Commitments    In Q3, as expected, negative free cash flow of $20 million trailed net income of $8 million, and we ended  the quarter with $798 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Significant uses of  cash in the quarter (relative to net income) were cash payments for content (in excess of the P&L  expense), cash payments for PP&E (including cache boxes for our Open Connect program), and  reductions in miscellaneous accounts payable and accrued expenses.    As we’ve highlighted, our movement into original programming will require more up-front cash  payments than our typical content licensing agreements, beginning in Q4 and increasing in 2013. So, due  to initial cash payments for originals, in addition to other cash payments for content in excess of P&L  expense, we anticipate negative FCF for several quarters.  We have enough cash on hand to fund our  planned originals in addition to our ongoing expenses, maintain an adequate reserve, and then return to  positive FCF.  We believe the investment in originals is wise, and we will evaluate the performance of  the slate next year to determine at what level we should fund additional originals.      We have invested heavily over the past two years in building our global content library, and as a result,  the corresponding contractual obligations have ramped significantly. While we are still adding new  shows and movies to the service every quarter, and our engagement is growing, our content obligations  have stabilized. In particular, our total streaming commitments at the end of Q3 were flat sequentially at  $5.0 billion, with $2.1 billion due within the next 12 months. Of note, our content licenses and  corresponding obligations are our major cost of revenues. And, as we point out each time we reference  obligations, the $5.0 billion represents the known minimum obligation amounts, but does not include  obligations that we cannot quantify but could be significant.           11       Business Outlook        Summary    We believe Internet TV will grow for the next few decades, and that some firms will build extremely  valuable businesses providing consumers an incredible, personalized Internet TV experience.     Society has had over 50 years of linear TV dominance where channel owners decide what and when  people can enjoy content.  With Internet TV, consumers get power, control and convenience. They can  decide what, when, and where they want to watch. They can pause and resume anytime.  They can  enjoy content on a broad range of amazing devices.     Internet TV is the future of television, and we are leading the change.

      "The global opportunity for streaming TV shows and movies becomes more compelling every year with the rise of smart TVs and faster broadband. With our streaming growth, Netflix is leading the development of Internet TV. Members enjoyed over 2 billion hours of Netflix streaming video in Q4, which is approximately 30 hours per member per month on average. Every quarter we are improving our content selection, we are improving our user experience, we are learning more about social, and we are increasing our brand awareness in the 47 countries where we offer our Internet TV network. 1    2  Domestic Streaming  Q4 Results  Domestically, we grew faster than expected in streaming members (up 220k to 21.67 million) in Q4.  October and November member trends were consistent with our expectations from our last earnings  call, while in December, we not only returned to strongly positive net streaming additions (aided by  strong seasonal gross adds) but exceeded our forecast.  In particular, we saw fewer streaming  cancellations, as well as lower migration to DVD-only plans, resulting in the outperformance for  streaming members.    The domestic streaming segment delivered $52 million of contribution profit, or 10.9% contribution  margin. We exceeded our domestic streaming contribution margin target of around 8% due to higher  than expected streaming members and revenue, as well as some under-spending in both content and  marketing.    Outlook   We are encouraged by the strength in acquisition that we are seeing, coupled with continued  improvements in retention among our domestic streaming members. For Q1 to date, our domestic net  additions for streaming are tracking close to our net additions in Q1 2010 of 1.7 million net additions.   Given this trend, we are comfortable with our ability to continue to expand our domestic streaming  contribution margin.   Since we significantly out-performed our 8% domestic streaming contribution margin target in Q4, we  are increasing our Q1 contribution margin target to approximately 11%. Then, consistent with our  previous guidance, we expect to increase the domestic streaming contribution margin throughout the  year to deliver a trend of margin expansion that averages 100 bps per quarter.  We will continue to  increase our content spending sequentially every quarter, but not at the year-over-year rate expected in  Q1 (more than doubling).    Domestic Content Library  As a result of the significant investments in our streaming library throughout 2011, our current domestic  offering is dramatically improved from a year ago. We have a material increase in the quantity and  quality of the content to show for our increased spending – most notably across on-air TV, kids TV and  library TV. While our 2012 domestic streaming content commitments are already substantially in place,  that doesn’t mean our offering will be static in the coming months. The relationships we’ve established  with all major producers of film and TV in the U.S., including multiple output arrangements, ensure a  steady flow of new titles to the service.  The remaining Starz titles will come off our domestic service at the end of February.  Since the Sony  output came off in Q2 2011, the remaining Starz content is primarily the Encore catalog titles and the 15  current Disney Pay 1 titles.  For the Encore catalog titles, we have plenty of substitutes and in many      3  cases have already directly relicensed from the studios some of the top performing Encore titles. So, the  only significant loss is the current 15 Disney output titles, such as “Toy Story 3” and “Tangled,” which  currently constitute about 2% of our domestic viewing.      Throughout 2012, Paramount will provide us (through our EPIX deal) with such successful family fare as  “The Adventures of Tin Tin,” “Rango” and “Hugo,” which, with 11 Oscar nominations including Best  Picture, is one of the most acclaimed movies of the year.  And in 2013, when our DreamWorks  Animation output deal comes online, we’ll strengthen our long-term, stable flow of great animated  family film titles.    More generally, the Pay 1 titles from our other output deals will increase in the coming months as EPIX,  Relativity, Film District, Open Road and others provide Netflix with films that have already tallied more  than $1.3 billion in domestic box office, including “Thor,” “Transformers 3,” “Captain America,” “Super  8,” “The Immortals” and “Footloose.”  Last quarter, we explained that the evolution of video streaming services to a large extent reflects the  legacy of television networks: namely, historical reliance upon exclusive content as a differentiator.  Consistent with this practice, we are increasingly licensing content on an exclusive basis.     Domestic Streaming Competition  We compete for viewing time with a very wide range of providers.  As other viewing solutions for TV  shows and movies get better, we will face increased competition and potential decreased viewing share.  On the other hand, if our service improves faster than others, we will increase our viewing share.   One class of competitors is the other over-the-top pure plays such as Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime.   We  expect Amazon to continue to offer their video service as a free extra with Prime domestically but also  to brand their video subscription offering as a standalone service at a price less than ours.  Both Amazon  and Hulu Plus’s content is a fraction of our content, and we believe their respective total viewing hours  are each less than 10% of ours.   In the case of Hulu Plus, subscribers have to pay for the service ($7.99)  and still watch commercials (unlike, commercial-free Netflix).  Even if Hulu could afford our level of  content spend, at the same price consumers would prefer commercial-free Netflix over commercial- interrupted Hulu Plus.    As we’ve often said, we see the biggest long term threat as TV Everywhere, and in particular, HBO GO,  the leading implementation of TV Everywhere to date.   HBO has some great content, particularly their  original series, but today for most people it is locked behind a linear interface, or at best, behind a DVR  interface and in all cases tethered to a linear subscription plan.   As HBO GO grows and becomes the  primary way that consumers experience HBO, it will become a much more effective competitor for  viewing time.  Similarly, Showtime’s TV Everywhere application is very impressive and just starting to  gain traction.  Every major network is investing in their Internet application, on tablets, smart TVs,  phones, game consoles, and laptops.  Pricing is simple: the consumer just authenticates with their MVPD  provider.   Over the next few years, UIs will evolve in astounding ways, such as allowing viewers to      4  watch eight simultaneous games on ESPN, color coding where the best action is in a given moment or  allowing Olympics fans the ability to control their own slow-motion replays.  A decade from now,  choosing a linear feed from a broadcast grid of 200 channels will seem like using a rotary dial telephone.  Just as broadcast networks have substantially transformed themselves into cable channels over the last  twenty years, both broadcast and cable networks will effectively also become Internet networks like  Netflix.   As a pure-play we have many advantages, however, just as cable did over broadcast.   We are  100% on-demand and highly-personalized.  Our brand is broad, rather than niche, so we can combine  the benefits of multiple channels into one service.   Additionally, our Internet culture enables us to  create and drive social TV, recommendations TV, and other Internet innovations faster than our cable  and broadcast network competitors.     As cable networks developed, they were able to both compete with broadcast networks, and to bolster  broadcast networks economics through syndication.   Today it is accepted practice for networks to  license parts of their content to other networks, if they get paid well enough.   That is the world of  content licensing in which we live.   In that sense, we are just another network competing for viewing  time with, and licensing content from, other networks.   VPPA Update  In 46 of the 47 countries we serve, members can currently enjoy automatic seamless video sharing  between friends on Facebook, in the same manner that they can choose to enjoy automatic seamless  sharing between friends of their music listening and news story viewing.    As we’ve highlighted before, under a U.S. law enacted in the 1980s, companies that rent or sell physical  video tapes or DVDs are subject to particular privacy rules.   This law, the Video Privacy Protection Act,  or VPPA, creates confusion over our ability to allow U.S. members to choose to automatically share their  viewing history with their friends.   A broad bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House recognized  the benefits of modernizing and simplifying this law and passed H.R. 2471, an amendment to the VPPA  that clarifies the ability of consumers to elect to share their viewing history on an ongoing basis if they  so wish.   Now this proposed amendment is with the Senate, and they have scheduled a hearing on the  VPPA for next week.    International Streaming  In our 5th quarter since launching international operations, we reached 1.9 million international  streaming members in Q4.   Canada  In Canada in Q4, we enhanced our offering with fresh movies and TV shows from existing output deals,  as well as new deals. For TV, we’ve significantly improved our television catalog with new content from  FOX, Sony, and AMC and for film, we have continued to add Pay 1 film titles such as “Black Swan,” “True  Grit,” “The Chronicles of Narnia” and “Rango,” as well as great catalog titles like “Pulp Fiction.” The      5  addition of lots of compelling new shows and movies both drove increased hours viewed per member  and member acquisition during the quarter.   The market opportunity in Canada is exciting enough that we continue to invest in the content library,  meaning that we’ll run at roughly break even for two quarters, and we expect to return to a positive  contribution profit starting in Q3 of this year, two years after our initial launch.  Our plan after that is to  grow our contribution margin as we continue to grow our membership.     Latin America  In Latin America, we ended the year with about the same number of members as we had in Canada at  the same time post-launch last year.  Latin America has about 4x more broadband households than  Canada; so, our focus is on capturing a larger portion of the market opportunity.  Latin America presents unique challenges relative to our other markets; namely, low device penetration,  high piracy, varying preferences for subtitles, and relatively low credit card usage for ecommerce. We  are quickly learning what content works best in the region, and are adjusting our content library  accordingly. We have already nearly doubled our content library since launch, adding considerably more  U.S. and local movies and TV.  We are rapidly increasing the accessibility of our service by adding more  subtitles in both Spanish and Portuguese (in addition to dubs), as well as expanding the range of Netflix  enabled devices in the region. Finally, as expected upon launch, we’ve found that processing  ecommerce consumer payments is quite challenging as compared with North America and Europe. To  overcome this challenge, we are working with our local payment partners to optimize our systems,  exploring adding new payment methods and testing various trial campaigns to improve conversion.   We are committed to the region over the long-term, encouraged by the prospect of building a large,  profitable business over time, just as DIRECTV has done.   UK and Ireland  Our UK and Ireland launch at the beginning of the month was very successful, and we’re seeing faster  member growth than we did when we launched Canada.   As our membership in the UK and Ireland  grows, we’ll be able to invest more and more in content.  We have a great selection of new films from  Lionsgate and others, and will have on our service such highly-anticipated films as “Hunger Games” and  “The Hobbit”, in addition to catalog movies from 5 of the 6 major studios.  On the TV side, we have  current Hollywood TV from the major networks and three key local channels.    In the UK and Ireland we launched with our best Facebook implementation to date.  The positive social  effects get stronger as the number of connected members rises, so we are working hard on making  connecting very easy, and the connected experience very enjoyable.  Just as in the U.S. where our primary long-term competition will likely be TV Everywhere, in the UK our  long-term competition will likely be Sky Go offering Sky Movies and Sky Atlantic on-demand.  (Sky  Atlantic is mostly HBO Originals content, and Sky Movies is one channel with the Pay 1 movie output  from all six major U.S. movie studios).  We believe we will compete very effectively against Sky Go, given      6  our advantages of being an unbundled low-priced offering with broad content that is purely on-demand,  and personalized. Over the coming years, we hope to be able to grow large enough to outbid Sky for one  or more major studio output deals, as we did this year for MGM.    Finally, in the UK, but not in Ireland, we also have the “free” BBC iPlayer and Amazon’s LOVEFiLM as  competitors for viewing time.  LOVEFiLM is primarily a DVD-by-mail service with 2 million DVD  subscribers in the UK, Germany and the Nordics.  iPlayer is an excellent over-the-top last few days catch- up service, free for UK residents.   Total International Results & Outlook    In Q4, international revenue of $29 million was in-line with expectations, while contribution loss of $60  million was slightly better due to lower content expenses.  In Q1, the combined investments in both Latin America and the UK and Ireland will result in a total  international contribution loss of between $108 and $118 million. In future quarters, we intend to  continue to increase our investment in the content libraries in each market, just as we have done in  Canada since launch. Doing so improves the consumer experience, builds strong word of mouth and  positive brand awareness, and drives additional acquisition, all elements of a strong foundation for long- term success. As we improve the service, we grow membership and thus we expect the quarterly  international losses to moderate slightly.   DVD  Q4 Results  As expected, DVD members declined this quarter to 11.2 million due to the continued impact of the  price changes, as hybrid members continued to predominantly choose a streaming-only plan over a  higher priced hybrid plan.  Both hybrid cancellation and migration to streaming-only plans ebbed  through the quarter. We added over 600k unique domestic members in Q4, ending the quarter with  24.4 million.   The domestic DVD segment delivered $194 million of contribution profit in Q4, representing a 52.4%  contribution margin.  The slight out-performance relative to our guidance was predominantly  attributable to a higher ASP than forecasted due to more DVD members staying on 2+ disc plans.    Outlook  While DVD members declined sharply over the last two quarters, the weekly rate of DVD cancellations  has subsided from peak levels in September. Looking out across 2012, we expect continued attrition  among our DVD members. Specifically, in Q1, we expect net losses of DVD members of approximately  1.5 million, with the sequential decline moderating in future quarters.   The DVD business model is predominantly variable cost based. So, as the size of the market opportunity  continues to decline, we expect healthy contribution profit margins to be maintained. Meanwhile, for      7  customers with DVD needs (namely, completeness, simplicity, and with limited broadband), our product  is priced 20% lower than our nearest competitor, and our service remains better and faster.  Earlier this month, Warner Home Entertainment announced it was moving the availability date for rental  DVDs to kiosk and all subscription by mail services to 56 days post the release date for retail sale. This  followed its move to impose a 28 day delay on store based rentals. While we didn’t like the new release  date schemes, we decided that it was better for our members for us to maintain a direct relationship  with Warner under the selling terms it has imposed. The alternative was to secure discs through  multiple retail and third party channels, which can be unreliable and may have added to the time it  takes to procure enough DVDs to meet member demand. We suspect there will be increasingly  differentiated dates as the studios re-configure their shrinking packaged goods businesses.  Product Improvement  Constantly improving our service is key to satisfying current members and attracting new ones. The  better we make the Netflix experience, the more hours are watched, translating into increased retention  and strong word of mouth referral.  In Q4, we announced several product enhancements to that end.    We improved the Netflix experience on the Xbox 360, launching a user interface (UI) that is compatible  with Kinect, allowing members to navigate the Netflix UI with voice and gesture.  The new Xbox app  makes substantial improvements in the streaming experience, reducing the amount of re-buffering,  accelerating start-up, and delivering higher quality streams. We introduced a new UI for the iPad,  making it easier and quicker for members to find what to watch, and we expanded our presence on  tablets as a launch partner of both Amazon’s Kindle Fire and the Barnes & Noble NOOK Tablet.     Following our well-received launch of the “Just for Kids” feature in July, we rolled out the feature to the  Nintendo Wii. Additionally, we made updates to the Netflix app for Android which improved the user  experience and increased the breadth of Android devices supported.  Finally, we had several  personalization algorithm breakthroughs for how we sort titles in each category, making it easier for our  members to find movies and TV shows they’ll love.      Original Programming    Our first Netflix original series, \"Lilyhammer,\" a fish-out-of-water story set in Norway and starring \"The  Sopranos\" mainstay and E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt, will debut on our service on February  6th in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.  All eight first season episodes of \"Lilyhammer\" will be  available at once, so Netflix members can enjoy the first season as quickly as they like, instead of having  to wait a week for each new episode as they would with linear programming.    More Netflix original series are planned for 2012 and 2013, including House of Cards (Q4 2012), and an  exclusive and original fourth season of Arrested Development (2013). Our spending on original  programming is intended to allow us to test a new licensing model using a small portion of our content      8  budget. If “Lilyhammer” or “House of Cards” is popular enough on Netflix so that the fees we’ve paid for  each are in-line with that of other equally-popular content on Netflix during the same time period, we’ll  consider them a success.   Global Profitability: Q4 Results & Outlook  Q4 net income of $41 million, and $0.73 per share, exceeded our expectations, predominantly driven by  the out-performance of domestic streaming contribution profit discussed above.  In general, member growth or contraction in a quarter effects revenue the following quarter more than  the quarter of the change.   The sharp decline in DVD members in Q4 means that in Q1 our DVD revenue  will decline by about as much as our streaming revenue will increase, resulting in approximately flat  sequential revenue in Q1.     Due to the increased investment in international, in particular the launch of the UK, our current outlook  is for a consolidated loss of between $9 and $27 million in Q1. While contribution profit from domestic  streaming will grow sequentially, it will not be sufficient to offset the sequential decline in DVD profits  (~$50 million), and the sequential increase in our international losses (~$50 million), as well as cover our  global G&A and Technology & Development costs.   As a result, we expect modest quarterly losses, as well as losses for the calendar year. Until we achieve  our goal of returning to global profitability, we do not intend to launch additional international markets.    Q4 Free Cash Flow   In Q4, FCF of $34 million slightly trailed net income of $41 million. Significant sources of cash flow in the  quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation and an increase in accounts payable  related to timing of marketing payments. These sources of cash were more than offset by cash  payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense), a decline in deferred revenue and an interest  payment on our notes.   In the quarter, we continued to add to our domestic and international content libraries. For the full year  2011, we added $2.3 billion of streaming content library assets (or, $1.6 billion net of amortization  expense) to our balance sheet. Since we have been generally successful in matching payment terms with  the expense, the growth in streaming content assets also coincided with an increase in our content  related liabilities of $1.5 billion, representing payment obligations under our content licenses not yet  due.    As we add original content in the last quarter of this year, we expect payments for originals to weigh on  FCF as they typically require more up-front payments than non-original content license payment terms.       9    Q4 Financing  Our standard practice with regard to managing our capital structure has been to evaluate on an on- going basis the appropriate cash level and capital structure for the business. In Q4, given the pain from  our price changes and the impact to our 2012 outlook, this analysis led us to the decision to strengthen  our balance sheet by raising $400 million of additional capital from two long-term oriented  shareholders. $200 million was raised through the sale of equity (2.86 million shares at $70 per share),  and $200 million was raised through the private placement of zero-coupon convertible notes.  We have  no intentions to spend this additional capital; it is merely a stronger safety-net for an aggressive, fast  moving business with a big opportunity.    After the financing, we finished the quarter with $798 million in cash and equivalents.   Metrics evolution  As stated in our January 2011 investor letter, net additions, along with revenue and contribution profit,  are our core performance measurements for each of our segments.  This is the final letter in which we  will provide gross additions, churn and SAC in our domestic results, conforming to how we have been  reporting our international streaming results.  Starting this quarter, we will be also providing guidance for paid members, in addition to our traditional  guidance for total members. Since paid membership drives revenue and profit, we believe a focus on  this metric is most relevant for our financial discussions. We will continue to report free, paid, and total  subscribers by segment.      As we evolve our focus from DVD to streaming, we are slightly updating our definition of membership  starting with this quarter’s membership guidance. Members who are on payment hold will no longer be  counted as members, while members who cancel mid-period will be counted until their service ceases at  the end of the period. We estimate the net effect of these changes will be less than 200k fewer  domestic streaming members than we would otherwise report in Q1. There is no effect on revenue from  this change.      10    CEO Stock Sales  Reed has some 10-year options expiring in Q1, and will be making a one-time sale of those shares as  part of a 10b5-1 plan, but is otherwise not selling stock this quarter.    CMO Search  As we announced last week, we’re looking for a CMO who today probably runs marketing at a cable  network or a mobile phone network, and has strong global experience.  Typically these searches take 4-6  months.  In the meantime, our long time executive Jessie Becker is our Interim CMO, and is a candidate  for the role also.   Leslie Kilgore made huge contributions over the last 12 years to nearly every part of  our business, and we’re very happy to have her join our Board of Directors to continue to help Netflix  prosper.

      "Q4 capped a tremendous year for Netflix as Internet TV becomes an ever-growing part of people’s lives:  we added nearly 10 million global streaming members in 2012,  we grew to over 33 million global streaming members,  we generated profits for the year 2012, despite large international investments establishing Netflix in 40 countries around the world, and  we developed several major original series, which debut this year. Our summary results for Q4 2012 follow: (in millions except per share data) Q4 '11 Q1 '12 Q2 '12 Q3 '12 Q4 '12 Domestic Streaming: Net Subscription Additions 0.22 1.74 0.53 1.16 2.05 Total Subscriptions 21.67 23.41 23.94 25.10 27.15 Paid Subscriptions 20.15 22.02 22.69 23.80 25.47 Revenue $ 476 $ 507 $ 533 $ 556 $ 589 Contribution Profit $ 52 $ 67 $ 83 $ 91 $ 109 Contribution Margin 10.9 % 13.2 % 15.6 % 16.4 % 18.5 % International Streaming: Net Subscription Additions 0.38 1.21 0.56 0.69 1.81 Total Subscriptions 1.86 3.07 3.62 4.31 6.12 Paid Subscriptions 1.45 2.41 3.02 3.69 4.89 Revenue $ 29 $ 43 $ 65 $ 78 $ 101 Contribution Profit (Loss) $ (60 ) $ (103 ) $ (89 ) $ (92 ) $ (105 ) Domestic DVD: Net Subscription Additions (2.76 ) (1.08 ) (0.85 ) (0.63 ) (0.38 ) Total Subscriptions 11.17 10.09 9.24 8.61 8.22 Paid Subscriptions 11.04 9.96 9.15 8.47 8.05 Revenue $ 370 $ 320 $ 291 $ 271 $ 254 Contribution Profit $ 194 $ 146 $ 134 $ 131 $ 128 Contribution Margin 52.4 % 45.6 % 46.0 % 48.2 % 50.1 % Global: Revenue $ 876 $ 870 $ 889 $ 905 $ 945 Net Income (Loss) $ 35 $ (5 ) $ 6 $ 8 $ 8 EPS $ 0.64 $ (0.08 ) $ 0.11 $ 0.13 $ 0.13 Free Cash Flow $ 34 $ 2 $ 11 $ (20 ) $ (51 ) Shares (FD) 55.4 55.5 58.8 58.7 59.1 1Domestic Streaming We added more than 2 million members in Q4 to end the year with over 27 million domestic members. Our holiday season was particularly strong, driven by consumers buying new electronic devices, including tablets and smart TVs. Both voluntary and involuntary retention improved in Q4. The increase in involuntary retention was due to improvements in how we process payments and recover those members on payment hold. We believe the gains in voluntary retention stemmed from steady improvements in service and content relative to the broad array of video choices available to consumers, as shown by the continued growth in our median hours viewed per member. Contribution margin continued to climb in Q4, expanding sequentially 210 basis points to 18.5%. Our outperformance relative to our target of 100 basis points of margin expansion per quarter was driven by higher than forecasted members and revenue and lower than forecasted content delivery costs. Starting this quarter, you’ll see that we expanded our segment disclosures to break out marketing and cost of revenues. We’ve been investing in making our service better with increased spending on content, which helps both retain and attract members, and have been able to trim marketing spending yet maintain strong net additions. Our target remains to expand contribution margin on average about 100 basis points per quarter. We anticipate domestic streaming contribution profit will, for the first time ever, be larger than DVD contribution profit (and up about 90% year over year) in Q1. Regarding domestic streaming content, we announced in Q4 that we will be the exclusive “Pay 1” home for theatrical releases from the Walt Disney Studio starting in 2016. While we’ve done similar major studio Pay 1 deals before (e.g. Paramount in Canada, Warner Bros. in the Nordics, and Lionsgate in the U.K. and Ireland), and will do more in the future, the Disney deal is particularly significant because it is our first Pay 1 deal with a major studio in the U.S. and because of the strength of the Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm titles. 2016 is a long way off, and in the meantime, we are adding lots of other great films and TV shows, including a wide assortment of family films from the Disney catalog. More recently, we signed a deal with Warner Bros., the largest TV producer in the world, bringing exclusively to Netflix complete previous seasons of popular on-air serialized dramas such as “Revolution” on NBC and “The Following” on Fox. This deal is significant because we are licensing directly from the producer, rather than the networks on which these shows air, allowing us to bring previous seasons to Netflix earlier than traditional network deals have accommodated. This type of license agreement plays right to our sweet spot. When it comes to highly serialized TV series, Netflix 2offers an amazingly better experience than any other alternative as members can start right from season one, episode one and watch episodes how and when they feel like it. In terms of domestic competition, TV Everywhere, including HBO GO, continues to improve, and linear TV distributors clearly see the benefit of offering Internet TV. This competition for viewing time will increase over the next several years, as we have long predicted, as consumers come to expect Internet TV on demand viewing for all their video entertainment. More narrowly, Amazon Prime, Redbox Instant, and Hulu also offer low-cost streaming offerings, and they have some of the same content that Netflix has, as well as some unique content. The more unique content they have (for example, “Battleground” and “Community” on Hulu, or “Falling Skies” and “The Closer” on Amazon Prime), the more they are a different service than ours. To the degree they have some of the same content as Netflix, they are potentially a substitute for Netflix. To examine this, we looked at the top 200 titles on Netflix: our 100 most popular movies and our 100 most popular TV shows in Q4. Of these 200, 113 are not on Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus or Redbox Instant. Of the 87 that are available on at least one of these services, Hulu Plus offers 27 of the 200; Amazon Prime 73 of the 200; and Redbox Instant 12 of the 200, with significant overlap in TV between Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime, and in movies between Amazon Prime and Redbox Instant. In other words, when it comes to the most popular content with members on Netflix, none of these services are good substitutes to Netflix. 3Like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu are moving towards increasing exclusives and original series, and over time as a group we are likely to compete more like Showtime and HBO do today. In the U.K. this is already the case: Sky NOW TV, LOVEFiLM, and Netflix have very limited overlapping content. The same holds true in the Nordics among the various services. In such a world, our originals will be a great asset. When it comes to competition, we not only have a superior content offering due to our larger budget, but we are further along the experience curve when it comes to improving our user interface and delivering great quality streaming. For all of these reasons, Netflix continues to add members rapidly. Earlier this year, the Video Privacy Protection Act, or VPPA, was modernized and now allows U.S. members to share what they are watching on Netflix with their friends on an ongoing basis. Our members will now be able to choose to have “friends rows” within the Netflix user interface for friends they have agreed to share viewing with. Our default settings will not auto-post to Facebook timeline, but members will be able to post to Facebook specific titles they are passionate about. We are excited to roll these features out in the U.S. in the next few months. Looking forward, we expect this year’s Q1 net additions to be slightly higher than last year’s Q1 net additions of 1.7 million. The fact that our growth remains this strong despite intensifying competition, and our already substantial U.S. market penetration, underlines the large opportunity ahead. As a reminder, we detailed in our April 2012 Investor Letter how unchanged seasonality of gross adds would, due to the larger size of our existing subscriber base, result in increased seasonality of net additions. Thus we would expect fewer net additions in Q2 2013 than in Q2 2012, because Q2 is our seasonally lightest quarter. That said, we anticipate the fourth season of “Arrested Development” to debut in Q2, and that could bring us higher than otherwise expected membership. International During the quarter, we grew to over 6 million international members, as people around the world discover the benefits of Netflix. Our total international contribution loss of $105 million in Q4 was, as expected, higher than the prior quarter international loss of $92 million, owing to the incremental costs associated with our launch in the Nordic countries. The Q4 loss was lower, however, than our guidance midpoint of a $113 million loss, due primarily to the higher than expected growth of international subscriptions and revenue. Over the course of this year, we expect to see declining losses in our current international markets as member growth exceeds growth in content spending. With a Q1 guidance midpoint of $87 million in international losses, we expect a sequential improvement of $18 million, with more modest sequential improvements expected in subsequent quarters. 4                       5      For the first half of 2013, we aren’t planning to launch additional international markets. We are  evaluating several expansion markets for late 2013 or 2014, but have not made any decisions yet. Our  launch in the Nordics was very successful, confirming our belief in the large international opportunity for  our service.    In Latin America, we’ve made steady progress on our consumer payment infrastructure.  In Brazil, we’ve  recently launched a direct debit consumer payment option with several major banks (“Débito  Automático”) and are testing the uniquely Brazilian form of payments known as Boleto Bancário. In  Mexico, we’ve made progress in enabling debit cards for Netflix which has to be done in some cases  bank-by-bank. Over 50 million households pay for residential broadband in Latin America, over half the  U.S. number, so this region is a massive opportunity for us.    In Q4, the 2012 hit film “The Hunger Games” debuted on our Canadian service, with much success, just  as it had a few months prior on our Latin America service.  In Q1, it will debut on our U.K. and Ireland  services, followed by the U.S. The multi-territorial success of “The Hunger Games” on Netflix shows the  value that an international programming platform like Netflix offers content brands, and underlines how  such broad international reach remains unique.    In addition to competition from local broadcasters and distributors with TV Everywhere-type products,  and from piracy, we face many pure-play competitors around the world, including Clarovideo, Sky NOW  TV, HBO Nordics, Amazon LOVEFiLM, Viaplay, and others.  Our estimates from Internet data flows and  other sources suggest we lead all of them in both viewing and revenue. We have a large and growing  membership base to invest against, and our R&D effort is more substantial than our competitors,  allowing us to provide a better and faster-evolving user experience that gives members the ability to  find great series and films to watch, no matter the territory.    Given this heightened competition, we’ll say a little less about country by country results than in the  past, to avoid inadvertently helping our competitors.  Long-term international success for Netflix is  consumer adoption and contribution margins at the levels of our domestic market.  Progress towards  that can be seen quarterly in our growing international membership and declining international losses.    Original Series    We believe that February 1st will be a defining moment in the development of Internet TV.     On that day, we will release all 13 episodes of “House of Cards” in all of our markets, allowing our  members the freedom to immerse themselves when and how they want in the world created by David  Fincher and his stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright.                           6      Imagine if books were always released one chapter per week, and were only briefly available to read at  8pm on Thursday.  And then someone flipped a switch, suddenly allowing people to enjoy an entire  book, all at their own pace. That is the change we are bringing about. That is the future of television.   That is Internet TV.     Stepping back, we have three major types of streaming content on Netflix:  1. Movies from one to fifty years old  2. Prior seasons of current TV shows and complete prior season of off-air TV shows  3. Original series only available on Netflix.     The first category, movies, is where we started.  Then, over the last few years, we’ve greatly expanded  our offering in the second category, prior-season TV, with a particular emphasis on serialized drama.  Such shows were struggling to find a consistent economic return on linear TV, whereas for us they work  great, playing directly into the way that people actually prefer to watch such shows.     Original series are a third type of content to attract and retain members.  Because original series can be  completely exclusive to Netflix (no TVOD, no linear, no kiosks, no theaters) we believe they will be more  effective in attracting and retaining members than equivalent content that is less exclusive to Netflix.       We believe original series developed for Internet TV will be better for creators, better for consumers,  and better for Netflix.  A large on-demand service has fundamental advantages in producing and  launching new series.     Linear channels must aggregate a large audience at a given time of day and hope the show programmed  will actually attract enough viewers despite this constraint.  With Netflix, members can enjoy a show  anytime, and over time, we can effectively put the right show in front of members based on their  viewing habits.  Thus we can spend less on marketing while generating higher viewership.     For linear TV, the fixed number of prime-time slots mean that only shows that hit it big and fast survive,  thus requiring an extensive and expensive pilot system to keep on deck potential replacement shows. In  contrast, Internet TV is an environment where smaller or quirkier shows can prosper because they can  find a big enough audience over time. In baseball terms, linear TV only scores with home runs.  We score  with home runs too, but also with singles, doubles and triples.      Because of our unique strengths, we can commit to producing and publishing “books” rather than  “chapters”, so the creators can concentrate on multi-episode story arcs, rather than pilots.  Creators can  work on episode 11 confident that viewers have recently enjoyed episodes 1 to 10.   Creators can  develop episodes that are not all exactly 22 or 44 minutes in length.  The constraints of the linear TV grid  will fall, one by one.                            7      For viewers, Internet TV is a better experience because of the freedom and flexibility it provides, and in  the case of Netflix, the lack of commercials.  In addition, by releasing our shows on the same day across  all of our markets, we will delight international members, as usually, they have to wait months after a  U.S. premiere to enjoy the same content.      “House of Cards” will be followed by Eli Roth’s “Hemlock Grove” (a horror thriller) on April 19th, the  much anticipated fourth season of “Arrested Development” in May, “Orange is the New Black” (a prison  dramedy from “Weeds” creator Jenji Kohan), “Derek” with Ricky Gervais, and lastly this year, season two  of “Lilyhammer.”    If we are successful with our originals, we will produce content with comparable cost per viewing hour  to other exclusive premium content. Success with originals will also enhance the global reputation of  Netflix as a source of unique must-view content.          While our first slate of originals will represent a small percentage of both our content budget (i.e. P&L  expense) and total viewing hours this year, the cash is front loaded relative to the P&L expense.  In Q4,  our current originals became a material use of cash for the first time.  They are expected to consume  more cash in Q1 and then decrease in terms of cash use in Q2 forward.  More on this topic below in the  FCF section.  Programming Great Content    Our content budget has grown rapidly over the last few years, allowing us to greatly expand the scope of  the Netflix offering. With every title we add to the library, we remain focused on our goal of being an  expert programmer, licensing an overall mix of content that delights our members, rather than trying to  be a very broad content distributor.     A distributor aggregates and provides access to wide swaths of content, but usually on a non-exclusive  and undifferentiated basis.  Comcast and DIRECTV are distributors.    A programmer takes an active role in creating a curated content offering, providing selective and often  exclusive content that is differentiated from other programmers.  HBO and Netflix are programmers.     As a programmer, we seek to offer our members high quality and high engagement premium content  choices. To do so, we have increasingly licensed content on an exclusive basis to ensure our members  are receiving an entertainment experience that cannot be replicated by our competitors.    Coincidently, this means we are selective about what titles we add to the service and what content  agreements we renew. Since we can’t license everything and also maintain low prices, we seek out  content that delivers the highest member engagement relative to its cost. This also means that we’ll                         8      forego or not renew content that doesn’t optimize for engagement and cost efficiency across the  available content choices within the constraints of our budget. This was the case when we did not renew  our Starz agreement in 2011, as well as our A&E / History Channel agreement last year. In all cases, we  use our extensive member viewing data to inform our programming choices to create a unique and  compelling offering that will most delight our members.    As part of our selective programming strategy, we focus not only on major studio output, but also on  providing our members with interesting and compelling independent content. Because of our  merchandising capabilities as well as our massive member base, we enjoy high engagement on what  would otherwise be considered non-mainstream content. For example, we currently stream three of the  2013 Oscar nominated documentary feature films on Netflix: “5 Broken Cameras,” “The Invisible War,”  and “How To Survive a Plague.”  In addition, many of the top independent films of the year can only be  found on Netflix.   Improving Member Streaming Experience    We are focused on creating an experience that delights our members and increases their engagement.  Our large member base allows us to do more and bigger experiments, which enables us to learn what  works best for our members more quickly than our competitors.    We recently launched Netflix on Windows 8 with a great user interface that works for both  mouse/keyboard and touch screen, and we launched Netflix on the Wii U with a second screen  experience for choosing what to watch. We are also pioneering the use of tablets and handsets as  second-screen choosing devices for TV viewing.    As part of the Netflix search experience, we have made it even easier for members to explore our vast  catalog and we'll continue working on improving the algorithms that power our recommendations, as  well as making search more effective for our members.  Another way we’re now leveraging our  recommendations system is to identify the audience most likely to enjoy each Netflix Original from our  diverse upcoming slate.  Unlike linear television that needs to build an audience for the premiere  showing, our tools are designed to maximize the value of each show over the long term.  We’ll learn the  characteristics of the members who love each show and promote to potential viewers with similar traits.    To make our suggestions more useful, we have recently started testing several variations of a personal  profiles feature that creates suggestions for different members of the household based on their own  taste, not confused by the viewing of their kids or others sharing the same subscription.  If this test  succeeds in increasing member engagement, we will roll out profiles more broadly later this year.    Last year, Netflix launched Open Connect to enable ISPs to receive Netflix media data directly, and for  free, at various standard interconnection points or within their own networks.  This is more efficient                         9      than going through intermediaries, and provides consumers with the highest quality picture and least  rebuffering. Most international ISPs and many domestic ISPs already receive their traffic via Open  Connect.  Our newest and best video formats (Super-HD and 3D) that are larger and more challenging to  deliver are only available on Open Connect.  We are working hard to get all ISPs to directly connect for  free to Open Connect to improve their customers’ broadband experience.    DVD    DVD memberships declined less than we had anticipated this quarter to 8.2 million (above the top end  of our guidance range), driven by stronger than forecasted retention.  The decline has slowed in each  quarter since we introduced the DVD-only plan.     The domestic DVD segment delivered $128 million of contribution profit in Q4, representing a 50%  contribution margin, higher than anticipated due to higher members and lower than expected DVD  usage.  We anticipate a decline in DVD contribution margin sequentially from Q4 to Q1 as usage  seasonally increases in Q1 and the expected USPS rate increase of $0.01 each way takes effect in  January.    The US Postal Service is under financial stress, but we don’t foresee service changes this year that have a  material negative impact upon us or our members.    Global Profitability:  Q4 Results & Q1 Outlook    Consolidated Q4 net income of $8 million ($0.13 EPS) exceeded our guidance due to contribution profit  out-performance primarily in our domestic and international streaming segments. Net income was flat  quarter over quarter, as increased domestic streaming contribution profit (up $18 million) more than  offset a $3 million decline of DVD contribution profit, and a $12 million increase in international losses  (driven by the launch of the Nordics market), while global operating expenses were flat sequentially.     We anticipate net income will be relatively flat quarter over quarter in Q1, as improvements in both  domestic and international streaming profits will be offset by a decline in DVD contribution profit and  increases in global operating expenses.  Free Cash Flow & Capital    In Q4, the gap between free cash flow (negative $51 million) and net income (positive $8 million)  widened as a result of payments for the original programs coming to Netflix in 2013. Significant uses of  cash in the quarter (relative to net income) were cash payments for both originals and non-originals                         10      content (in excess of the P&L expense), cash payments for PP&E (related to the continued rollout of our  Open Connect servers), and tax payments.    In the past, we have managed our content licensing agreements such that cash payments in any quarter  do not exceed 110% of the P&L expense (in other words, if our P&L expense was $200 million in the  quarter, our cash payments for content would not exceed $220 million in the quarter).  As we shared on  our last earnings call, our original programming will require more up-front cash payments than most  other content licensing agreements, raising this ratio (of cash to P&L for content) to as high as 120% in  certain quarters with material originals payments. The bulk of our remaining cash payments for our  current originals will be in Q1, driving FCF materially more negative than Q4, and then FCF will improve  substantially in subsequent quarters.    As highlighted previously, we have sufficient cash on hand to fund our current slate of originals and  ongoing expenses, and to maintain an adequate reserve, before returning to positive FCF.    In addition, we are exploring taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment to refinance  our $200 million in outstanding notes and raise additional cash through new debt financing.  This would  give us additional reserves as well as increased flexibility to fund future originals.  Miscellaneous    For management purposes, we look at the relatively modest overhead expenses (mostly personnel) in  our global content acquisition group as part of G&A, and as such we don’t allocate them across our  three business segments.  For our global marketing team, however, the also relatively modest overhead  costs were historically allocated entirely to just the domestic streaming segment.  Starting in Q1,  marketing overhead will be part of G&A, consistent with how we treat content overhead, and will not be  allocated to the domestic streaming segment.  This is about $5 million of expense in Q1, so the change  will slightly increase domestic streaming contribution profit, and slightly increase global operating  expense by the same amount.  There is no change to operating income, net income, cash flows, or any  other global metric.     Starting in July, Reed has some 10-year employee options expiring every month, and he plans to sell  upon forced-exercise.  He has no other sales planned.    Carl Icahn became a 10% investor last quarter at approximately $58 per share.  We have no further  news about his intentions, but have had constructive conversations with him about building a more  valuable company.                                 11      Business Outlook      Summary    Netflix offers consumers what they want -- compelling content and control over how and when they  watch it.  We are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the huge opportunity ahead.

      "Investor_Letter_Q12013\n",
      "In Q1, we added over 3 million streaming members, bringing us to more than 36 million, who collectively enjoyed on Netflix over 4 billion hours of films and TV shows. Our summary results for Q1 2013 follow: 1Domestic Streaming Our U.S. streaming business achieved strong growth in Q1. We added over 2 million members to the service, launched to great reception our first Original series of 2013 House of Cards, and improved our streaming contribution margin above our 100 bps target. We added 2.03 million members compared to 2.05 million in the prior quarter and 1.74 million in Q1 a year ago. In terms of comparing our Q1 net additions to last year’s performance, it’s worth reminding everyone of the change we made to our member definition as detailed in the January 2012 Investor letter in which we immediately excluded from our member count those members who are on payment hold. This more conservative definition translated into ~300,000 fewer net additions in Q1 2012, so we would have reported about 2 million. Therefore, think of Q1 2013 net adds as roughly comparable to the year ago period, a positive outcome. For many years, as a DVD-based business, Q1 net additions have been larger than the prior quarter net adds, but not this Q1. For DVD, factors such as a robust holiday DVD release slate and publicity for new movies created by the awards season telecasts likely influenced this pattern, boosting Q1 relative to Q4. This Q4 to Q1 pattern appears to be different for our streaming business, and this is our first clean streaming holiday season to show the seasonality. We’ve seen improvements in our business over the last year in content, in our product, in optimizing the way we process payments, and in the general recovery of our brand. All of these improvements contribute to higher member satisfaction, which we see in higher year-over-year levels for members’ likelihood to recommend our service. During the quarter, we continued to grow members and revenue faster than content spending and our domestic streaming contribution margin increased to 20.6% in Q1, a further 140 bps of improvement from Q4 (not including 70 bps resulting from reclassifying marketing overhead)1. On a year-over-year basis, we expanded contribution margin over 600 bps on essentially flat marketing expense. Our target remains to expand contribution margin on average about 100 bps per quarter. We introduced our streaming only plan at $7.99 in 2010. We’ve been adding more content to the service ever since, and are very happy with membership growth at this low price point. In terms of significant U.S. licensing deals, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros. TV group for selected complete previous seasons of popular shows from Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation and Adult Swim, as well as the TNT serialized drama Dallas. We also reached agreement directly with Warner Bros. TV to bring to Netflix members earlier, and more 1 As previewed in our January 2013 Investor letter, starting this quarter, marketing overhead is now part of global G&A (consistent with how we treat content overhead) and is not allocated to the domestic streaming segment. 2exclusively than ever before, complete previous seasons of some of the hottest shows on network and cable TV -- including Revolution (NBC), The Following (Fox), Longmire (A&E), and Political Animals (USA). The deal with Warner Bros. Television is significant because it illustrates our evolution to a curator of select programming. Many of our earliest deals were with networks and cable channels and included some shows that have not proven successful. Those networks and channels are also uniquely leveraged by their cable and satellite partners to hold back for as long as possible the availability of shows while limiting the kind of on-demand exclusivity we favor. By dealing directly with the producers of TV shows, we are better positioned to pick just those shows that we believe will work best and secure rights that may be otherwise blocked by TV carriage and transmission deals. In that same spirit, we’re also thrilled with our unique arrangement with Fox Television Studios to bring a third season of the fan favorite The Killing exclusively to our U.S., Canadian and Latin American members 90 days after the season finale airs on AMC. In the U.K., Ireland and Nordic countries, new episodes will premiere weekly and exclusively on Netflix, just days after the U.S. broadcast. As we continue to focus on exclusive and curated content, our willingness to pay for non-exclusive, bulk content deals declines. At the end of May we’ll be allowing our broad Viacom Networks deal for Nickelodeon, BET, and MTV content to expire. We are in discussions with them about licensing particular shows but have yet to conclude a deal. We continue to do lots of other business with Viacom around the world, such as our exclusive Pay1 deal for Paramount titles in Canada. With all the recently added fresh programming from Disney, Cartoon Network, Hasbro’s The Hub and Dreamworks Animation, we have a great kids offering. As we discussed a quarter ago and in our April 2012 Investor letter appendix, we generally expect Q2 net additions to be lower than prior year Q2 due to increased seasonality of net additions. This coming Q2, however, we have Arrested Development, and momentum from lots of new content coming to the service, so we expect to see slightly higher net additions than Q2 a year ago. Last quarter we shared with you that of our “top 200” titles, Amazon Prime Instant Video had only 73. This quarter it was 74. International Our international membership grew by 1 million during the quarter to a total of 7.1 million, generating 14% of global revenue. During Q4 2012, we added 1.8 million net international members and 1.2 million 3during Q1 20122. The Nordics and the UK/Ireland launch in Q4’12 and Q1’12, respectively, resulted in an elevated level of net additions in those launch quarters as we benefited from the initial growth of a new territory. In all of our markets, we saw growth and improved profits or reduced losses. International contribution losses improved $28 million sequentially, better than expected due primarily to less growth in content spending than forecast. For Q2, we are not forecasting a substantial improvement in contribution losses because we are increasing our international content spending in line with revenue growth. In early Q2, we implemented a modest price increase (15 BRL to 17 BRL) in Brazil, approximately matching local inflation over the last two years. We plan to launch an additional European market during the second half of 2013. We’ll have more to say about this on our July earnings call. Original Series On February 1, we premiered all 13 episodes of House of Cards to enormous popular and critical acclaim. The global viewing and high level of engagement with the show increased our confidence in our ability to pick shows Netflix members will embrace and to pick partners skilled at delivering a great series. The high level of viewer satisfaction implies we are able to target the right audience without the benefit of existing broadcast or cable viewing data and the strong viewing across all our markets gives us faith in our ability to create global content brands in a cost-effective, efficient way. Our decision to launch all episodes at once created enormous media and social buzz, reinforcing our brand attribute of giving consumers complete control over how and when they enjoy their entertainment. Some investors worried that the House of Cards fans would take advantage of our free trial, watch the show, and then cancel. However, there was very little free-trial gaming - less than 8,000 people did this - out of millions of free trials in the quarter. On April 19, we launched all 13 episodes of Hemlock Grove, a horror thriller from Eli Roth and we’re very pleased with its early performance. Hemlock Grove was viewed by more members globally in its first weekend than was House of Cards and has been a particular hit among young adults. Up next is the long-awaited and much-anticipated fourth season of comedy cult favorite Arrested Development, with all 15 episodes available on May 26. 2 The effect from the change to our member definition as discussed in the domestic streaming segment was very small for international (23,000 fewer Q1 2012 international net additions) because we had already excluded members on payment holds in LATAM. 4This summer, we’ll launch Orange Is the New Black, a prison dramedy from Weeds creator Jenji Kohan; Derek, a heartfelt, funny look at life in a senior center from Ricky Gervais; and, later in the year, season two of Lilyhammer. During the quarter, we announced two new Original series coming to Netflix. Turbo: F.A.S.T. (Fast Action Stunt Team), is a collaboration with DreamWorks Animation and our first ever series for kids. It will continue the story of the summer DreamWorks Animation movie Turbo when it premieres on our service in December. Coming to Netflix in late 2014, will be Sense8, a new Sci-Fi thriller from the Wachowski siblings, who created the Matrix Trilogy and Cloud Atlas, and J. Michael Straszynski, creator of the hit TV series Babylon 5. As we’ve said before, our first slate of Originals will represent a small percentage of both our content budget (i.e. P&L expense) and total viewing hours this year, though cash use is front loaded relative to the P&L expense. Long term, we believe the value of our Original series in driving acquisition and retention improvements will be borne out as we add more seasons of already popular shows like House of Cards and further series. Harry Potter was not a phenomenon in book one, compared to later books in the series. Marketing With the broader acceptance of streaming and Internet Television, more of our marketing now focuses on the content we bring to members. The launch of House of Cards provided a halo effect on our entire service and spoke to the quality of experience members can expect from Netflix. In addition to our emphasis on Original series, we are delivering targeted messages as high-profile titles arrive on the service. This marketing strategy is designed to attract new members, excite current members to watch more, and encourage past members to come back. Our media spend is increasingly digital, with a moderate reduction in our use of linear TV advertising. We have seen encouraging results from online video ads and we will continue to find new ways to reach consumers at key stages along their consumer journey from initial awareness to free trial. 5Improving Member Streaming Experience We continue to make the member experience better through AB testing, measuring the impact of our innovation on acquisition, retention, and hours of viewing. During the quarter, we continued to explore new payment vehicles with a focus on Latin America, adding direct debit with a number of banks in the region. Adding direct debit has lowered one of the barriers to membership in the region and is an example of how we generally expand the acquisition funnel, a focal point for our teams. We had a number of wins during the quarter with new algorithmic techniques to match members with content they’ll enjoy, driving more Netflix watching. The launch of House of Cards allowed us to explore new ways to promote significant individual titles to those members who are most inclined to watch without over-promoting to members with different tastes and are pleased with the results. In many households, Netflix is used by different family members, and we tested a “Profiles” feature that separates the activity of each individual. This enables us to offer more relevant personalized suggestions for each individual, and we expect to roll out profiles globally in the coming months. In January, the Video Privacy Protection Act was updated, allowing us to launch social features in the U.S, that we’ve been testing in the rest of the world since late 2011. We expect to see more social discovery of content to watch, supplementing the existing taste-based techniques we have relied upon to date. We’ll continue to test and innovate around social features. We also released the next major version of our Netflix player technology to our consumer electronics partners to include in their Smart TVs and set-top boxes. The new platform emphasizes size and performance improvements, and offers dramatically faster playback startup (aiming to match the time required for a linear channel change). This new platform will appear in a few new devices in time for the holiday season, and will roll out more widely in the spring 2014 refresh for many CE manufacturers. We continue to realize gains (in availability, scalability, and cost savings) from our push to migrate our technology to the cloud, and we recently launched the Netflix Cloud Prize as a way to accelerate evolution of the Netflix Open Source platform. In addition, we are developing and sharing standards, such as HTML5 video standards and encoding format standards, and we are actively working with our studio suppliers to create a more robust supply chain for delivery of content. A few members with large families run into our 2-simultaneous-stream limit. To best serve these members, we’re shortly adding a 4-stream plan, at $11.99 in the U.S., and we expect fewer than 1% of members to take it. 6DVD DVD memberships declined modestly to about 8 million. Combined with lower than expected content costs, higher revenue drove a better-than-expected $113 million contribution profit in Q1, representing a 46.6% contribution margin. The expected sequential decline in DVD contribution margin was due to seasonally higher usage in Q1 and the USPS rate increase of $0.01 each way that took effect in January. Absent USPS rate increases, we’ve been able to maintain our DVD contribution margin as members and shipment volume decline. We anticipate continuing to be able to maintain the margins we see in the first half of 2013 throughout the full year. Consistent with our view last quarter, we don’t foresee USPS service changes that will have a material negative impact upon us or our members for the remainder of 2013. Going forward we’ll continue to provide our full DVD segment level reporting but will only provide guidance on DVD contribution profit since that is what we focus on. Global Profitability: Q1 Results & Q2 Outlook Consolidated Q1 net income was $3 million ($0.05 EPS) and includes a $16 million loss on extinguishment of debt, net of taxes, related to the refinancing of our 8.5% bond in February. Excluding this loss, our net income would have been $19 million ($0.31 EPS), above our guidance because of the outperformance across all three of our operating segments. Net income, excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt, was up sequentially as an $18 million increase in domestic streaming contribution profit and a $28 million decrease in international losses more than offset a $14 million decline of DVD contribution profit and an increase in global operating costs. In Q2, our guidance implies net income roughly flat with Q1 (absent the loss on extinguishment of debt). We had a tax benefit in Q1 related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit that will not repeat in Q2, so higher sequential operating profit will be partially offset by higher sequential taxes. Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow of negative $42 million was $45 million lower than our positive $3 million in net income in the quarter primarily due to payments for Originals and non-originals content in excess of the P&L expense, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of the debt (a financing activity) and non-cash stock compensation expense. The investments that will continue to weigh on our cash flow relative to net income are Originals and non-Originals content (ongoing) and our Open Connect conversion (primarily in 2013). 7Capital In February, we raised $500 million in 8 year 5.375% notes with investment-grade covenants and used approximately $225 million of the proceeds to retire our 2007 8.5% notes. The refinancing of the notes, while being favorable to capital costs in the long term, was the basis for the $25 million pretax, or $16 million net of tax, loss on extinguishment of debt in the quarter. With the fundraising, we finished the quarter with a little over $1 billion in cash and equivalents. Market conditions were attractive and we were pleased to add cash to increase our reserves and afford us the flexibility to invest in additional Originals. We will convert the 2011 TCV $200 million convertible notes tomorrow (April 23rd) into the corresponding 2.3 million shares. We report diluted EPS as if the debt was converted, so our guidance for Q2 EPS already accounts for these shares, and there is no change to our cash on hand from this conversion.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures,  during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make  investments and for certain other activities.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net  income and diluted earnings per share provide useful information as these measures exclude losses that  are not indicative of our core operating results.  However, these non-GAAP measures should be  considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted  earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.      Forward-Looking Statements    This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding our approach to licensing content; member acquisition  seasonality; expansion to additional international markets and international contribution profits (losses);  impact and value of our original content; marketing strategy; improvements in our member experience,  including the rollout of our profiles and social features; conversion of our $200M convertible notes;  business outlook for our DVD segment; free cash flow and usage of cash; member growth, including  total and paid; revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2013.

      "We are happy to report that Q2 was another great quarter for Netflix. Streaming is continuing to grow rapidly, and with the recently introduced price changes, we’ll be able to further increase the scope and quality of our streaming content. At the end of the quarter, Netflix had over 25 million global subscribers, up 70% from 15 million just one year ago. Our summary results are below: 1    2  Domestic Q2 results  We were thrilled to add 1.8 million domestic subscribers in Q2, 75% more than Q2 of last year when we  significantly increased subs by launching Netflix on the Wii game platform. The virtuous cycle we’ve  mentioned before of increased investment in streaming content, strong word of mouth and an  expanding range of devices continued to bear fruit. In the U.S., we ended the quarter with 24.6 million  domestic subscribers, 64% more than the comparable previous year period.  During the quarter, the streaming only plan continued to gain in popularity, with nearly 75% of our new  subscribers signing up for it. As a result, our average subscription price reverted to a slight quarter-over- quarter decline, after the one quarter impact in Q1 of our November 2010 price change.  With the rapid adoption of streaming, DVD shipments for Netflix have likely peaked.  Also, in Q2 the  total number of subscribers who were on hybrid plans (and, therefore eligible to receive DVDs) declined  slightly from Q1.   We’ve spoken frequently of how we are directing savings generated from declining DVD demand into  additional streaming content and marketing. During the quarter, we substantially increased sequential  spending on streaming content as titles from our new content deals (discussed below) became available  for streaming. At the same time, though, we maintained a disciplined approach to what content we  license and at what price, spending somewhat less on streaming content than we budgeted for in the  quarter. Also, DVD shipments came in even lower than forecasted, in part due to the popularity of our  streaming only plan.   The net impact:  our domestic operating margin came in at 16.3%, above our 14% target. Going forward  in the second half of 2011, we expect to increase our investment in streaming content, thus reaching  our 14% domestic operating margin target.         13.0%  11.6% 12.0% 11.8%  14.9%  13.0%  14.8%  16.0% 16.3%  Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Domestic Operating Margin  Actual Annual Targets     3  Domestic content licensing   During Q2, we secured great new content for streaming and expanded our existing partnerships with  movie studios and broadcast and cable networks.   For feature films, we reached agreements with Miramax and Revolution Studios to add several hundred  movies on a rotating basis, giving our subscribers access to critically acclaimed films such as “Pulp  Fiction,” “Good Will Hunting,” “Black Hawk Down,” “Across the Universe,” and “Shakespeare in Love” as  well as box office favorites like “Daddy Day Care,” “Hellboy,” and “Anger Management.” We also  announced a multi-year deal with Open Road Films to exclusively offer an exciting slate of first-run films  to watch instantly shortly after they are released on DVD.  The first films from our previously announced  deal with Relativity Media have just started to flow and “The Fighter” and “Skyline” are shaping up to be  big hits with our subscribers.  Netflix members love great television shows as much as they love movies, and are now spending over  half of overall streaming hours enjoying a wide range of TV programming.  In Q2, we added thousands of  TV episodes through significant multi-year renewals with Viacom’s media networks and NBC Universal.  These agreements not only add new seasons of shows that have enjoyed great success among our  subscribers, but expand to new shows licensed by these companies.   In the case of NBCU, we’ve secured access to great NBC primetime hits on a prior-season basis, including  “30 Rock,” “Parenthood,” and “The Office.” Complete previous seasons of cable favorites like SyFy’s  “Warehouse 13,” USA’s “Psych,” and E’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” are also part of the deal.   With Viacom, we’ve expanded our agreement to include a wide range of programming from MTV,  Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET and TV Land, including complete seasons of “Jersey Shore,”  “SpongeBob SquarePants,” “South Park,” “Hot in Cleveland,” and “Basketball Wives.”    In a few days, every episode of “Mad Men” will become available in syndication exclusively on Netflix.    Additional seasons will become available on Netflix once they complete their run on AMC.  Since Mad  Men is strongly serialized, we expect significant viewing of prior seasons as new viewers get hooked and  seek the back story during the upcoming fifth season and beyond.  Netflix subscribers now have access to a wide range of programming from all four major U.S. broadcast  networks and from nearly every major cable channel, as well as thousands of films, including those in  their first subscription window, from Paramount, MGM, Disney, Lionsgate and a host of mini-major and  independent studios.  In June, we told our members that Sony movies through Starz Plus would be unavailable to watch  instantly from Netflix due to a contract dispute between Sony and Starz, to which we are not a party.  As  we said then, we are hopeful these two valued partners will resolve this issue soon. Additionally, we  continue to be in discussions with Starz to renew our agreement beyond the first quarter of 2012.           4  Domestic competition  As we’ve said previously, our largest competitor over time is likely to be an improved MVPD service  offering more Internet video on-demand, and thus reducing the number of people who will be attracted  by a supplementary service like Netflix. HBO GO is an example of this: HBO subscribers can watch HBO  on-demand through their MVPD provider web interface (DishOnline.com, say), or through the HBO GO  dedicated application.    Over time, both the DishOnline application and the HBO GO application, amongst others, will likely get  built into smart TVs or be available in smart TV app stores.   While HBO GO and Netflix do not have  overlapping content, and many consumers subscribe to both Netflix and HBO, we do compete with HBO  for studio content and for viewers’ time. Our task is to consistently improve the quality of our service  and stay two steps ahead, so that consumers will continue to enjoy Netflix.  We are also mindful of Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime.   Hulu Plus added about 325,000 subs in Q2; we  added close to 2 million.   We invest much more than Hulu Plus in content, in marketing, and in R&D.    Since Hulu is likely to be sold in the near term, it is unknown who will run it and how much they will  invest in the subscription part of the Hulu service. We aren’t planning to bid on Hulu because most of its  revenue is from providing free ad-supported streaming of current season TV shows, which is not our  focus.  Amazon recently added thousands of films and TV shows, and includes them as a free service to  subscribers of its Prime shipping service.  We have vastly more streaming content, are available on more  streaming devices and are purely focused on subscription video streaming.  So far, we haven’t detected  an impact on our business from Amazon Prime.   Separating DVD by mail and streaming into two distinct plans in the U.S.  Earlier this month, we separated DVD by mail and streaming into two distinct plans, and we feel each  one represents unbeatable value in the marketplace.     Our new pricing, $7.99 for unlimited DVD by mail, is the lowest price for DVD by mail offered by anyone,  and we have the best service levels.   In addition, $7.99 for unlimited commercial-free streaming is an  extremely attractive proposition, with our new subscribers overwhelmingly choosing this plan.  Combined, for $15.98, these two plans provide a tremendous entertainment value for consumers who  want both DVD and streaming.  We didn’t change the pricing for our streaming only subscribers, and those members will get to enjoy  more and better streaming content going forward.  Subscribers who only want DVDs from us are happy  with the introduction of DVD only plans, because they can pay $7.99 instead of $9.99, a 20% savings.  It  is expected and unfortunate that our DVD subscribers who also use streaming don’t like our price  change, which can be as much as a 60% increase for them from $9.99 to $15.98, when it goes into effect  for each subscriber upon their renewal date in September.        5  Some subscribers will cancel Netflix or downgrade their Netflix plans.  We expect most to stay with us  because each of our $7.99 plans is an incredible value.  We hate making our subscribers upset with us,  but we feel like we provide a fantastic service and we’re working hard to further improve the quality and  range of our streaming content in Q4 and beyond.    In addition to separating the plans, we are setting up a dedicated DVD division, led by twelve-year  Netflix veteran Andy Rendich, to focus on running a successful DVD by mail service in the U.S. for a long  time.  Andy and his team will be located nearby in San Jose, and are already planning some great  improvements for the DVD service. Because we believe we can best generate profits and satisfaction by  keeping DVD by mail as a division, we have no intention of selling it. In Q4, we’ll also return to marketing  our DVD by mail service, something we haven’t done for many quarters.  Our goal is to keep DVD as  healthy as possible for as many years as possible.    Our estimate is that by end of Q3 in the U.S., we’ll have about 22 million people subscribing to our  streaming service, about 15 million people subscribing to our DVD service, and about 25 million total U.S.  subscribers (with about 12 million people subscribing to both streaming and DVD).       In Q3 we will see only the negative impact of the pricing change, given that the announcement was early  in the quarter and that the increases won’t take effect until late in the quarter (September 15th on  average).  We expect domestic net additions in Q3 to be lower than the previous year Q3, and because  of the timing of the price change, revenues will only grow slightly on a sequential basis.  In Q4, we expect domestic net additions to return to a pattern of year-over-year growth while revenue  will reflect a full quarter’s impact of the pricing changes, which could result in Q4 being our first billion  dollar global revenue quarter, driven by strong U.S. performance.        6  While we expect our revenue to increase in Q4 from this pricing change, we are still targeting a 14%  domestic operating margin because we will continue to increase our spending on streaming content,  ensuring the service remains by far the best value out there when it comes to enjoying instant, on- demand movies and TV shows.  Q4 will also be the first quarter with a clean separation of the costs for our DVD and streaming services.  In January, we’ll report on Q4 with greater segment detail, breaking out domestic DVD, domestic  streaming and international streaming. Domestic DVD will incorporate its own technology and  development costs, as well as G&A, providing a straightforward picture of operating income. Domestic  and international streaming share technology, development and G&A expenses, so we’ll be reporting  contribution profit (i.e. gross profit less marketing) for each segment as well as the shared global  streaming technology, development and G&A costs. Starting this quarter, contribution profit has been  added to our segment reporting as a new metric.  Canada results  We continue to generate strong subscriber growth in Canada, and we’re up to nearly 1 million  subscribers in just 10 months.  We continue to learn from our experiences in Canada in preparation for  other international markets.  We recently launched Canadian French support for our service, and Netflix  looks great, of course, in French:     The key to continued growth, both domestically and internationally, is constant improvements to the  service.  We’ll be adding more content to our Canadian service and now expect that we’ll come in at   between $1 million contribution loss and $1 million contribution profit in Q3.          7  Latin America and beyond…  Early this month, we announced that we would be launching in Latin America as our second  international market later this year. Consumers in 43 countries across Mexico, South America and the  Caribbean will soon be able to enjoy unlimited TV shows and movies streamed instantly over the  Internet to their TVs and computers at one low monthly subscription price. We will have more to say  about this new market at the time of launch, but we are very excited about the opportunity. Specifically,  Latin America represents a large and rapidly growing market of broadband households (currently, ~40  million), consumers there enjoy Hollywood content, and we are able to take advantage of economies of  scale by licensing content regionally.   As we said last quarter, we intend to launch our third international market in Q1 2012. Depending on  content licensing discussions underway, we may launch one or more new countries in Q1.  As in Latin  America, we intend to offer a compelling mix of Hollywood, regional and local content.   In April of this year, we anticipated generating international operating losses of up to $70 million in the  second half of this year, which we were comfortable with given the size of the opportunity in Latin  America. Our current estimate for international operating losses in the second half of 2011 is now up to  $80 million which includes pre-launch expenses for the one or more countries we may launch in Q1  2012.   New user interface on laptops  In June, we updated the Netflix website with a new interface to provide more focus on the TV shows &  movies available to watch instantly, making it even easier for subscribers to find something they’d love  to watch. The title images are larger, there are more of them on the page and play buttons appear when  you track over the title image. Star ratings, synopsis and other functions are also easier and more  intuitive to access.  We are always testing new approaches to improve the service, so we were very pleased that hours  viewed have increased since the new interface was launched. We also received tremendous feedback,  not all of it positive, on the change and are incorporating some of that feedback into making the user  experience even better. We’re constantly testing ways to improve the website experience and the  overall service.  Facebook  We’ve made great progress over the quarter on our Facebook integration and we’ll likely launch it  before our next earnings report.  At this point, we plan to launch this initiative only in Canada and Latin  America, as the VPPA (Video Privacy Protection Act) discourages us from launching our Facebook  integration domestically.  Under the VPPA, it is ambiguous when and how a user can give permission for  his or her video viewing data to be shared.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a simple  clarification, HR2471, which says when and how a user can give such permission.  We’re hoping HR2471  passes, enabling us to offer our Facebook integration to our U.S. subscribers who desire it.      8  Cord mending  For the second quarter in a row, U.S. MVPD households grew in Q1, adding nearly 500,000 additional  households and deepening evidence that cord-cutting in the past was prompted by economic hard times  rather than the substitution of over-the-top (OTT) services for cable.  Since MVPD households are growing while online video use explodes, the data suggests that OTT  services like Netflix are complementary to, rather than competitive with, cable television. In this way,  the growth of Netflix streaming is no different to the prior growth of the DVD rental market – both  supplemental to the programming offering of the MVPDs. Our subscribers overwhelmingly enjoy both  Netflix and the wide variety of sports, current season TV shows, news and entertainment available  through MVPDs.   Netflix beating Bit Torrent piracy  In May, analysts at Sandvine published a report on global broadband trends suggesting that people are  watching and downloading more video over the Internet than ever before. Given the popularity of our  streaming service and the growth we’ve experienced in streaming subscribers and hours viewed, we  were not surprised by this finding. What did pleasantly surprise us was how we compared to other  providers of Internet video. Our low cost, high quality, on demand streaming service has become so  good that the largest percentage of the Internet’s traffic is for paid content instead of illegal free peer- to-peer sites like Bit Torrent.  Over coming quarters we’ll see if we can recreate this “beat piracy” feat  outside of North America.    FCF & buyback  Free cash flow of $59.5 million increased sharply year-over-year (74%), but was down 25% quarter-over- quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by lower deferred revenue, and an interest payment in the  quarter, partially offset by higher net income.     $26  $26  $30  $38  $34  $8  $51  $79  $60  $32  $30  $31  $32  $44  $38    $31  $32  $44  $38  $47  $60  $68  Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Net Income and Free Cash Flow   (in millions)  Free Cash Flow GAAP Net Income     9  The expected ramp up in our streaming content investment discussed in our January and April letters is  reflected on our cash flow statements as a significant sequential increase in additions to our streaming  content library: $192 million in Q1 rising to $613 million in Q2.  The increase in library additions reflects  several large previously announced content deals (e.g. MTV, Miramax, Fox, CBS & NBCU) becoming  available for streaming, and therefore being recognized as assets on our balance sheet.  Due to this  increase in library assets, our streaming content liabilities also reflected a significant increase of $420  million related to all payments not yet due under these contracts.  As a reminder, when a content license agreement meets the criteria for library asset recognition, we  recognize the full value of the agreement as an asset in our content library while unpaid portions are  recognized as liabilities. Since many of our agreements are multi-year, the additions will be amortized  and the liabilities paid, in most cases, over several years. In sum, A/P and other non-current liabilities  (long-term A/P) will increase as titles from new deals become available on our service.  We’ve provided additional disclosures on our cash flow statements this quarter to help investors better  understand the accounting for our streaming content licenses – specifically, we have broken out the  change in streaming content liabilities from all other A/P and other non-current liabilities. We have also  separated amortization of streaming content from amortization of DVD content.  As we’ve stated previously, we continue to insist on close matching of cash and expense for our  streaming content deals.  Our Latin American launch will require some minor up-front spending that will  moderate our free cash flow in Q3.    We used $51.4 million in Q2 to repurchase 216,000 shares at an average cost basis of $238, and ended  the quarter with $376 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Debt  Our current $200 million of issued debt trades at a nearly 400 basis point spread to similar-duration  treasuries.   We don’t expect to issue additional debt while our pricing is at these BB levels.  Since we  used the $200 million for stock buyback at sub $100 prices, we are very happy with our debt issue  overall.  Our debt, which has an 8.5% coupon, is first callable in November 2013.            10  Business Outlook  Guidance  Domestic Q3 2011:    Total U.S. Subscribers  24.6m to 25.4m      U.S. Streaming Subscriptions  21.6m to 23.3m      U.S. DVD Subscriptions  14.6m to 15.7m  Revenue  $780m to $805m  Operating Income  $95m to $120m        International Q3 2011:    Subscribers  1,150k to 1,450k  Revenue  $19.5m to $23.5m  Operating Loss  ($27.5m) to ($22.5m)        Global Q3 2011:    Net Income  $39m to $58m  EPS  $0.72 to $1.07    Summary  We’re proud to be able to announce another strong quarter of subscriber and earnings growth. At the  same time, we are enthusiastically focused on expanding our streaming content library and improving  the user experience to stay ahead of our domestic competition and to give us substantial advantage as  we move to become a global leader in video streaming.  Sincerely,       Reed Hastings, CEO                         David Wells, CFO            11  Conference Call Q&A Session   Netflix management will host a webcast Q&A session at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time today to answer  questions about the Company’s financial results and business outlook.  Please email your questions to  ir@netflix.com.  The company will read the questions aloud on the call and respond to as many  questions as possible.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important  liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is  available to repay debt obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other  activities.  Management believes that contribution profit is useful in assessing the relative contribution  to operating income of each segment by eliminating any allocation of Technology & Development and  G&A expenses that apply across these segments.  However, this non-GAAP measure should be  considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and net  cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with  GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.\n",

      "12  Financial Performance    Our U.S. member base grew to more than 36 million on the strength of our ever-improving content  offering, including Orange is the New Black Season 2.   For Q3, we expect about 1.3 million net additions,  comparable to Q3’13 in which we premiered Orange Season 1.  We are pleased our net additions in the  U.S. remain on par with last year.       Our U.S. contribution margin expanded 460 bps y/y to 27.1%, as revenue continued to grow faster than  spending on content and marketing.  As previously mentioned, we’ll re-evaluate our current 400 bps y/y  margin improvement target once we achieve a 30% contribution margin sometime next year.  The three  models we are evaluating are 400, 200, and 100 basis points margin improvement per year over the  next few years.      Outside the U.S., we generated continued growth in all of our markets.  We ended Q2 with 13.8 million  international members, growing 78% y/y.  In September, we’ll be launching Netflix in Germany, France,  Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg.  This launch into markets with over 60 million  broadband households will significantly increase our European presence and raise our current  international addressable market to over 180 million broadband households, or 2x the number of  current U.S. broadband households.    Our international contribution loss of ($15.3) million has been rapidly approaching contribution  profitability as we see improvements across all existing markets.  Our broad success from Argentina to  Finland has convinced us to further invest aggressively in global expansion.  Our European expansion  this quarter will add new expenses to the segment, so we expect a consolidated contribution loss of  ($42) million for the international segment in Q3.  Even after our upcoming expansion in Europe, we’ll  only address about one-third (271 million of 728 million1 ) of current global broadband households,  providing a great opportunity to build on our international success beyond 2014.  As explained in our  Long Term Letter, our plan remains to run at about global break-even to fund investment in global  expansion.      In May, we raised prices modestly in most of our markets for new members on our two screens at-a- time HD plan, and introduced a one screen at-a-time, standard definition plan across our markets.  Our  two screen HD plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new members.  We expect ARPU  to rise slowly as members at the new prices grow as a percentage of total membership.  There was  minimal impact on membership growth from this price change.                                                        1 SNL Kagan   3    Content    Original Series     The release of Orange is the New Black Season 2 has been every bit the global media event we had  hoped for; critically acclaimed and embraced by a fervent and growing fan base.  In its first month,  Orange became the most watched series in every Netflix territory, with many members either watching  for the first time or re-watching Season 1, in addition to the 13 new episodes of Season 2.    Earlier this month, Netflix original series and documentaries received 31 Emmy nominations, more than  double the 14 we received in our first year of releasing original programming. In its first year of  eligibility, Orange received 12 nominations, more than any other comedy series, while nominations for  House of Cards grew from 9 last year to 13 this year. Notably, these two shows were nominated for  Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Drama Series while The Square, which received 4  nominations, is up for Outstanding Documentary. It is quite rare for a single network to receive  nominations in all three of these categories as well as Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead  Actress for both drama (Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright for House of Cards) and comedy (Ricky Gervais  for Derek and Taylor Schilling for Orange.)     Hemlock Grove debuted July 11 and has already begun to build on its Season 1 audience. We have been  very pleased with the second season of Derek that launched in May and with the launch of our latest  original documentary The Battered Bastards of Baseball.     In the coming weeks, we will premiere the all new 4th and final season of The Killing (8/1) and a new  adult animated comedy BoJack Horseman (8/22).  Also in August, we will release Mission Blue (8/15)  from the Oscar-winning director of The Cove, Fisher Stevens.     Reflecting the increasingly global nature of the Netflix service, we now have original series in production  around the world, involving some of the best storytellers working in television and film today. Marco  Polo, a historical adventure from Executive Producer Harvey Weinstein, is shooting in Kazakhstan and  Malaysia.  In New York there is Marvel’s Daredevil, the first of our original series from Marvel Television,  as well as the already eagerly-anticipated third season of Orange is the New Black; while in Baltimore,  production is underway on the third season of House of Cards.  In the Florida Keys, the creators of  Damages (Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman, and Todd Kessler) are shooting a dark family thriller with an  ensemble cast led by Kyle Chandler, Sissy Spacek, Sam Shepard, Linda Cardellini, Ben Mendelsohn, and  Norbert Leo Butz.  Sense8, a mind-bending series from the Wachowskis (The Matrix trilogy, Cloud Atlas)  and J. Michael Straczynski (Babylon 5), began production in San Francisco last month, is now in Chicago,  and will shoot in many international locations this year.     4  In August, production begins in Los Angeles on Grace and Frankie, a comedy led by Jane Fonda, Lily  Tomlin, Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston; and in Colombia, Brazilian director José Padilha (Elite Squad,  Robocop) will begin filming Narcos with an all-star international cast led by Wagner Moura.    During the quarter, we announced our first-ever talk show, hosted by Chelsea Handler, the popular  comedian and best-selling author.  As with scripted programming, but unlike news or sports, fewer  people are watching talk shows live and are instead watching stacked episodes on DVR or online in the  days and weeks following initial airing.  Our intent is to produce a show with Handler and her team that  reflects this shift to on-demand enjoyment and that will appeal to a global audience.  Handler recently  taped her first special for Netflix -- a stand-up show that’s been sold out across the U.S., the U.K. and  Ireland -- and will produce four more in 2015 before we launch the talk show in early 2016.    Marketing    In Q2 we focused our marketing on the launch of the second season of Orange is the New Black in each  of our markets.  This campaign represents our largest content marketing push to date and we are  pleased with the reaction from fans.  Social media sentiment was overwhelmingly positive and search  volume validated that we had a big hit on our hands.  Season 3 next year should be even bigger.    Our Netflix brand advertising continues to resonate with consumers, highlighting the fun ways people’s  lives are enriched when they watch something great. Our well-received You’ve Got to Get it To Get It  campaign in Canada was extended with three new ads “Airport”, “Test Results”, and “Proposal” this  quarter. We ran the first ad in the campaign, “Pep Talk”, during the NHL playoffs and were delighted  when New York Rangers head coach Alain Vigneault picked up the joke during a pre-game press  conference, leading the NHL Network to interview the coach from our ad.    Another successful example of our brand advertising is our Viva Netflix campaign in Mexico which began  with “Abuelita,” featuring a fun take on local family viewing habits, quickly followed by  “Oribe” in which  Mexico’s star striker returns home from the World Cup slightly earlier than his spouse expected.    In Q2 we updated our logo from the red block with white letters to the cleaner red letters.  We were  pleased to execute this transition with the minimum of distraction.                5  In-Store Gift Cards Coming This Fall    We are introducing physical gift cards in select stores in the U.S., Canada,  Mexico, and Germany starting later this year.  In mature markets, gift cards will  extend our brand presence and make it easier to access Netflix. In newer  markets, gift cards help build the brand and provide an easier alternative for  consumers to join Netflix in markets with developing online payments.        Product    MVPD Set-Top Boxes    The Netflix app on Virgin Media set-top boxes in the U.K. continues to be a compelling streaming  experience that delivers above-median viewing and satisfaction.  We continue to gain traction in our  international markets with set-top box integration and, in the U.S., launched the Netflix app on the TiVo  platform with several regional MVPDs including Suddenlink, RCN, Grande and Atlantic Broadband during  the quarter.  MVPDs would rather their customers’ use Netflix on their set-top and remote than use  Netflix on Internet set-tops such as Apple TV, partially because that drives the pay-per-view  consumption for the respective set-top owner.      Android TV Platform     The Netflix app for Google's Android TV platform will appear on TVs from Sony, Sharp, and others in the  coming months. Widespread adoption of Android TV can reduce the number of different platforms we  need to support to ensure Netflix is broadly available on Smart TVs delivering a consistently first-rate  experience, no matter the vendor. Android TV incorporates Google's \"cast\" feature, allowing content  discovery on mobile devices and laptops with streaming delivered to the big screen.    Smart TV growing in Latin America    Post World Cup, the number of Smart TVs used for Netflix viewing in Latin American countries is at a  new high; in fact, the percentage of viewing from Smart TVs in Latin America is higher than any other  region we serve.  Members accessing Netflix on a big screen generally watch more and retain better  than members using smaller devices.    UHD 4K Video Quality    We are now streaming flagship content in UHD 4K to members with 4K Smart TVs, putting Netflix at the  leading edge of high-quality AV delivery. Already, Samsung, LG, and Sony have in retail around the world  6  4K Smart TVs, and House of Cards Season 2 and all seasons of Breaking Bad are now available for  streaming in the new format.  Content available to stream in 4K will grow steadily as several of our  original series are or will be shooting in 4K, including Marco Polo, Sense8, and Narcos.  UHD 4K will be an  Internet-centric format as linear TV will be late to switch their networks to UHD 4K.   Strong Net Neutrality  Our focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, is about preventing large ISPs from  holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance to extract payments from us, other Internet  content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent.  Our policy goals are for the FCC to not sanctify paid prioritization, and for the DOJ/FCC to block the  merger of Comcast/TWC, or at the very least, to require as condition to approving the merger that the  combined entity be prevented from charging for interconnection.  6.3 Million U.S. DVD Memberships  Our DVD-by-mail business continues to satisfy 6.3 million members.  Contribution profit for the segment  was $92.8 million in the quarter, as expected, and we anticipate $90 million for Q3.  A year ago in Q2,  we lost 475k DVD memberships.  In Q2 this year it was only 391k.   DVD and Blu-ray offer amazing and  comprehensive selection that keeps a core membership uniquely satisfied.  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are here:  April 2014, January 2014, October  2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013, October 2012, July 2012.  Summary We have a huge global opportunity ahead and a lot of challenges too.  We are thrilled for the creators of  our original series and documentaries who earned 31 Emmy nominations this year, and whose  incredible work is being enjoyed by many of our 50 million members.  7  Sincerely,                                                                                           Reed Hastings, CEO      David Wells, CFO                                                                                                                         21st July 2014 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview at 2 p.m. Pacific  Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  8  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance; content  offerings; marketing; gift cards; device and platform integration; member growth domestically and  internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, average revenue per subscriber, contribution  profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international  operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash  flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could  cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service  disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, widespread consumer adoption  of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward- looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our  Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.

      "We are delighted to report another strong quarter of growth in subscribers, now at 23.6 million globally, revenue and earnings. This growth underscores the value of our increased spending on an ever-broader selection of TV shows and movies, our constantly improving personalization technology, and the Netflix brand. Our Q1 summary results, plus those of the prior eight quarters, are provided in the table below. 1Domestic Subscriber Growth & Average Subscription Price We were thrilled to add 3.3 million domestic subscribers in Q1, nearly double the number added in Q1 of 2010. The virtuous cycle we’ve mentioned previously of increased investment in streaming content, strong word of mouth and an expanding device ecosystem truly worked for us in the quarter. In addition, we spent record amounts marketing Netflix, per the margin discussion below. Looking forward, our prior period comps for net adds are going to get tougher, and while we expect our net adds the rest of this year to continue to exceed those of the prior year, it won’t be at a pace of nearly 2X like in Q1. With net adds forecast to grow every quarter on a Y/Y basis, we remain in the first half of the S curve of adoption. As always, we will remain focused on improving our service, keeping Netflix in the first half of the curve, and thereby increasing Y/Y net adds, as long as possible. Our pure streaming plan and a price increase on our hybrid offerings were put into place in November 2010, and the price increase largely took effect in Q1. As a result, our average subscription price increased sequentially from Q4 to Q1. During the quarter, new subscribers embraced the pure streaming and hybrid plans in roughly equal numbers. Going forward, we believe the ASP trend will revert back to slight Q/Q decline as pure streaming becomes a larger part of the overall subscriber mix. Domestic Operating Margin In January, we spoke of redirecting the savings generated from a flattening DVD shipment trend into additional streaming content and marketing. We took marketing up as much as was efficient in Q1. But as we anticipated in January, the lead time required to complete increasingly large and complex content deals meant we weren’t able to spend the entirety of these funds. That, coupled with stronger-than- expected subscriber growth, and hence additional revenue and profit, meant our domestic operating margin in Q1 increased above our 14% target margin to 16% (see graph below). Domestic Operating Margin 16.0% 14.8% 14.9% 13.0% 13.0% 11.6% 11.9% 11.7% 9.1% Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 2    3  Going forward in Q2 and beyond, we expect DVD shipments to decline slightly Y/Y, spending on  streaming content to increase substantially, and spending on marketing to decline from Q1, bringing our  domestic operating margin back to our desired goal of around 14%.  As we’ve stated previously,  domestic gross margin also should return to the 30% -35% range as we spend more on streaming.  Q1 Consolidated Earnings Outperformance   Our consolidated net income of $60.2 million and diluted EPS of $1.11 were at the high end of our  guidance range due to the earnings outperformance in the U.S discussed earlier.  As we’ll discuss later in  the letter, our international loss in Canada was right in-line with our guidance, with lower costs  offsetting slightly lower-than-anticipated subscriber revenue.   Domestic Streaming Content   In Q1, we completed several important streaming content deals, bringing in additional first-time  partners, extending and expanding relationships with other providers and pioneering some new  approaches we believe will help Netflix continue to differentiate itself. The result is that Netflix  subscribers can instantly enjoy a wider and better selection of TV shows and movies than ever before.   Our agreement with CBS is particularly notable, as Netflix is now the only online premium subscription  service that offers shows from all four broadcast networks, as well as many of the largest cable TV  networks.  The arrangement includes only a few on-air shows at present, but provides the framework  for future shows to appear on Netflix while immediately unlocking a broad selection of classic television  episodes.  With Fox and Lionsgate, we increased the scope of our deals to increase the quality and quantity of TV  shows available for our subscribers to stream, while obtaining off-network rights to five very popular on- air series, for the first-time in our history.   The Fox deal guarantees all previous seasons’ episodes of the top rated show “Glee” and the F/X hit  show “Sons of Anarchy” for years to come. This multi-year, non-exclusive, agreement ensures access to  current and all future episodes.  It is similar to a syndication deal, except that episodes are made  available the season after they air, unlike typical syndication deals that do not begin until a show  completes at least four seasons of broadcast. The first season of “Glee” and the first two seasons of  “Sons of Anarchy” are now available to stream on Netflix.   With Lionsgate, we obtained exclusive syndication rights for “Mad Men.” Beginning in July, the first four  seasons of this award winning series will be available to stream, with new seasons appearing every year  until the series is completed. For the first several years of our deal, those seasons will not be available to  other broadcast or cable networks. Separately, we extended and made exclusive our current Lionsgate  deals for the popular Showtime series “Weeds” and the Spike TV show “Blue Mountain State”.  As streaming grows, TV shows and feature films are being enjoyed in nearly equivalent volume by our  subscribers and our content acquisition team is focusing their attention accordingly.  We’ve recently  added lots of new TV episodes, and the profile and completeness of the shows continues to improve. As      4  for movies, we’ve recently added a large number of core catalog titles from Paramount that are  exclusive to Netflix against broadcast, cable and other over-the-top services and titles from Lionsgate  and MGM that are exclusive against other over-the-top services.   While the size of these deals and their impact on our P&L is often speculated about in the press,  spending typically takes place over multiple years and the amortized cost of these deals is taken into  consideration in our 14% target operating margin model.  House of Cards  Lots of attention was paid to our decision to license the exclusive rights to premiere Media Rights  Capital’s “House of Cards” series, planned for late 2012.  Rather than a shift in strategy towards original programming, our decision was driven by a desire to test  a new licensing model using a small portion of our content budget. Serialized dramas, like the original  BBC series on which “House of Cards” is based, have been big favorites on Netflix and we want to  confirm our theory that because we are click-and-watch rather than appointment viewing, we can  efficiently build a big audience for a well-produced serialized show .  This represents slightly greater  creative risk than we’ve taken in the past, but we think it’s reasonable given the popularity of the  original BBC show on Netflix and the modest percentage of our content budget it represents. If “House  of Cards” is popular enough on Netflix so that the fee we’ve paid is in line with that of other equally  popular content on Netflix at the time, we’ll consider it a success.   Ideally, we’ll license two or three similar, but smaller, deals so we can gain confidence that whatever  results we achieve are repeatable.    While we’re still negotiating the final details of this deal, both the P&L and cash costs would only begin  when “House of Cards” premieres in late 2012.    Cord Mending replaces Cord Cutting    Given what’s happened in the music and newspaper industries, producers of movies and TV shows  naturally enough fear Internet services will hurt their existing business. That fear was heightened last  year when, during some quarters, total MVPD households in the U.S. contracted for the first time in  history, leading to extensive speculation over two possible drivers of “cord cutting”: (1) the rise of  entertainment available via the Internet; and (2) the recession, specifically the decline in household  formation, rampant foreclosures, and the rise in unemployment.     Since last year, online video use has more than doubled and the recession has receded somewhat. So, if  online video use was driving cord cutting, the behavior would have intensified. On the other hand, if it  was the recession that was driving people to drop MVPD subscriptions, cord cutting would have  moderated. In fact, not only did cord cutting slow, it became cord mending with total U.S. MVPD  households growing in the latest estimates.          5  Simply put, the data shows that Netflix is a supplemental channel to MVPD. While Netflix is likely to  show huge growth again this year, we think MVPD cord cutting will be minimal to non-existent. We hear  some stories from customers who have Netflix and no MVPD service, but these are generally people  who rely on free broadcast TV (which is now in HD) and supplement with Netflix, rather than switching  from MVPD to online.      Recently, the CEO of an MVPD characterized Netflix as “rerun TV”.  While we don’t plan to use that line  in our next marketing campaign, he is fundamentally correct.   Our focus for TV shows is on prior season  TV and completeness of series, because this class of content enables us to license content broadly and  provide consumers a differentiated experience.  Also, when we offer prior seasons of “Glee” or “Mad  Men”, we think we grow the audience for current season on MVPD.  We hope over time that HBO and  Showtime will let us prove this proposition for them.   We think more and more evidence that prior  season on Netflix helps current season on MVPD will become apparent from our deals with Disney,  Viacom, CBS, NBCU and others.      Looking at it from all of these angles, content owners that license to Netflix make more money – now  and in the future – than content owners who don’t license to Netflix. A few media executives are still  vocal about their fears of negative long-term impact on MVPD subscriptions from Netflix, but the  evidence continues to pile up against their concerns.   Our subscribers overwhelmingly enjoy both their  Netflix and the variety of sports, current season TV shows, news and entertainment available through  MVPDs.      Competition    Over the past 12 months, both Hulu Plus and free video on Amazon Prime have launched.  We also think  Dish Networks is likely to launch a substantial subscription streaming effort under the Blockbuster  brand.   Our competitive strategy relative to other streaming services is simply to grow as fast as we can,  so we can afford more content, more marketing, and more R&D than our competitors.       Our biggest competitor over time may be another service with a similar model to Netflix, such as Hulu  Plus, or it may be free on-demand Internet video as a part of a consumer’s MVPD package, namely TV  Everywhere.   This free bundling of a subset of our functionality within a larger subscription service is a  classic way for an incumbent to leverage its strength. While TV Everywhere is not a strong offering  today, it is likely to become much better over the coming years. We’ll continue to push ahead,  developing an ever-better user experience to differentiate Netflix, and exploring exclusive rights, where  it makes sense, such as our “Mad Men” deal, so that we remain complementary to MVPD.  Several studios have begun allowing MVPDs to offer a premium $30 early window pay-per-view option  for the home. Additionally, some studios are marketing titles on a PPV basis through the Apple app store  and on Facebook.  We don’t think this PPV activity will have a material impact to Netflix growth.   PPV is  a good way for content owners to maximize profits before a title is released for subscription.  In PPV, the  brand is the individual piece of content, a very different model from the subscription business.       6    DVD was a Booster Rocket, but is not a Differentiator    We believe that DVD will be a fading differentiator given the explosive growth of streaming, and that in  order to prosper in streaming we must concentrate on having the best possible streaming service.  As a  result, we are beginning to treat them separately in many ways.  Already, if you look at our signup page  for non-members, it is all about streaming.  Having said this, DVD rental is still a great business for us,  and we are working on solutions to make sure DVD continues to be a profitable business for us in the  years ahead, but it is not core to winning in streaming at this point.      International  Our growth in Canada was strong and consistent throughout Q1. Less than seven months from launch,  we ended the quarter with just over 800,000 subscribers. We are still learning the seasonality curve and  nuances specific to Canada, however, and we slightly over-forecast the quarter.    During the quarter, we made great progress in increasing the quality and volume of content available to  our Canadian subscribers. At the end of Q1 we began an output deal with Paramount, in which all of its  movies will be available on Netflix streaming just a few months after DVD release.  In addition we  licensed several popular TV series from Sony, including “Breaking In”, and “Mad Love”, and from Fox,  including “Prison Break”, “Firefly”, “Arrested Development”, and “Saving Grace”.  In Q2, we will continue  to increase our content spending in Canada and begin to incur some small expenses for our second  international market, both of which are reflected in our guidance for international operating loss. Then,  after achieving profitability in Q3 in Canada, we will stay at approximately break-even in Canada for a  few quarters in order to further strengthen the availability of our streaming content there.  We shared in our letter last quarter that if early results in our second international market confirmed  our belief that we can reach positive operating income within eight quarters of launch, we would launch  successive international markets.   We also stated we expected to report approximately $50 million in  operating losses for international in the second half of the year due to the launch of our second  international market.   We now anticipate $50 to $70 million in operating losses in the second half,  which we are comfortable with given the size of the opportunity.  We’ve also decided to make some  early content commitments for a third international market given our high probability of success in our  second international market.  These third international market commitments won’t materially affect our  P&L until next year, and we intend to launch the third international market in early 2012.      Data caps    Below is a recent screen shot of Google’s home page in Canada.  You can see that Rogers, a leading ISP  and MVPD in Canada, intercepted the Google page, and inserted the Rogers’ data cap warning screen at  its top.   It stands to reason that Canadian consumers subjected to such data caps – and outrageously      7  high overage charges of $1 or more per gigabyte – will have a less positive view of Internet use and  online video in particular.       In response to these excessive $1+ per gigabyte fees,  we’ve recently changed the default setting for  Canadian Netflix members to an encoding that consumes only 9 gigabytes for 30 hours of viewing versus  30 -70 gigabytes for 30 hours of viewing under our standard encoding.   The video quality is slightly  lower but still very enjoyable.    As a side note, data caps are actually a very poor way to manage demand and limit Internet congestion.    All of the costs of supplying residential broadband are for supporting the peak loads, typically Sunday  nights for residential customers.  Bandwidth consumed off-peak is completely free; it literally has no  marginal costs. If ISPs really wanted to limit their costs and congestion, they would limit speeds at peak  times.  But if their goal is instead to increase revenue, then making consumers pay $1 or more per  gigabyte is an excellent strategy.    When we state the marginal costs of residential wired gigabyte are below one penny, but are not zero,  that is because we are making the appropriate costing assumption that some of an average gigabyte is  transferred at costly peak times.    Canadian consumers have been outspoken against the excessive charges they face, and hopefully  Canadian ISPs will listen to them by raising the caps or abandoning them altogether.       8  The initial response from our Canadian consumers to our move to go to 9 gigabytes for 30 hours of  viewing has been positive, because it seems to relieve most of the fears of overage charges from their  ISP.   If the ISPs eventually abandon the caps, we’ll be able to provide the same peace of mind as well as  the best possible video quality to Canadians.     In the U.S., AT&T recently imposed caps of 250 gigabytes on U-verse fiber Internet subscribers, and 150  gigabytes on DSL subscribers, with a charge of approximately 20c per gigabyte over those limits.   We’ll  study how this affects consumer attitudes about Internet video, and take appropriate steps if needed.    Comcast has had 250 gigabytes caps for years without overage charges and that hasn’t been a problem  for Comcast customers or for us.    FCF & Cash & Buyback   Free cash flow of $79.3 million increased sharply on a Y/Y (108%) and Q/Q (55%) basis. The sequential  increase was driven by higher net income, higher non-cash stock compensation expense, no interest  payment in the quarter, and lower cash taxes, partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue.  To help keep our cash flow strong going forward, we will continue to insist on close matching of cash  and expense for our streaming content deals, but our international investments will slightly moderate  our free cash flow in the second half of the year.    Our strategy over recent years has been to use excess cash to buy back stock. We took a break from that  in Q4 2010 to reassess our cash needs and overall buyback strategy, but returned to buying back stock in  Q1. The objective of our buyback program is simply to return money to our shareholders, similar to a  dividend; consequently, we are neither price sensitive nor market timers. With this objective, we used  $108.6 million in Q1 to repurchase 502,000 shares at an average cost basis of $216.48. Since it was  bought throughout the quarter, it was just under 200,000 shares on a weighted average basis for the  $22  $32  $30  $31  $32  $44  $38  $47  $60  $15  $26  $26  $30  $38  $34  $8  $51  $79  Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Net Income and Free Cash Flow  (in millions)  Net Income FCF     9  quarter-end fully diluted count.  We plan to continue buying back stock, subject as always to an ongoing  analysis of appropriate levels of cash.  We ended the quarter with $343 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Business Outlook      In conclusion, we feel great about the growth we’ve generated, and are very aware that our success in a  fast-growing market makes us an even bigger competitive target. We’re working hard to stay ahead.

For 2011, we’ll continue to report on them for our  domestic business.  Net additions, along with revenue and operating income, are our core performance  measurements.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities.  However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income  and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with  GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.                  11  Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding subscriber growth;  average subscription price; DVD  usage and shipments; streaming content spend; operating margins; content acquisition strategy; cord- cutting/mending; competition;  the fading differentiation of DVD; international expansion, including the  timing of breakeven in Canada and content spend for additional markets;  cash flow and payment terms;   our stock repurchase program;  our subscriber growth, revenue,  and operating income (loss) for both  domestic and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the second  quarter of 2011 . The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  subscribers and retain existing subscribers; our ability to compete effectively; the continued availability  of content on terms and conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion of device platforms  for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service;  disruption in service on our  website or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition and  widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A  detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities  and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and  Exchange Commission on February 18, 2011.

      "Q114-Earnings-Letter-4\n",
      "1Financial Performance Our U.S. streaming service grew by 2.25 million net members to 35.7 million members. Our net additions for Q1 were 0.22 million more than prior year Q1. As we’ve discussed previously, U.S. net additions in Q2 will generally be lower than in the prior year Q2, even in a year with full year growth, due to increased seasonality. This Q2, we expect our domestic net additions to be about 0.11 million below the prior year Q2. International performance in Q1 was also strong. Membership grew by 1.75 million, bringing our international total to 12.7 million members with 72% more net additions than prior year Q1. Due to rapid growth in our international segment we aren’t experiencing the same level of seasonality as in the U.S., and we anticipate over 50% y/y growth in Q2 net additions despite slight headwinds from the World Cup. International revenues currently amount to 25% of our total streaming revenue and we anticipate our international segment to eventually surpass our U.S. market, similar to other Internet firms. International contribution losses shrank by $22 million q/q, with losses more than halved on a y/y basis due to the strong growth in paid members. Our present international segment is on a path to achieve profitability this year. However, our substantial expansion into new European markets (with corresponding investments in content and marketing) in the second half of 2014 will keep our expanded international segment at a net loss. As we’ve discussed in prior investor letters, we intend to continue our international expansion over the coming years, so our near term profits will be quite modest as we invest in this large global opportunity. Free cash flow in the quarter was $8 million versus net income of $53 million. As we’ve highlighted in previous letters, investments in our original series as well as certain non-original licenses, can require higher initial cash payments over the P&L expense. With further international expansion in the second half of this year reducing net income, we expect free cash flow in Q4 to also be reduced. Content Our original programming initiatives gained momentum in Q1. House of Cards, for which Season 2 debuted in February, attracted a huge audience that would make any cable or broadcast network happy. The on-demand nature of Netflix means that as we promote Season 2, we can still see significant new enjoyment of Season 1. Netflix members were able to watch the acclaimed documentary MITT within a week of its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival and we garnered our first Oscar nomination for the impactful documentary 2The Square. During the quarter, we also announced our first original live-action comedy series, Grace and Frankie, featuring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. Already this quarter, we’ve brought members additional episodes of Turbo F.A.S.T. On May 30, we will launch Season 2 of the Ricky Gervais series, Derek, in most territories and on June 6th, we’ll debut Season 2 of Orange is the New Black, giving our members around the globe the opportunity to immerse themselves in this rich and engaging world. The trailer will give you a sense of what’s in store for this tremendously popular show. Our summer line-up includes Hemlock Grove Season 2, the animated comedy series BoJack Horseman and the final six episodes of The Killing. Momentum will continue throughout 2014 and into 2015 as we bring our members additional kids series through our partnership with DreamWorks Animation, and launch new original series including the epic adventure of Marco Polo; a psychological thriller from the creators of Damages; Marvel‘s Daredevil; sci-fi drama Sense 8 from the Wachowskis, and Narcos, an action-drama series from Brazilian director José Padilha on the fall of Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. We are pleased with consumer reception to our early work, as demonstrated in a Morgan Stanley survey from March, showing that 17% of respondents viewed Netflix as the service that offered the best original programming, second only to HBO, and ahead of Showtime and Starz. To have achieved this recognition in our second year of original content creation is exciting and we are optimistic about building on our initial success. We compete for original series with many linear TV networks (CBS, FX, HBO, BBC, etc.) and several Internet firms (Amazon, Hulu, Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo, etc.). Our advantages against other Internet firms are our scale in video and our focus. Our advantages against linear TV networks are Internet on-demand consumption and targeted show marketing. The huge competition amongst all of us for great writers and producers means there’s never been a more robust market for quality serialized television. Outside of North America, we are also becoming the first-run home for many great U.S. TV series. We are releasing those series one episode per week, in order to reduce the time international viewers must wait for local availability. Traditionally, even the most popular American series are withheld from international viewers for several months at a minimum, which has contributed greatly to the growth of piracy. We are tightening that window to less than 7 days, and wherever possible, to within 24 hours. The Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul, as well as From Dusk Till Dawn and Fargo, are among the series premiering on Netflix in international territories. We also continue to invest heavily in exclusive syndication licenses for some of the best series on television. For example, in the U.S., as Mad Men enters its final season, members can jump in or catch up on every previous season’s episode on Netflix. The Walking Dead, Scandal, Bates Motel, The Following, New Girl, Sherlock and The Vampire Diaries are just a few of the exciting on-air series we offer 3exclusively in this model. Dexter, House and Breaking Bad are no longer in production, but continue to be discovered and enjoyed everyday by a huge Netflix audience. Marketing In Q1, our marketing focused on launching House of Cards Season 2 across our global markets. We will continue with this approach in Q2, with a significant push behind the global launch of Orange is the New Black Season 2 on June 6th. Original series represent a tremendous opportunity to raise awareness of, and build consumer enthusiasm for, the Netflix brand. We’ll be investing more in marketing high-quality exclusive content, and spending less on direct response advertising such as banner ads touting free trials. Internationally, we’ve been developing new brand marketing campaigns to strengthen our connection to local consumers. These campaigns are part of a global brand platform highlighting the many ways people find delight in the Netflix experience. Product Today you can walk into a store, buy a new 4K television, take it home, and enjoy a limited selection of streaming 4K content from Netflix. We have House of Cards Season 2 in 4K, as well as an assortment of nature documentaries. The recent WSJ review for one of the Samsung curved-screen 4K TVs featured our 4K content, which we want to be an increasing theme as 4K grows. As 4K TVs become less expensive and more accessible, we will increase our content available in 4K. The best quality consumer video in the world is now streaming Internet video, less than 10 years after YouTube’s 2005 start. We continue to test small and large ideas in promoting the right content to each user. In Q1, we refined and developed the way we promote our original series on the service to better support follow-on seasons, and we are exploring how to do so for selected exclusive catalog content. We also tested and rolled out our row-selection logic that chooses which categories of titles to show to each individual based upon their previous behavior. We remain very happy with the customer embrace of our MVPD set-top box integrations in Europe. This quarter we will launch the first MVPD integrations in the U.S. As we did in Europe, we will start with U.S. MVPDs that use the TiVo set-top box and try to extend to non-TiVo devices after that. From an MVPD point-of-view, they would rather have consumers use Netflix through the MVPD box and remote control than have consumers become accustomed to watching video from a smart TV or Internet TV device remote control. 45  We continue to see more capable Internet television devices launched. Chromecast, Roku Streaming  Stick, and Amazon Fire TV (on which we expect to support voice search later this year) push the quality  of experience and price points for adapter products. Smart TVs from manufacturers like Sony, Samsung,  LG and Vizio are starting to evolve from Internet TV as a “bolt-on” to Internet TV as a critical and  integrated part of the overall device interface.  Roku TV will likely be available in the Fall as one of the  first Internet-centric TVs.  We expect this trend to continually decrease the friction required for our  members to access Netflix and enjoy great content.    As expected, we saw limited impact from our January price increase for new members in Ireland  (from  €6.99 to €7.99), which included grandfathering all existing members at €6.99 for two years.  In the U.S.  we have greatly improved our content selection since we introduced our streaming plan in 2010 at  $7.99 per month.  Our current view is to do a one or two dollar increase, depending on the country,  later this quarter for new members only.  Existing members would stay at current pricing (e.g. $7.99 in  the U.S.) for a generous time period.  These changes will enable us to acquire more content and deliver  an even better streaming experience.    ISP Performance: AT&T Fiber slower than DSL from others    Our long-term ISP performance index shows some positive data, and some surprising data, particularly  in the U.S.  The positive is that Comcast is providing a much improved Netflix experience to their  broadband subscribers, and now nearly all cable Internet households receive great quality Internet  video.  The surprising news is that AT&T fiber-based U-verse has lower performance than many DSL ISPs,  such as Frontier, CenturyLink & Windstream.  This reinforces our view that connectivity to the broader  Internet is critical to the quality of experience consumers receive.  The 249 customer comments on  AT&T’s anti-Netflix blog post indicate that AT&T customers expect a good quality Netflix experience  given how much they pay AT&T for their Internet service.  It is free and easy for AT&T to interconnect  directly with Netflix and quickly improve their customers’ experience, should AT&T so desire.      Strong Net Neutrality: No-fee Interconnect    The Internet faces a long term threat from the largest ISPs driving up profits for themselves and costs for  everyone else as detailed in our recent blog post.     If the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined company’s footprint will pass  over 60 percent1 of U.S. broadband households, after the proposed divestiture, with most of those  homes having Comcast as the only option for truly high-speed broadband (>10Mbps).  As DSL fades in  favor of cable Internet, Comcast could control high-speed broadband to the majority of American                                                   1  Adam Ilkowitz,” Surprise! Comcast Takes TWC,” Nomura Securities, February 13, 2014  6  homes.  Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit  providers and services such as Netflix.  The combined company would possess even more anti- competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers.  For this  reason, Netflix opposes this merger.  Competition    In Q1, Amazon changed strategies in the UK and Germany, closing LoveFilm as a streaming brand to  compete with Netflix.  They have repurposed their content deals to serve Amazon Prime Instant Video in  the UK and Germany, and are investing in creating awareness of this new model.  Amazon is not  currently offering subscription video within Prime in Canada, France, Italy, Spain or Japan. They may  choose to expand Prime Instant Video or to focus on tuning their three existing Prime Instant Video  markets: U.S., UK and Germany.  Since much of the content on Netflix and Amazon Prime (as well as  Hulu in the U.S.) is mutually exclusive, many consumers see value in subscribing to all three networks.      In general, we continue to believe that our biggest long-term competitor for entertainment time  remains the MVPDs improving through TV Everywhere, as they are doing with HBO Go.     6.7 Million DVD Memberships    Our DVD-by-mail business continues to delight 6.7 million members.  As expected, contribution profit  for the segment was $98 million in the quarter and we anticipate $92 million for Q2.  The breadth of  content choices available on DVD and Blu-ray is unrivaled.          7  Summary  We are approaching 50 million global members, but that is far short of HBO’s 130 million.  We are eager  to close the gap.

      "We are off to a great start in 2016, expanding the Netflix service to 130 new countries in January and finishing Q1 with over 81 million members on the strength of our fast growing slate of original content. Since 2010, we have offered unlimited streaming for $7.99 per month in the US, and we hope to maintain this affordable entry-price for a long time. As we’ve made vast improvements in our service and content, consumers see even more value and our membership grows. Q1 was no exception and our summary results are below. Q1 Results Net additions in Q1 ‘16 amounted to a record 6.74 million, surpassing our prior high water mark of 5.59 million in Q4 ‘15 and against 4.88 million in the year-ago period. Of our 81.5 million members, 42% are now outside of the US. Operating income was $49 million vs. $97 million in the year ago quarter, as we continue to invest in international markets. Performance in the quarter benefited from the launch of several series, including Making a Murderer (a ​ ​ late December debut), Fuller House (February), House of Cards Season 4 (March) and Daredevil Season 2 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (March), complemented by a diverse mix of new films, documentaries, series and kids shows available globally. In the US, we added 2.23 million members in Q1, against 2.28 million a year ago, and 2.25 two years ago. Our forecast for the quarter was low (at 1.75 million) because we underestimated the positive acquisition impact of our major original content debuts. US revenue rose 18% year-over-year, reflecting 14% growth in average paid memberships and a 3% increase in ARPU. US contribution profit totaled $413 million, or a 35.5% margin, compared to 31.7% a year ago. International revenue increased 57% year-over-year, including the negative impact of currency (-$82 million on a y/y basis). Excluding F/X, international ARPU rose 7% year-over-year. Our Q1 international contribution loss of $104 million came in better than forecast due to the timing of content spend. Our established markets around the world are all growing, and in early Q1 we added 130 more countries. By expanding broadly at once, we are learning more quickly about how best to please consumers across a wide variety of cultures and markets. In most of these markets, so far, Netflix is offered only in English and payment methods are limited primarily to international credit cards. In the coming quarters, we will add more local languages, content, payment options and customer support. We are pleased Netflix is finding acceptance around the world. Consumers worldwide are delighted to be able to enjoy our original and exclusive series and films instantaneously. We have lots of work to do to make Netflix more relevant market by market, but the opportunity is amazing. Q2 Forecast As a reminder, the guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For the second quarter, we expect to add 2.5 million members with 0.5 million in the US and 2.0 million internationally (versus prior year 2.4 million). In the US, our Q2 net adds forecast of 0.5 million is in-line with prior years (0.5, 0.6, 0.6, and 0.9 million from 2012-2015), taking into account a modest impact from the beginning of un-grandfathering. 2Our international forecast for fewer net adds than prior year is due to a tough comparison against the Australia/New Zealand launch. The ANZ growth spike in Q2 last year resulted in international Q2 net adds more than doubling year over year (from 1.12 million to 2.37 million). While ANZ is growing steadily this Q2, it is less than the launch spike last year. Ex-ANZ, international net adds would be forecast up this quarter. International net adds are down sequentially both due to standard seasonality and our launch in 130 countries at very beginning of Q1 (so Q1 captured the initial surge of sign-ups). In the US, we are forecasting flat Y/Y contribution margin in Q2, due to a large slate of content releases and associated marketing. We expect strong y/y margin growth to resume in Q3 and we remain on track to achieve our 40% US contribution margin target by 2020. We expect Q2 international contribution loss to improve sequentially primarily due to recent favorable currency movements. We anticipate that international contribution losses in the second half of 2016 will be similar to the first half, as ongoing investments offset improved profitability in our more mature markets. On China, we are continuing discussions but have no material update on our approach or timing. Whatever we do will have only a modest financial effect in the near term. With respect to un-grandfathering, currently, more than half of our US members pay only $7.99 or $8.99 for our $9.99 HD 2-screen plan. We will phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest-tenured members getting the longest benefit. To reinforce brand trust, we won’t change anyone’s price without their acknowledgement of the new price in their member experience, where they will see a dialogue box about their options. Members can choose our $7.99 SD 1-screen plan, our $9.99 HD 2-screen plan or our $11.99 UHD 4-screen plan. We are rolling this out slowly over the year, rather than mostly in May, so we can learn as we go. Most of our grandfathered members are in the US, but we’ll take the same approach internationally. We expect only modestly increased churn from un-grandfathering, partially because these members have been with us for a reasonable period already, and because our content continues to improve. The increase in ARPU will allow us to invest more in content next year, and we are taking up our expected spend from about $5B in 2016 to over $6B on a P&L basis in 2017 (more on a cash basis). Content In Q1, we had our most ambitious slate of content releases to date. Since the February 19th premiere of Judd Apatow's Love, we have debuted at least one new show or feature film every single week of the ​ ​ quarter. This includes five new seasons of original series as well as several original feature films, documentaries, kids shows and stand-up specials. We launched the second season of Marvel’s Daredevil ​ and the fourth season of House of Cards to strong critical reviews. ​ ​ ​ ​ In addition to stepping up the pace, we’re also broadening our programming to appeal to a large global membership base with diverse tastes. We expanded into the multi-camera sitcom format in Q1 with Fuller House, a family comedy that met with overwhelmingly positive viewer reception. Fuller House, ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 3and the late Q4 release of true crime documentary Making a Murderer, are excellent examples of how ​ ​ Netflix is breaking through the cultural zeitgeist and how our portfolio of original content continues to be a great driver of membership growth for Netflix. We are maintaining a fast pace of content launches in Q2, starting with the recently released sitcom The ​ Ranch, starring Ashton Kutcher. We’ll launch seven new seasons of original series, including ​ Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Grace and Frankie and Orange is the New Black. We will also ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ premiere the original films The Do-Over, Adam Sandler’s second film for Netflix, Special Correspondents ​ ​ ​ featuring Ricky Gervais and Eric Bana, The Fundamentals of Caring, starring Paul Rudd and Brahman ​ ​ ​ Naman from the maverick Indian director Q. ​ Q2 will also mark our initial foray into the talk show genre with Chelsea, starring Chelsea Handler. This ​ ​ talk show will be a bit of a departure from the normal “all episodes at once” model of our other originals. Chelsea will premiere new episodes nightly, three nights per week, shortly after the show is ​ ​ recorded in front of a live audience and will incorporate stylistic elements from her well-received Netflix documentary series Chelsea Does. We are excited to bring Chelsea Handler and this new show to our ​​ ​​ global platform that opens up our original content offering to include more topical programming that merges our already successful comedy and documentary efforts. Our investment in original content for kids and families has helped make Netflix a destination for great creators of live action and animated television. Our original series were nominated for 33 Daytime Emmy nominations across 7 of our original shows, including All Hail King Julien, Project MC2 and ​ ​ ​ ​ Dragons: Race to The Edge. In Q2, we are releasing nine new seasons of original series for kids including ​ Kong: King of The Apes and a re-boot of Voltron. ​ ​ ​ With our footprint now virtually global, Netflix is uniquely positioned to bring stories from all over the world to people all over the world. We’ve stepped up production of non-English language series following up on last year’s success of Club de Cuervos from Mexico and Narcos, which was filmed in ​ ​ ​ ​ Colombia in Spanish and English. Our first French series Marseille, a political drama starring Gerard ​ ​ Depardieu, premieres globally on May 5, while our new Japanese original series Hibana premieres ​ ​​ globally in June. We are also working on 3% in Brazil, Suburra in Italy, Dark in Germany, an ​ ​ ​ ​​ ​ ​ as-yet-untitled period series in Spain, a second season of Club De Cuervos and our second Mexican ​ ​​ original series, Ingobernable, starring Kate Del Castillo in Mexico, as well as our first fully global original ​ ​ ​​ Japanese anime series Perfect Bones. These series help both to cement the popularity and relevance of ​ ​​ Netflix in the territories where they originate and, in success, will reach a broad global audience. We are investing about 5% of our cash content budget in original films. As we learn, we may spend beyond that, once we’ve established that new, fully-exclusive movies debuting on Netflix creates more consumer excitement and member viewing than the territory-by-territory licensing of nine-month-old “Pay One” movies that are also available on TVOD and DVD. Upcoming original films in the second half of 2016 include War Machine, a satirical comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by David Michod, and ​ ​ Mascots, the latest ensemble comedy from Christopher Guest. Our 2017 lineup includes Bong Joon-Ho’s ​ ​​ Okja, and Bright, an epic action film starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer. ​ ​ ​ 4The release schedule for our announced upcoming original content can be found on our PR site. ​ ​ To highlight the expansion of our original content offering, we recently hosted an event in Paris for press and influencers from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Below is a photo of Kevin Spacey and Ted Sarandos, surrounded by our titles, before a large audience. Product At Netflix, we strive to deliver the best video experience for our members and picture quality is an important element of this. In 2014, we began streaming in 4K with the debut of House of Cards Season ​ ​ 2. Today, we have one of the largest catalogues of 4K content available, with the number of 4K titles increasing 10x since inception. Not surprisingly, streaming of 4K content is growing as a share of total viewing. We are also continuing to push the boundaries of visual impact and we're excited about High Dynamic Range (HDR). While 4K offers more pixels, HDR provides greater depth with brighter highlights and a wider color range. Today, you can experience HDR on Netflix with Season One of Marco Polo, if you have ​ ​ an HDR-enabled TV and subscribe to our 4-screen UHD plan. We are expanding our HDR content catalogue rapidly. It wasn't too long ago that online video was associated with grainy images and constant buffering. But today, the Internet, not cable or broadcast distribution, is actually home to the cutting edge of video quality and it will only get better from here as Internet TV replaces linear television. 5We started rolling out new and more efficient encodes during Q1, offering either 20% savings in data, or a commensurate increase in quality, depending on whether a consumer is bandwidth-limited or not. This will be reflected in our ISP speed index reports as a small reduction in average bitrate across all ISPs, but most of the value is realized in improved quality for our customers. We are now turning our attention to mobile-specific encodes, with a desire to deliver better video at lower bandwidth to these devices, which are increasingly important in our newest markets. Partnerships Similar to our content portfolio, our partnerships have expanded in scope over the years, growing in importance with the launch of our service across the world. Originally focused on consumer electronics device integration, Netflix partnerships now span a wide array of relationships with pay TV and mobile operators, Internet service providers, mobile device and set top box manufacturers, and brick and mortar retailers (gift cards). We integrate Netflix to make it easier for members to sign up, access and pay for the service. In addition, our partners benefit through customer acquisition, the opportunity to upsell higher value packages of speed/data/content, lower churn and increases in brand affinity. Recently, Canadian operator Telus said: \"Nearly half of Optik TV customers are also Netflix subscribers. Making Netflix available was a simple but powerful innovation to make our customers’ entertainment experience better, and far easier. Not only has this driven deeper engagement with our Optik customers who have Netflix, these same customers are actually consuming more content on Optik, including more on demand content, than ever before.” As Internet TV grows, it is exciting to be a part of a vibrant ecosystem driving innovation and value for consumers all over the world. Competition If you think about your last 30 days, and analyze the evenings you did not watch Netflix, you can understand how broad our competition really is. Whether you played video games, surfed the web, watched a DVD, TVOD, or linear TV, wandered through YouTube, read a book, streamed Hulu or Amazon, or pirated content (hopefully not), you can see the market for relaxation time and disposable income is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea. For example, while we’ve grown from zero to 47 million members in the USA, HBO has also grown, which shows how large the entertainment market is. We earn a tiny fraction of consumers’ time and money, and have lots of opportunity ahead to win more of your evenings away from all those other activities if we can keep improving. 6Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure At the end of Q1, we had cash and equivalents totaling $2.1 billion. In Q1, free cash flow was -$261 million, compared with -$276 million in Q4 ‘15. As we have written in the past, our investment in original programming (particularly owned content) is more cash intensive upfront, resulting in a timing-driven gap between net income and free cash flow. We currently have $2.4 billion of long term debt. With our low debt to enterprise value of 5%, our plan is to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016 or in early 2017. Given the attractiveness of our business model in a growth area relative to other large cap companies, as well as our low debt to EV ratio, investors view our bonds as quite secure; they trade better than the BB index, despite our single B credit rating, (but not yet as well as ​ ​ media firms like Viacom or Discovery). Over time, the ratings agencies may catch up to the buyside in ​ ​ ​ ​ their views of the credit risk for Netflix. DVD Our DVD service ended Q1 with 4.7M members and $72M in contribution profit.

IR Contact: PR Contact: Spencer Wang Jonathan Friedland Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations Chief Communications Officer 408 809-5360 310 734-2958 Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves, and to free cash flow and EBITDA. ​ ​ Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are 7important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.  However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding investments in international markets; localization of our  service; expansion to China and the financial impact of such expansion; end of grandfathered pricing and  its impact on churn and ARPU; price change process; content spending; future content offerings; original  content strategy; product developments such as HDR content and encode efficiency improvements;  future capital raises and timing of such raises; member growth domestically and internationally,  including net, total and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both  domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income,  net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer  usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,  competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and  events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers.  Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on  risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no  obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the  date of this shareholder letter.  8                                                                                                                                                          9 Netflix, Inc.

      "Fellow shareholders,    In Q1, we surpassed $2.5 billion in quarterly streaming revenue and added 5 million members.  The  opportunity provided to us by the growth of the global internet is gigantic and our plan is to keep  investing as we increase membership, revenue and operating margins.           1  Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast   The quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report, and we strive for  accuracy. In Q1, there were no substantial variations from our January guidance forecast.   Due to content (primarily ​House of Cards ​season 5) moving from Q1 to Q2, we had higher operating  margins in Q1 (as forecasted) at 9.7% than our plan for the year (about 7%).  We forecast operating  margin at 4.4% in Q2, placing us on track to reach our 7% target for the full year.   The other effect of the content moves is lower net adds in Q1 compared to prior year (as expected) and  heavier net adds in Q2 compared to prior year (about double).  We have come to see these quarterly  variances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV. For the first half of  this year, for example, we expect to have 8.15 million net adds, compared to 8.42 million net adds in the  first half last year.   International net additions decreased 22% year over year, as we lapped our January 2016 launch of over  130 countries, and the accompanying early surge demand, in Q1 2016. Revenue for the international  segment grew 62% year over year, excluding a -$12 million impact from currency, while ASP rose 12%  year over year on a F/X neutral basis. Q1 was the first quarter of consolidated profit for our international  segment as profit growth in our more mature territories offset investments in newer markets.  Our  forward guidance shows that we intend to continue to invest internationally, projecting a small loss for  Q2.  We have high satisfaction and are rapidly growing in Latin America, Europe, and North America. We are  making good strides in improving our content offering to match local tastes in Asia, Middle East, and  Africa, but have much progress to make, like in Latin America a few years ago.   Our year-over-year streaming revenue growth is benefiting from a price change in mid 2016, and will  moderate over the course of the year to track membership growth more closely. We are seeing a small  but steady migration to our 4-stream, 4K-UHD-HDR video quality tier, which is our high end plan. That  will keep revenue growth slightly above membership growth, holding F/X constant.   For the last several years we’ve had flat operating margins due to established markets funding  international expansion with every spare dollar we had. Because of that, the major indicators of our  progress were member and revenue growth and US contribution margins. Starting this year, we can be  primarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics. The  summary table above has been reorganized to reflect that, while maintaining comparability to the past.   Content  With a growing member base spread across the world, we seek to please diverse tastes with a wide  breadth of content. The key releases this past quarter highlight this range of programming: ​A Series of  Unfortunate Events​, a dark comedy for the entire family, ​Santa Clarita Diet​, a “zom-com” starring Drew  Barrymore and ​Ultimate Beastmaster​, our first competition show which pits athletes from around the  globe against a fearsome 600-foot obstacle course.  2  In addition to these titles, on March 17, we debuted ​Marvel’s Iron Fist​, which has quickly become  another highly viewed Marvel series, and sets the stage for ​The Defenders​, which brings together all the  characters from the Marvel series later this year. A week later, we launched ​Ingobernable​, our second  Mexican series, starring Kate del Castillo, which has been very popular in Mexico. On the last day of Q1,  we unveiled ​13 Reasons Why​. Below is global search volume for several of our big launches over the last  year.      We have also stepped up our investment in stand up comedy which we believe can help grow our  business, like our original series. Early results are promising; the triumphant return of a comedy legend  in ​Dave Chappelle: Collection 1​ was our most viewed comedy special ever. We are also finding this to be  true in international markets as well, with comedian Gad Elmaleh’s ​Gad Gone Wild​, a breakout hit in  France last quarter.  Just ahead of the release of our third film from Adam Sandler, ​Sandy Wexler​, we announced the renewal  of our deal with Sandler to premiere an additional four films exclusively on Netflix around the world. We  continue to be excited by our Sandler relationship and our members continue to be thrilled with his  films. Since the launch of ​The Ridiculous 6​, Netflix members have spent more than half a billion hours  enjoying the films of Adam Sandler.   We recently hired ​Scott Stuber​ to lead our original films initiative. Our goal remains the same: to offer a  variety of new movies that will attract and delight members at better economics relative to licensing  movies under traditional windowing. Some of our early movies have been successful by this measure,  such as the Sandler movies and ​Siege of Jadotville​. Others, such as ​Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon:  Sword of Destiny​, have not.  Scott’s mandate is to increase both the portfolio and the percentage of  films that delight many of our members relative to the film’s cost.   3  Since our members are funding these films, they should be the first to see them. But we are also open to  supporting the large theater chains, such as AMC and Regal in the US, if they want to offer our films,  such as our upcoming Will Smith film ​Bright​, in theatres simultaneous to Netflix. Let consumers choose.   Product  As always, our product team has dozens of tests running in the endless quest for even higher member  satisfaction. One test that won conclusively last year and has now been rolled out to all members is our  new “thumbs-up thumbs-down” feedback model, replacing the 5-star model we have had from our DVD  days. The amount of usage we get with this new approach is over twice as many ratings.  With this  additional personal input, we’ll be able to improve personalization, making your front screen on Netflix  even more relevant.   A multi-year effort ahead is to have video replace still images in our user experience in ways that please  our members and help them choose what to watch. Video for choosing video is an obvious direction, but  doing it well through our interface takes judgment, creativity, and testing.  In April, we will add Thai and later in the quarter, Romanian and Hebrew, to the 24 languages we  currently support.   Marketing  As our slate of content expands, we’ll spend over $1 billion in 2017 marketing our content to drive  member acquisition. As part of this, we are investing more in programmatic advertising with the aim of  improving our ability to do individualized marketing at scale and to deliver the right ad to the right  person at the right time. Buttressing this activity is the substantial earned media coverage around the  Netflix brand, technology and content we generate globally through events and activities aimed at  journalists and social media influencers. We also market our content extensively to members through  our service and with our partners. For instance, we participated in Comcast’s Watchathon in April,  providing X1 subscribers unlimited access to Netflix for a week.   Competition  Our investors often ask us about ecosystem change, such as the advent in the US of virtual MVPDs (like  Sling, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, YouTube TV and Hulu’s forthcoming service). We believe VMVPDs  will likely be more directly competitive to existing MVPD services since they offer a subset of the same  channels at $30-$60 per month, and may appeal to a segment of the population that doesn’t subscribe  to a pay TV bundle. But we don’t think it will have much of an impact on us as Netflix is largely  complementary to pay TV packages. Our focus also is on on-demand, commercial free viewing rather  than live, ad-supported programming.   Additionally, investors ask us about Amazon’s move into NFL football.  That is not a strategy that we  think is smart for us since we believe we can earn more viewing and satisfaction from spending that  money on movies and TV shows.   4  Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow in Q1’17 was -$423 million vs. -$261 million in the year ago quarter and an improvement  from -$639 million in Q4’16. The growth in our original content means we continue to plan to have  around $2B in negative FCF this year.   We have a large market opportunity ahead of us and we’re optimizing long-term FCF by growing our  original content aggressively. Negative near-term FCF is the result of the big increases in our original  content, combined with small but growing operating margins. Since we want our operating margins to  grow slowly so we can spend enough to quickly grow revenue and original content, we anticipate  negative FCF to accompany our rapid growth for many years. Our operating margins are our key  indicator of improving global profitability; they are already growing and we plan to keep them growing  for many years ahead. Eventually, at a much larger revenue base, original content and revenue growth  will be slower, and we anticipate substantial positive FCF, like our media peers.  Our debt to total cap ratio, at under 10%, is quite conservative compared to most of our media peers at  30-70%, and conservative compared to efficient capital structure theory. Thus we will continue to add  long-term debt as needed to finance our expansion of original content, including in Q2’17.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: ​January 2017​, ​October 2016​, ​July 2016​,  April 2016​, ​January, 2016​, ​October 2015​, ​July 2015​, ​April 2015​.      Summary  We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity in front of us to build a truly global and durable  internet TV business.  We expect to cross the 100 million member mark this weekend. It’s a good start.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding the company’s business opportunity, balancing  contribution profit and investment in the service, localization efforts, operating margins, plans to invest  in growth; product initiatives; marketing spend; impacts on our business from competition; localization  efforts; content strategy, including local content, original and licensed content investments; use of  capital; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue;  contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income,  earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should  anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to  update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.    6      7 Netflix, Inc.

      "We achieved several major milestones in Q1: surpassing 40 million members in the US; 20 million internationally; and 60 million in total. Our original series, documentaries and comedy specials are being enthusiastically received, and member engagement is at an all-time high. Members streamed 10 billion hours in Q1, more evidence that consumers around the world are embracing the Internet TV revolution. *Q1'15 EPS would have been $0.77 excluding a F/X lloss. Q4'14 Net Income/EPS includes a $39m / $0.63 benefit from a tax accrual release related to resolution of tax audit **Corresponds to our total known streaming content oobligations as defined in our financial statements and related notes in our most recently filed SEC Form 10-K 1                    2    Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast  We added a record 4.9 million new members globally in Q1, against our forecast of 4.1 million and prior  year of 4.0 million, bringing our total global streaming membership to 62.3 million. In the US, we gained  2.3 million new members, well above our expectation of 1.8 million due to both acquiring and retaining  more members than forecast.  Internationally, we added 2.6 million members versus a forecast of 2.25  million due to stronger growth than expected across a number of markets.   As a reminder, the quarterly  guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.   We think strong US growth benefited from our ever-improving content, including the launch of the third  season of House of Cards and new shows Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Bloodline.  In addition,  retention continued to improve due to the growing value of our service overall.  We are forecasting Q2  US net adds of 0.6 million, similar to the year ago quarter.  During Q1, higher-than-forecast net adds and US revenue, coupled with lower-than-forecast content  spending, resulted in a US contribution margin of 31.7%, ahead of our 30.1% estimate.  In 2015, we  expect to run ahead of our US contribution margin growth target of 200 bps/year on average because a  greater share of global and original content costs will be absorbed by existing and new international  territories as we continue to expand globally (since we allocate global content costs by geography).    In addition, starting in Q2 we intend to shift some of our US marketing budget to international to take  advantage of the substantial available growth opportunities. This, in the short term, drives down  international contribution profits and drives up US contribution profits.  We are still targeting 40%  contribution margin in the US in 2020.  Our international segment was fueled by continued strong growth across our 50+ countries as well as a  successful March 24 launch in Australia and New Zealand, which adds about 8 million1 broadband  households to our addressable market.  In ANZ, Netflix benefited from high consumer awareness, a  fervent fan base for original series like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and operator  relationships with Optus and iiNet, the second and third largest broadband providers.  We expect  international Q2 net adds of 1.90 million, up 70% vs. last year. Later in 2015, we will launch additional  markets, starting with Japan.   The strong dollar hurt financial results during the quarter, negatively affecting International segment  revenue (lower by $48 million y/y using Q1 2014 forex rates) which carried through into a $15M  negative forex impact on international contribution loss.  These forex headwinds offset better than  expected subscriber growth to result in contribution losses close to our expectations.  As a reminder, we  absorbed on average 5% higher VAT rates across our European markets starting January 1.  We’ll have a  full quarter of content expenses in ANZ in Q2 and expect the international segment loss to grow to $101  million, increasing throughout the back half of 2015 as we expand to additional markets (consistent with  what we’ve said).  Our strong performance led to overall operating income that exceeded our projections ($97m actual  versus $79m forecast). Net income was negatively affected by currency-related transaction losses                                                              1 SNL Kagan                      3  included in other expense; excluding these forex losses, Q1 EPS would have been $0.77 vs. our $0.60  forecast and our actual EPS of $0.38.  Content  Our original content strategy is playing out as we hoped, driving lots of viewing in an economic way for  Netflix while bolstering the positive perception of our brand and service around the world.  House of Cards, in its third season, had its biggest launch yet in terms of viewers. Unbreakable Kimmy  Schmidt, Tina Fey’s return to television, has been a hit, winning Rotten Tomatoes scores of 90%+ from  both critics and viewers and our drama thriller, Bloodline starring Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn and  Sissy Spacek, is performing on par with the first seasons of our other big drama shows. During the  quarter, we announced new seasons for all three shows, as well as three new Netflix original films, Pee- Wee’s Big Holiday from Judd Apatow and Paul Reubens, Jadotville, from Irish director Richie Smyth and  starring Jamie Dornan, and Beasts of No Nation from director Cary Fukunaga and starring Idris Elba.  Beasts will premiere on Netflix later this year.   We are delighted by the fan excitement and critical response around last Friday’s launch of Marvel’s  Daredevil, the first of four series and a mini-series from our deal with Marvel Entertainment. The current  quarter will also see the debut of Grace and Frankie starring legendary comedians Jane Fonda and Lily  Tomlin, Sense8, an unbelievably cinematic and entertaining global dramatic thriller from the Wachowski  siblings, and the third season of our groundbreaking Orange is The New Black.

Marketing  We are increasingly spending on the promotion of our original content rather than emphasizing  attributes of the Netflix brand and service that are now more familiar to consumers. Early tests in  international markets suggest this content focus is aiding member acquisition.  We are also spending a bigger proportion of our marketing dollars online. This allows us to more finely  target audiences and to deliver the right marketing message to the right person at the right time,  particularly on mobile devices.  Product  We plan to roll out an improvement to our TV UI in the second half of 2015. The enhancement will bring  video playback forward into the browse experience. We are also developing improved ways to promote  Netflix originals to our members, using our data to help identify which members would be most likely to  enjoy each original title. Given our international rollout, we continue to add subtitles and UI languages  for much of our content.   Over the next year we’ll evolve from using HTTP to using Secure HTTP (HTTPS) while browsing and  viewing content on our service.   This helps protect member privacy, particularly when the network is  insecure, such as public wifi, and it helps protect members from eavesdropping by their ISP or employer,  who may want to record our members’ viewing for other reasons.                        4  Strong Net Neutrality  We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access  they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at  interconnection points. In the US, we have been vocal advocates for, and are pleased with, recent action  by the FCC to assure an open and neutral Internet under its Title II authority.  In particular, we applaud  the FCC for specifically addressing interconnection points. We hope this action serves as an example to  regulators around the world looking to strengthen the innovative force of the Internet.  Data caps inhibit Internet innovation and are bad for consumers. In Australia, we recently sought to  protect our new members from data caps by participating in ISP programs that, while common in  Australia, effectively condone discrimination among video services (some capped, some not). We should  have avoided that and will avoid it going forward. Fortunately, most fixed-line ISPs are raising or  eliminating data caps in line with our belief that ISPs should provide great video for all services in a  market and let consumers do the choosing.  Competition  In the US, HBO began offering its $15 per month “HBO Now” service last week. As we have said in the  past, Netflix and HBO are not substitutes for one another given differing content. We think both will  continue to be successful in the marketplace, as illustrated by the fact that HBO has continued to grow  globally and domestically as we have rapidly grown over the past 5 years.    We view “Internet MVPD” offerings like the rumored Apple offering, Sony’s Playstation Vue and Dish’s  Sling TV as more competitive to the current pay TV bundle than to Netflix which is lower cost, has  exclusive and original content, and is not focused on live television.  Piracy remains a considerable long-term threat, mostly outside the US.  DVD  Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to delight more than 5.5 million members and provided  $85 million in contribution profit in Q1.  The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and  TV shows, remains appealing to a core user base and means that the tail on this business should be  quite long.  Free Cash Flow & Capital  During the quarter, free cash flow totaled -$163 million, a step up from Q4 reflecting our growing  original content investment.  In February, we issued $1.5 billion in debt at a weighted average interest  rate of 5.7%, split between 7 and 10 year notes. We ended Q1 with $3.0 billion in cash & equivalents  and short term investments. We will continue to invest aggressively in original content which is cash  intensive.   As we’ve said, our plan is to run around break-even globally through 2016, and to then deliver material  global profits in 2017 and beyond.      5  Stock Split  As highlighted in our preliminary proxy, we are seeking shareholder approval for an increase in our  authorized shares. If approved, we expect to recommend to our Board a stock split to make our stock  more accessible.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: January 2015, October 2014, July 2014,  April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013.  Summary  We are excited to see Internet TV catch hold across the world. We are at one of those wonderful  moments when technology intersects with storytelling to create more choice and value for consumers.  It’s great to be at the vanguard and we appreciate your support.  Sincerely,  Reed Hastings, CEO  David Wells, CFO  April 15th, 2015 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview today at 3 p.m.  Pacific Time at youtube.com/netflixir.  The discussion will be moderated by Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital  Markets and Michael Nathanson, MoffettNathanson Research.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis  excluding foreign currency and the release of tax reserves provides useful information as these  measures exclude effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes  that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the  amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain  other activities.  However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a  substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash  provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.   Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding US contribution margin growth; international expansion,  deployment of marketing funds; content launches; product improvements; agreements with ISPs;  impact of competition; stock split; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total  and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and  DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per  share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on January 29, 2015.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should  anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and                      7  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to  update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                                  8 Netflix, Inc.

      "As expected, revenue growth accelerated 400 basis points to 26%, and operating income increased 53% year over year in Q2. Paid membership grew by 2.7m, less than the 5.5m in Q2 a year ago and our 5.0m forecast. In Q3, we expect to grow by 7m paid memberships, more than the 6.1m in Q3 a year ago. Consumers around the world continue to move from linear television to internet entertainment at a remarkable rate. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Average streaming paid memberships increased 24% year over year, while ARPU increased 3% year over year on a reported basis. Excluding the year over year foreign exchange (F/X) impact on revenue of -$265 million, global streaming ARPU grew 9%, with 12% and 7% ARPU growth in the US and international segments, respectively. Operating margin of 14.3% (up 250 bps year over year) was higher than our beginning-of-quarter forecast as some marketing spend was shifted into the second half of the year. EPS amounted to $0.60 vs. $0.85 and included a $61 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming content obligations decreased 2% sequentially, reflecting our shift to more owned (vs. licensed) content. 1As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We strive for accuracy (not conservatism), which means that in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance. In Q2’19, our membership growth forecast was high. Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases. We don’t believe competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape during Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our over-forecast was in every region). Rather, we think Q2’s content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated. Additionally, Q1 was so large for us (9.6m net adds), there may have been more pull-forward effect than we realized. In prior quarters with over-forecasts, we’ve found that the underlying long-term growth was not affected and staying focused on the fundamentals of our business served us well. Q3 has started with Stranger Things season 3, and the first two weeks of Q3 are strong. In addition to ​ ​ the recently released season 3 of Stranger Things, our second half content slate includes new seasons of ​ ​ La Casa de Papel (Money Heist), The Crown, and the final season of the iconic Orange is the New Black as ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ well as big films like The Irishman from Martin Scorsese and action movie 6 Underground (directed by ​ ​ ​ ​ Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds). While our US paid membership was essentially flat in Q2, we expect it to return to more typical growth in Q3, and are seeing that in these early weeks of Q3. We forecast Q3 global paid net adds of 7.0m, up vs. 6.1m in Q3’18, with 0.8m in the US and 6.2m internationally. Our internal forecast still currently calls for annual global paid net adds to be up year over year. There’s no change to our 13% operating margin target for FY19, up 300 basis points year over year. 2Content Our Q2 content slate featured several highly watched titles. We launched Dead to Me, a dramedy ​ ​ starring 2019 Emmy nominated Best Actress Christina Applegate, which was watched by 30m households in its first four weeks. We’ve renewed this half hour comedy for a second season. We’re also proud of When They See Us, a moving limited series based on the Central Park Five case, from Ava ​ ​ DuVernay. This powerful story was watched by 25m households in its first four weeks and has stirred a global conversation about race, identity, and criminal justice. When They See Us was also just nominated ​ ​ for 16 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Limited Series. Our Planet was our most ambitious ​ ​ undertaking in the documentary category to date and it’s also our highest-watched original docu-series through its first four weeks (33m households) and was just nominated for 10 Emmy Awards. We are making good progress with our original films portfolio with more and more of our films creating larger audiences than our pay 1 licensed movies. At the end of June, we premiered our latest Adam Sandler movie Murder Mystery (also starring Jennifer Aniston), which is the most watched Adam Sandler ​ ​ Netflix original film to date; over 73m households watched this film in its first four weeks. In Q2, the young adult romantic comedy movie The Perfect Date (featuring Noah Centineo from our big film To All ​ ​ ​ The Boys I’ve Loved Before) was a global hit with 48m households in its first four weeks. Similarly, Ali ​ Wong co-starred with Randall Park in Always Be My Maybe (directed by Nahnatchka Khan), which was ​ ​ viewed by 32m households in its first four weeks. Season 2 of The Rain was among the largest returning seasons for one of our non-English language ​ ​ originals, while Swedish series Quicksand was a new show that was highly watched both locally and ​ ​ globally. We also debuted several local-language titles that were very popular in their home territories like the first two installments of the Historia de un Crimen franchise (Historia de un Crimen: Colosio and ​ ​ ​ ​ 3Historia de un Crimen: Colmenares) in Latin America, while Family Business was a breakthrough hit for us ​ ​ ​ in France. We’ve been moving our content from semi-exclusive catalog and 2nd-window unbranded content to branded exclusive 1st window original content for many years. Much of our domestic, and eventually global, Disney catalog, as well as Friends, The Office, and some other licensed content will wind down ​ ​ ​ ​ over the coming years, freeing up budget for more original content. We don’t have material viewing concentration as even our largest titles (that are watched by millions of members) account for only a low single digit percentage of streaming hours. From what we’ve seen in the past when we drop strong catalog content (Starz and Epix with Sony, Disney, and Paramount films, or 2nd run series from Fox, for example) our members shift over to enjoying our other great content. Forty of our original series, films and specials were nominated for 117 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy and Drama Series, Limited Series, Animated Series and Reality Series, as well as Variety, Children’s, short form and interactive programs. We are incredibly proud to offer best in class original programming in so many different forms. Marketing As Netflix has shifted to original content, our marketing has evolved to increasingly focus on launching our key titles to build excitement amongst existing and non-members. We’re continuing to invest in owned and earned media, where we can have strong, direct relationships with fans. We’re very excited to welcome Jackie Lee-Joe as our new CMO to help us take our marketing to the next level. ​ ​ We’re also building out our licensing and brand partnerships effort, which is optimizing for fan and viewer engagement over revenue maximization. For example, for the launch of Stranger Things season ​ ​ 3, we partnered with best-in-class brands like Coke, Nike, Burger King, and Baskin Robbins to build deep ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ connections with our fans. At E3, the largest video gaming event of the year, we announced a new Stranger Things mobile game, a ​ ​ game based on our upcoming new show Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (a prequel to the 1982 film), ​ ​ and a partnership with Epic Games, the developers of Fortnite. Like our other merchandising initiatives, ​ ​ these games are designed to build fandom for our titles and don’t signal a push into gaming as a new business for Netflix. Product and Partnerships We recently entered into a new partnership with AT&T in the US to integrate Netflix into their new set-top box. In the US, we now partner with a wide range of ISPs and MVPDs, including Comcast, DISH, Verizon, T-Mobile, Charter, and Altice, in addition to AT&T. After several months of testing, we’ve decided to roll out a lower-priced mobile-screen plan in India to complement our existing plans. We believe this plan, which will launch in Q3, will be an effective way to introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market where Pay TV ARPU is low (below $5). We will continue to learn more after launch of this plan. 4Competition Over the next 12 months, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, NBCU and others are joining Hulu, Amazon, BBC, Hotstar, YouTube, Netflix, and many others in offering streaming entertainment. The competition for winning consumers’ relaxation time is fierce for all companies and great for consumers. The innovation of streaming services is also drawing consumers to shift more and more from linear television to streaming entertainment. If you watch Our Planet on a new TV with Dolby Vision or HDR10, you will see ​ ​ why: the quality of streaming television is spectacular. In the US, our most developed market, we still only earn about 10% of consumers’ television time, and less of their mobile screen time, so we have much room for growth. We, like HBO, are advertising free. That remains a deep part of our brand proposition; when you read speculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be confident that this is false. We believe we will have a more valuable business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue and instead entirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q2’19 was -$544 million vs. -$518 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)1 totaled -$594 million vs. -$559 million in Q2’18. We’re still forecasting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion for the full year 2019 and expect improvement in 2020. From there, we’ll continue to reduce our free cash flow deficit as we intend to continue growing our member base, revenues, and operating margin, which provides a clear path towards positive FCF. In the meantime, our plan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments as we did in April. In our most recent round, we raised 10.5 year senior notes of 1.2 billion (3.875% coupon) and $900 million (5.375% € coupon).

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  6  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding future content offerings and evolution of our content  mix; marketing investments; factors impacting our marginal growth; impact of competition; new pricing  plans; remaining an advertising free service; future capital raises; US paid membership growth; US and  international streaming paid memberships, paid net additions, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin; consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net  income, and earnings per share; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer  usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,  competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and  events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC  on February 8, 2019. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that  actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed  above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A.

      "1  July 22, 2013          Dear Fellow Shareholders,    We have grown to nearly 30 million domestic members and 8 million international members.  Q2  streaming revenue was up 26% domestically and 155% internationally over prior year.     Our first set of Netflix Originals earned 14 Emmy Award nominations, including “House of Cards” for  Outstanding Drama Series.  This is the first time an Internet TV show has been nominated for top Emmy  awards.    We invite you to watch our live video interview at youtube.com/netflixir at 3pm Pacific today.  Summary Q2 Results & Q3 Guidance Midpoints                               2  Domestic Streaming  As the table above shows, we are generating steady growth in members, revenue, and contribution  profit.  Our content mix, streaming and user experiences are all getting better and devices and  bandwidth are improving. Countering this, competitors for consumer attention are also all improving,  and the risk of U.S. market saturation only grows as we do.  Given these competing forces, we are very  happy this year to be tracking slightly ahead of prior year in terms of net additions.     We generally expect net additions in Q2 to be lower than prior year Q2 due to increased net-add  seasonality as we grow.  This Q2, however, was an exception, we believe due to the launch of Arrested  Development.  This show already had a strong brand and fan base, generating a small but noticeable  bump in membership when we released it.  Other great shows don’t have that noticeable effect in their  first season because they are less established.   Our contribution margin has now grown faster than our target for several quarters (up 610 basis points  from Q2 2012 on a target of 400).  In addition to growing members at a faster rate than expected, our  outperformance is due to timing shifts on content deals and to a lesser degree just spending less on  content than expected.  We are growing domestic content spend significantly and plan to continue to do  so.  We’ve generally talked about how we’re focused on 100 bps of sequential quarterly expansion, and  how the lumpiness of content deals can make the q/q pattern somewhat irregular.  Going forward, we’ll  slightly modify the articulation of our target from “an average of 100 bps per quarter” to “400 bps per  year.”    In Q3, our guidance midpoint implies 130 bps of further margin expansion as we continue to run above  our target.  For Q4, we anticipate stepping up content spending even more, getting us closer to our 400  bps per year target.  We’ll keep targeting about 400 basis points of annual improvement into 2014 if we  keep growing net additions at 2012/2013 levels.    In the quarter, we allowed our broad content deal with MTV Networks to expire.  As we have said in the  past, it is our preference to license specific shows that our members love in an exclusive manner. While  the shows from Nickelodeon and Comedy Central came off our service, we introduced several new  shows from Disney Jr., The Cartoon Network and the HUB for kids, and great comedies like “The New  Girl” from Fox on July 1.  Viewing and retention remain strong.    TV Everywhere continues to steadily improve, with, for example, the HBO Go app now available on  AppleTV.    Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant Video continue to license some exclusive content and develop their own  Originals.  We have House of Cards and many others; Hulu has Battleground; and Amazon Prime Instant  Video will have Alpha House; all are quite good and quite different.  All three services are becoming  more distinct from one another, like HBO, Showtime and Starz are distinct from one another on linear  TV.  Of our “top 200” titles, Hulu is now at 36 titles and Amazon Prime Instant Video is at 68.  Now that  Hulu has more money to spend, content prices may rise further, but we have many multi-year deals in                        3  place to mitigate this.  Hulu and Amazon appear to have about the same amount of viewing, and Hulu  recently reported 4 million paying members.     International Streaming  Our International streaming segment saw membership growth in all markets.  Net additions a year ago  were boosted by our UK/Ireland launch, so we are very happy to match in Q2 the net additions of a year  ago given we had no new territory launch in the first half of this year.  As our guidance implies, we  expect Q3 net additions to be above Q3 of last year, bolstered in part by the launch of Netflix  Netherlands within the quarter.    In Latin America, we continued to see strong growth of new members in Brazil after our April price  change from 15 BRL to 17 BRL.  Prices update in August for grandfathered members but we expect a  relatively small impact.  Most prices in Brazil are rising due to substantial inflation.    Q2 international contribution loss was lower than expected due to slightly higher member growth and  lower than anticipated growth in content spending across multiple markets.  We plan to grow our  international content investments in Q3 slightly ahead of revenues.  This growth combined with the  losses associated with the launch of the Netherlands results in our guidance reflecting a q/q increase in  our combined international contribution loss.  Netherlands is about half the size of Canada, and is a good opportunity for us as we prepare for entry  into more markets.  We’ll continue to expand in 2014 based upon the progression of our existing  markets and on confidence in the expansion opportunities.    Originals  For years we have featured a broad selection of movies and TV series licensed from others, and we  continue to improve the quality of this offering while seeking to differentiate Netflix by licensing that  content exclusively. This licensed content accounts for the bulk of viewing and leads to a lot of member  enjoyment.     Over the last six months, our move into Original programming has begun to redefine Netflix in the eyes  of consumers. Our first five series -- Lilyhammer, House of Cards, Hemlock Grove, Arrested Development  Season 4, and Orange is the New Black  -- have engaged large audiences across our markets and are very  different, allowing us to broaden our overall reach with each new Original.     We assess the success of each Original by looking at viewing-to-date and estimated future viewing,  relative to cost. So far, we’ve ordered second seasons of all first season projects, which is quite unusual  and exciting for the fans of these shows.  We’d be delighted to produce a fifth season of Arrested  Development, if possible, given fan reaction.                           4  We are thrilled to have the Netflix Originals nominated for 14 Emmys, with House of Cards earning nine  nominations including Outstanding Drama, Arrested Development garnering three, and Hemlock Grove  two. We couldn’t be more proud and pleased for the series creators, actors, composers, designers and  others who are being recognized by their peers for the excellence of their storytelling on Netflix.    Later this month, we will premiere Mako Mermaids, a series aimed at teen audiences, while for the  remainder of 2013 we will launch the Ricky Gervais series Derek and season two of Lilyhammer,  followed by Turbo: F.A.S.T.(Fast Action Stunt Team), our first animated Original from DreamWorks  Animation.  We’re excited about our plans for 2014 and beyond as we premiere season two of House of  Cards, Hemlock Grove, and Orange is the New Black, and debut Sense 8, and multiple kids Originals from  DreamWorks Animation.    Beyond series, we will be expanding our Originals initiative to include broadly appealing feature  documentaries and stand-up comedy specials. Netflix has become a big destination for fans of these  much loved and often under-distributed genres.    We’ll continue to build on our initial success with Originals as we gain confidence in our ability to use  our judgment and data to find projects that our members will enjoy.   Based on the viewing trends we see with other similar television series, we are amortizing Originals on a  straight-line basis over the shorter of 4 years or the license period1.  We are in the early stages of  Originals and continue to monitor whether the viewing pattern is enough higher in the first few months  to have us amortize at a faster initial rate, and then to continue on a straight-line basis for the  remainder of the amortization period.  In terms of relative size, of the approximately $3 billion in  content library net book value we are amortizing, currently around 5% is for Originals.    Streaming Service Getting Better  Our Product Innovation teams greatly enhanced the features and delivery of our service during the  quarter, as well as improved discovery and merchandising of our content library.    During Q2, we rolled out a new streaming player platform to all partners and began work towards a  single UI to run across multiple devices that will be optimized for various input devices (voice  interactions, pointer, and left/right/up/down controllers).  The new platform and UI are optimized for  better performance and faster starts and allow us to increase the number of platforms on which we can  conduct AB testing for even more rapid innovation.     In Q2, we also continued to focus efforts on improving our recommendation algorithms to help our  members discover great content.  Our recommendation algorithms create a highly personalized                                                              1If a subsequent season is added, we extend the remaining amortization period by a year.                        5  experience for each of our streaming members, allowing them to easily find content they’ll love and  allowing us to optimize the utility of the content library.  Constant innovation in this important area  (more than ¾ of the hours streamed on Netflix come from personalized suggestions generated by our  recommendation algorithms) continues across a variety of dimensions.      We continue improving features which will facilitate social interaction among members by allowing  them to provide direct recommendations to one another, provide feedback about those  recommendations and to share them with mutual friends.    In Q3, we’ll be rolling out our profiles features which will allow households to have distinct “profiles” for  different members or viewing tastes within their home, enabling us to provide a much more  personalized experience for our members.    Our default $7.99 plan includes two simultaneous streams.  We added an additional plan, at $11.99, that  includes 4 simultaneous streams for the few large families that would otherwise need two separate  accounts and partition their TVs between the two accounts.  As expected, the take rate on this large  family plan is minimal.  Our default limit of two simultaneous streams keeps password sharing with non- household members to a minimum because it risks the account owner not being able to watch when  they want.       Marketing    With our new Watch Responsibly ads, we’ve sought to tell a fun and emotional story that ties  consumers to the Netflix brand and highlight attributes of our service that drive certain consumer  behaviors - like watching ahead, spoiling it for others, and marathon viewing.  We didn’t invent these  behaviors, but they’ve become associated with Netflix and highlight the fundamental changes in the way  consumers are enjoying TV series and movies.     We’ve also begun to shine an even more effective light on the great content available on Netflix,  particularly our Originals.  Each Original has been backed by distinctive marketing and promotional  campaigns that have served to increase awareness of our service and to trigger engagement among  both members and non-members. The publicity surrounding Originals has been very substantial and  generally very positive, leading in turn to improved perception of the quality of content on our service  and on the value we offer to members.                            6  DVD  The huge selection we offer on DVD continues to be a draw for over 7 million households.  DVD contribution profit declined 19% y/y, in line with the decline in member/revenues, as most of the  costs scale with member/shipment levels.  We continue to anticipate being able to maintain approximately the margins we’ve posted in the first  half of 2013 throughout the full year.  Consistent with our view in prior quarters, we don’t foresee USPS  service changes that will have a material negative impact upon us or our members over the next few  quarters.      Free Cash Flow & Capital  Free cash flow was +$13 million in Q2, a swing to positive reflecting the relatively fewer content  payments in the quarter and strong global profit growth.  Our investments in content, including  Originals, will continue to weigh on FCF relative to net income and thus our FCF trends.    In April, we converted the 2011 TCV $200 million convertible notes to the corresponding 2.3 million  shares as discussed in our Q1 letter.  Our sole remaining long-term debt is the $500 million notes we  raised in February, which is due in 2021.       We continue to have just over a $1 billion in cash and equivalents.                                              7  Business Outlook  For investor convenience we placed the midpoints of our guidance ranges in the table at the beginning  of this letter.  This does not make the midpoint the “goal”.  Our best estimate is we will be within the  ranges below.  The ranges below are our guidance.         Summary     We are thrilled to be pleasing more members than ever.     The world is moving from linear TV to Internet TV and Netflix is leading that evolution.    Sincerely,                        8                                        Reed Hastings, CEO                         David Wells, CFO                                                           Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Interview  Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, Chief Financial Officer David Wells and Chief Content  Officer Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview about the Company’s financial results and  business outlook at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The interview will be conducted by Rich Greenfield, BTIG  Research and Julia Boorstin, CNBC, with questions submitted via email or twitter.  Questions from  investors should be submitted to rgreenfield@btig.com /@RichBTIG or Julia.boorstin@nbcuni.com /  @JBoorstin.     The live broadcast will be at www.youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.      Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding meeting domestic contribution margin targets;  investments in content, particularly exclusive and original content; subscriber acquisition seasonality;  potential effects of competition and market saturation; international contribution margin and impacts  arising from expansion to the Netherlands; improvements to our service, including the rollout of profiles  and social features; content accounting for originals; business outlook for our DVD segment, including  contribution margins and the impact of USPS service changes; free cash flow and usage of cash; member  growth, including total and paid; revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming  and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the third  quarter of 2013.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in  service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our  service; competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013.  We undertake no obligation to update  forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                         10 Netflix, Inc.

      "We grew by 1.7m members in Q2 finishing with over 83 million members. This is below our forecast of 2.5m net new members and our prior year Q2 net additions of 3.3m. We are growing, but not as fast as we would like or have been. Disrupting a big market can be bumpy, but the opportunity ahead is as big as ever and we continue to improve every aspect of our business. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Our global member forecast for Q2 was 2.5m and we came in at 1.7m. Gross additions were on target, but churn ticked up slightly and unexpectedly, coincident with the press coverage in early April of our ​ ​ plan to un-grandfather longer tenured members and remained elevated through the quarter. We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering. Churn of members who were actually un-grandfathered is modest and conforms to our expectations. With our large subscriber base, slight variances in retention versus forecast can result in significant swings in net adds, particularly in a seasonally small net add quarter like Q2. While un-grandfathering and associated media coverage may moderate near-term membership growth, we believe that un-grandfathering will provide us with more revenue to invest in our content to satisfy members, thus driving long-term growth. Over the second half of this year, we’ll complete un-grandfathering. Our three-tier pricing (in the US: $7.99 SD, $9.99 HD, and $11.99 UHD) is working well for us and for new members, and our gross additions remain healthy. On earnings, we slightly under-forecast the quarter, ending Q2 with operating income of $70 million and net income of $41 million against a forecast of $47 million and $9 million with the variance largely due to lower-than-expected content and other costs. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and our goal is to be accurate, not conservative. Therefore, in some quarters, we may come in high versus our forecast and, in other quarters, we may come in low. In the US, our Q2 net additions were 0.16 million against a forecast of 0.50 million. US revenue rose 18% year over year with domestic ASP growing 4.5% year over year. As expected, US contribution margin at 34.3% expanded more moderately year over year, owing to the timing of content spend. In addition, marketing expenses rose sequentially in support of our growing slate of originals and business partnerships, which we expect to continue. As Internet TV rises in popularity, so do the SVOD offerings. In the US, for example, CBS All Access, Seeso, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, YouTube Red, and many others are all growing. Our view, however, is that we are all growing primarily against linear TV hours and that competition did not contribute materially to our miss in Q2. First, increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions rather than churn. Second, we experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April in Canada, where there has been no recent increase in SVOD competition but where un-grandfathering is also underway. Similarly, we don’t believe market saturation is a key factor in the US given that we experienced similar performance over the same period in multiple countries with differing levels of Netflix market penetration. 2Our global membership forecast for Q3 includes an impact from the spectacle of the Olympics, on par  with what we experienced four years ago, and does not include any boost in the US from the Comcast  X1 launch due to uncertainty on timing as we and Comcast will only release Netflix on the X1 when the  viewer experience is great.   For Q3, we forecast US net adds of 0.3 million as un-grandfathering continues. We expect US  contribution margin to improve year over year in both Q3 and Q4 and we anticipate meeting our 40% US  contribution margin target by 2020, or even earlier.   International net additions in Q2 came to 1.5 million compared to our 2.0 million forecast.  Un-grandfathering occurred in Canada, UK/Ireland, Latin America, and the Nordics during Q2 where, like  the US, we saw a similar, earlier-than-expected impact on retention. In our newer markets, we continue  to learn and believe that growth will unfold over a multi-year period, similar to our experience in Latin  America.   International revenue rose 67% year over year. Excluding the impact of F/X (-$37 million impact on a y/y  basis), international ASP increased 8.7%. International contribution profit totaled -$69 million as content  spending was slightly lower than our forecast.  For Q3, we expect international net additions of 2.0m. Our approach in expanding our global footprint in  January was to launch a service targeting early adopters and then to listen, learn and iterate quickly.  Now that we are six months in, we will localize Netflix in Poland and Turkey with the addition of local  language in the user interface, subtitles and dubbing. Localization in other markets will take place over  time as economically prudent.   International contribution loss in Q3 is expected to be -$95 million as improving profitability in our  earlier foreign markets funds the investment in newer international territories. We remain confident in  these investments because of our success in all of the markets launched prior to 2014 which are  individually profitable on a contribution profit basis. These 2010-2013 launch markets are on track to  deliver ​aggregate contribution profit of around $500 million in 2016.  Prior to the global launch of our service in January, Netflix was available in 60 countries. In these earlier  expansion markets, our adoption rate in the first several months (as measured by penetration of  broadband households) has been highly varied and the initial uptake is not necessarily indicative of our  long-term penetration. We have already achieved success (contribution profits) in many types of  markets including those where English is not the main language (e.g. Chile); that have low pay TV  penetration (e.g. Australia); that have historically had high levels of piracy (e.g. Nordics); that have  payment or broadband infrastructure challenges (e.g. Mexico with payments and Canada with low data  caps); that have big competition (e.g. UK); that have low disposable income (e.g. Brazil); or that have  many of these factors (e.g. most of Latin America).         3  Unfortunately, this year the regulatory climate in China for our service has become more challenging.  Disney’s streaming service, launched in conjunction with Alibaba, was closed down, as was Apple’s  movie offering. We continue to explore options and, in the meantime, have plenty of work to do in our  newly opened markets.   Our global expansion is an exciting opportunity that will unfold over many years. Continued US growth  will be a part of it and there is no change to our view that in the US Netflix can reach 60-90 million  members. We continue to expect to run around break-even on a net income basis in 2016 and to  generate material profits in 2017 and beyond. We will drive operating profit growth in 2017 by reducing  our international losses and continuing to grow US profit.  Content  In Q2, we continued to expand the pace and breadth of original series, films and documentaries  released on Netflix, including the 4th season of ​Orange is the New Black​ and the second of our Adam  Sandler films, ​The Do Over​, ​which, at launch, was the number one most-watched film on Netflix in every  territory of the world and remains in the top 10 in many countries, including the US.  The substantial viewing of our growing ​slate of originals​ around the world is a testament to how well  high quality English-language TV travels. Local content constitutes a small minority of total viewing in  our international segment. We do not plan on trying to outcompete local TV networks in local content in  every nation of the world. Rather, we selectively complement our service with licensed and original local  content. We are developing non-English language original series and films in more than a dozen  countries including Brazil, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, South Korea, Argentina and  Spain when we find compelling, high quality projects with attractive economics and a potentially large  audience around the world. ​Narcos​, only partially in English, is an early success in this area.   We are also pleased with the critical acclaim received by our original programming. Last week, 17 of our  original series, documentaries, films and comedy specials received 54 Primetime Emmy nominations, up  from 34 last year. Netflix saw the largest increase in nominations among networks and has ​the third  most total nominations of any domestic network ​(behind only FX and HBO). Earlier, nine of our kids’  shows received 33 Daytime Emmy nominations, more than any other network. We have made good  progress since launching our first original series ​Lilyhammer​ in 2012.   While ramping up originals, we are also actively acquiring high quality, licensed content. We’ve  extended our licensing agreement with The CW Network, making Netflix the US SVOD home for prior  seasons of all scripted series broadcast on The CW beginning with the 2015-2016 TV season. Netflix  members will be able to stream full seasons of programs like ​Legends of Tomorrow​, ​Supergirl​, ​Arrow​ and  The Flash​, ​just eight days after each season finale.​ Next year, Netflix will also be the exclusive home of  the new ​Star Trek​ series from CBS outside the US and Canada, with new episodes arriving in 188  countries within 24 hours of their North American premiere.         4  Marketing  We primarily market our originals to drive member acquisition. Building off that, this past quarter we  began testing the availability of select episodes of a few of our original shows on linear television in  partnership with broadcasters. One week after its premiere on Netflix, the first two episodes of our first  French original series, ​Marseille​, aired on French broadcast network TF1. Season one episodes (but not  season two) of ​Narcos​ and ​Club de Cuervos​ will air on Univision and Unimas, respectively, in the US.  Through these tactics, we’re aiming to entice consumers to join Netflix to complete their binge. The  danger is diluting the perception that Netflix original content is only on Netflix, so we are testing  cautiously.   Product and Partnerships  As we have noted in the past, our global expansion in January means that we are now operating in some  markets where consumers access the Internet primarily through mobile devices. This has led us to invest  more in our mobile experience including sign up, authentication, user interface, payments and  streaming efficiency for cellular networks. In Q2, we began testing Google Play in-app payment on  Android devices, which we think will aid our ability to acquire new customers in many international  markets, as our iOS in-app payments have done.   To date, we have partnered with over 40 MVPDs across the world to make it easier for consumers to  enjoy and pay for Netflix, to grow awareness of our service in certain markets and to reach different  demographic segments. In the US, we are excited that Netflix will be available on the Comcast X1 set-top  box later this year.   Strong Net Neutrality  We continue to make progress with Open Connect, and the approval of the Charter/TWC merger with a  seven year condition of settlement-free interconnect is a helpful precedent. When ISPs around the  world agree to take our Open Connect servers in or near their networks for free, they see reductions in  their network costs, and as a result, the program has continued to grow in popularity.   Competition  Our goal remains to win as many “moments of truth” as we can. Given all the leisure activities  consumers can engage in - reading a book, playing videogames, watching a sports match, etc. - we  compete with a very broad set of alternatives. Our focus is to improve Netflix every day across multiple  dimensions including content, streaming quality, device footprint, payment options, and more. If we can  do that, we believe we have ample room to grow.  There are an increasing number of virtual MVPDs, like Sony Vue, DISH’s Sling TV, Amazon’s Streaming  Partners Program, and Hulu’s ​forthcoming service​, which offer a smaller bundle of TV channels at a  lower cost per month. To the degree these services provide an improved MVPD experience or spur  improvement amongst incumbent MVPDs to become more Internet-centric (on-demand, multi-screen,  personalized), they will become increased competition for entertainment time.   5  In the most recent Sandvine report, our share of North American Internet traffic was 35%. As we  referenced in our ​Q4 ’15 letter​ in January, our implementation of more efficient encoding would reduce  our results in the Sandvine report, which measures peak megabits, not peak viewing hours.     Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q2’16, free cash flow amounted to -$254 million, compared with -$261 million in Q1’16. We finished  the quarter with cash and equivalents of $1.8 billion, while gross debt was unchanged at $2.4 billion. We  still plan to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016/early 2017.   Our capital requirements continue to be driven by our investment in original content, particularly  programming that we produce, which requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content. Original  content provides Netflix with many benefits: new programming that debuts on Netflix, exclusivity,  greater creative and business control, global rights and brand halo. These merits outweigh the timing of  cash payments.   Our choice to fund these requirements through debt rather than equity is based on our desire to  optimize our capital structure to yield the lowest possible weighted average cost of capital. Given our  low debt to total capital ratio, the after tax cost of debt is currently more attractive than equity.     DVD  We finished Q2’16 with 4.5 million DVD members in the US, and contribution profit of $71 million.  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: ​April 2016​, ​January, 2016​, ​October 2015​,  July 2015​, ​April 2015​, ​January 2015​, ​October 2014​, ​July 2014​.       6  Summary  While we did not grow as fast as forecast in Q2, we are optimistic about the future owing to our singular  focus, global scale and the growth of Internet TV viewing. We are in the very early days of the shift from  linear television to on-demand viewing and there are nearly 1 billion pay TV subscribers worldwide who  will migrate to Internet TV over the coming decades.     On a personal note, this week we release season three of ​Bojack Horseman​ -- since you all follow the  media business, this is a series you may love as much as we do.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 809-5360      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures  This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the r​elease of tax reserves​, and to free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.  However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding impacts on subscriber growth and revenue arising from  un-grandfathering; marketing expense in support of originals and partnerships; growth of Internet TV;  7  impacts on our business from competition; US growth, contribution margin and long-term subscriber  numbers; international growth, net additions and contribution loss; localization efforts; profitability in  2017 and beyond; content strategy, including local content, original and licensed content investments;  future capital raises and timing of such raises; forecasts for domestic and international net, total and  paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic  (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net  income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject  to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer  usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,  competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and  events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.

      "Fellow shareholders    For Q2, revenue and operating income were right on forecast. Our streaming membership grew more  than expected, from 99m to 104m, due to our amazing content. We also crossed the symbolic  milestones of 100m members and more international than domestic members. It was a good quarter.             1    Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast  Our quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q2,  we underestimated the popularity of our strong slate of content which led to higher-than-expected  acquisition across all major territories. As a result, global net adds totaled a Q2-record 5.2 million (vs.  forecast of 3.2m) and increased 5% sequentially, bucking historical seasonal patterns. For the first six  months of 2017, net adds are up 21% year-on-year to 10.2m.  Our Q3 guidance assumes much of this momentum will continue but we are cognizant of the lessons of  prior quarters when we over-forecasted and there was lumpiness in net adds, likely due to demand  being pulled forward (into Q2 in this case).   Domestic net additions of 1.1m represented the highest level of Q2 net adds since the second quarter of  2011. For Q3’17, we project that we will add 0.75m US members, compared with 0.37m in Q3’16, which  was impacted by un-grandfathering.   Our international segment now accounts for 50.1% of our total membership base. International revenue  rose 57% year over year, excluding a -$23 million impact from foreign exchange, while international ASP  grew 10% year over year on a F/X neutral basis. International contribution profit of -$13 million vs. -$69  million was better than our -$28 million forecast due primarily to higher-than-forecasted paid members.   We’re forecasting Q3’17 international net adds of 3.65 million. We are making good progress with our  international expansion as improving profitability in our earlier international markets helps fund  significant investment in our newer territories. As a result, we expect​ positive international  contribution profit for the full year 2017​, at current F/X exchange rates. This would mark the first ever  annual contribution profit from our international segment.  For Q2, global streaming revenue was within 1% of our projection.  As expected, operating margin  dipped 516 basis points sequentially due to the timing of content releases, and came in at $128m on  forecast of $120m. Through the first half of 2017, our operating margin was 7.1%, putting us on track for  our full year target of 7%, which we plan on growing in 2018 and beyond. Q2 EPS was on target at $0.15,  as a greater than expected tax benefit offset a -$64 million non-cash unrealized loss from our euro bond  (which was recognized in our P&L in interest and other income/expense).  Content  Last week, the Television Academy nominated 27 Netflix original programs with 91 Emmy nominations,  nearly double last year’s tally. With five of the 14 total nominated best series contenders (​Stranger  Things, The Crown, House of Cards, Master of None ​and​ Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt​), Netflix had the  most nominated series of any network. We are proud that even as we have increased our volume of  originals across several genres, we continue to grow the recognition for the quality of those shows,  including brand new series like ​Stranger Things​ and​ The Crown​, which will have second season  premieres in 2017.   The volume and breadth of our releases in Q2 exemplify our commitment to serve the desires of our  diverse and growing audience. We premiered 14 new seasons of global Netflix original series, 13 original  2    comedy specials, 6 original documentaries, 2 original documentary series, 9 original feature films and 7  seasons of original series for kids.  You can track the dates of all of our upcoming launches ​here​.  We strive to be bold in our programming choices ​and​ financially disciplined, so we can keep being bold.  Every show has passionate fans and committed talent striving for excellence. Sometimes those shows  don’t attract as many viewers as we had hoped, compared to our other content.  As much as we dislike  ending a series early, it consoles us that it frees up investment for another new show, or two.  We are  programming to please our members and we keep that as our guiding light. We love it when we support  a new series that has big impact like ​Stranger Things, Cable Girls,​ and ​13 Reasons Why​.   As a global TV network, we also showcase local productions to a worldwide audience through our  investments in non-English language originals. Our Spanish language original ​Ingobernable​, starring Kate  del Castillo, has been viewed by millions of members outside of Mexico. Similarly, in Q2, our first original  from Spain, ​Las Chicas del Cable​ (​Cable Girls​), attracted significant viewership in the US and throughout  the entire Spanish-speaking world.  We understand that our approach to films - debuting movies on Netflix first - is counter to Hollywood’s  century-old windowing ​tradition​. But just as we changed and reinvented the TV business by putting  consumers first and making access to content more convenient, we believe internet TV can similarly  reinvigorate the film business (as distinct from the theatrical business). This year we will release 40  features that range from big budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema.  We are proud to  produce films like ​Okja​, ​War Machine​ and ​Bright,​ with big stars, distinctive directors and compelling  stories, as well as to introduce new voices like Macon Blair, whose directorial debut ​I Don’t Feel at Home  in This World Anymore​, produced by Netflix, won the Dramatic Jury competition at the Sundance Film  Festival this year. Within a few weeks of the win, it premiered on Netflix everywhere, so that it could be  enjoyed by fans, exactly when the world was talking about it.  Product and Partnerships  Since the early days of our streaming service, we have partnered with a wide variety of companies to  make it easier for consumers to enjoy Netflix. Our partnerships began with consumer electronic  companies and video game consoles and evolved to include smartphone makers, mobile operators and  MVPDs and ISPs. In Q2, we announced a partnership with Altice/SFR France, whereby Netflix will be sold  in a package with high speed Internet and TV services. These arrangements are mutually beneficial - our  partners gain more customers and can upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while Netflix  gains more reach and awareness with consumers across a market. We are likely to expand this approach  as a complement to our direct-to-consumer primary approach.   Competition  The competition for entertainment time is always intense, but the silver lining is that the market is vast  and diverse. YouTube is earning over a billion hours a day of consumers’ time with one type of  entertainment, while we are earning over a billion hours a week with our type of entertainment. Linear  TV is still huge, piracy still substantial, and there are thousands of firms and approaches around the  world earning some fraction of consumers’ entertainment time. The entertainment market is so broad  3    that we’ve grown from zero to over 50m streaming households in the US over the last 10 years, and yet  HBO continues to increase its US subscriptions. It seems our growth just expands the market. The largely  exclusive nature of each service’s content means that we are not direct substitutes for each other, but  rather complements.   In addition to the many SVOD players around the world (Blim, Globoplay, FilmStruck, Hooq, iflix, Stan,  etc.) the large-cap tech companies, especially Amazon, are investing heavily in original and licensed  content around the world. They join all the existing TV networks (BBC, AMC, NHK, etc.) of the world, and  us, in bidding for great content. Creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment  is pouring into content production around the world.   We are all co-pioneers of internet TV and, together, we are replacing linear TV. The shift from linear TV  to on-demand viewing is so big and there is so much leisure time, many internet TV services will be  successful. The internet may not have been great for the music business due to piracy, but, wow, it is  incredible for growing the video entertainment business around the world.   Culture  We recently crafted a major update on our ​culture description​, to reflect our thinking as we have  become more global. Our culture plays a major role in our continued evolution and success.     Free Cashflow and Capital Structure  Q2’17 free cash amounted to -$608 million vs. -$254 million in the year ago quarter and -$423 million in  Q1’17. We anticipate free cash flow of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. With our content  strategy paying off in strong member, revenue and profit growth, we think it’s wise to continue to  invest. In continued success, we will deploy increased capital in content, particularly in owned originals,  and, as we have said before, we expect to be FCF negative for many years. Since our FCF is driven by our  content investment, particularly in self-produced originals, we wanted to provide some additional  context on our content accounting at our ​investor relations​ website.   We continue to debt finance our capital needs as we believe this reduces our weighted average cost of  capital, resulting in a more efficient capital structure. In May, we completed a 1.3 billion euro bond  offering. In addition to a small natural hedge to our growing European revenues, we are pleased to have  broadened our access to capital markets beyond the US high yield market. Our euro bond may add some  volatility to our net income as each quarter we remeasure the liability on our balance sheet based on  the quarter end euro-to-dollar exchange rate. As a reminder, quarter-to-quarter remeasurement  changes in this liability are reflected as a non-cash unrealized gain (loss) below operating income in  “interest and other income/expense” in our P&L (-$64 million impact on net income in Q2’17).   Summary  It’s been twenty years since Netflix was founded and we still thrive on connecting people with great  stories. Someday, we hope to entertain everyone.    4    For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: ​April 2017​, ​January 2017​, ​October 2016​,  July 2016​, ​April 2016​, ​January, 2016​, ​October 2015​, ​July 2015​.

      "We are very pleased to have over 40 million members, up from less than 30 million just one year ago. The Netflix original series Orange is the New Black is a critical and popular success, and our earlier series House of Cards is the first Internet TV series to win a Primetime Emmy Award. We launched our 41st country and the Dutch seem to like Netflix. Our summary results and Q4 guidance midpoints are below: (in millions except per share data) Q3 '12 Q4 '12 Q1 '13 Q2 '13 Q3 '13 Q4 '13 Guidance Midpoint Domestic: Net Additions 1.16 2.05 2.03 0.63 1.29 2.01 Total Members 25.10 27.15 29.17 29.81 31.09 33.10 Paid Members 23.80 25.47 27.91 28.62 29.93 31.45 Revenue $ 556 $ 589 $ 639 $ 671 $ 701 $ 736 Contribution Profit $ 96 $ 113 $ 131 $ 151 $ 166 $ 171 Contribution Margin 17.2% 19.2% 20.6% 22.5% 23.7% 23.2% International: Net Additions 0.69 1.81 1.02 0.61 1.44 1.31 Total Members 4.31 6.12 7.14 7.75 9.19 10.50 Paid Members 3.69 4.89 6.33 7.01 8.08 9.40 Revenue $ 78 $ 101 $ 142 $ 166 $ 183 $ 217 Contribution Profit (Loss) $ (92) $ (105) $ (77) $ (66) $ (74) $ (65) Contribution Margin -118.8% -103.2% -54.2% -39.7% -40.6% -30.0% Total (including DVD): Revenue $ 905 $ 945 $ 1,024 $ 1,069 $ 1,106 Operating Income $ 16 $ 20 $ 32 $ 57 $ 57 Net Income $ 8 $ 8 $ 3 $ 29 $ 32 $ 37 EPS $ 0.13 $ 0.13 $ 0.05 $ 0.49 $ 0.52 $ 0.60 Free Cash Flow $ (20) $ (51) $ (42) $ 13 $ 7 Shares (FD) 58.7 59.1 60.1 60.6 61.0 1Domestic Domestic net additions of 1.3 million were 11% higher than prior year Q3 due to the growing strength of our content offering, aided by the great press coverage and social buzz generated by Orange is the New Black and our Emmy nominations, and the softer comp in Q3 2012 from the impact of the summer Olympics. We expect Q4 net additions to be approximately equal to Q4 of the prior year and to expand our contribution margin about 400 basis points year over year to about 23%, assuming the midpoint of our guidance. This means that sequentially our target contribution margin is slightly down Q3 to Q4. As a reminder, we shifted our contribution margin target a few months ago from “100 basis points of quarterly sequential improvement” to “400 basis points Q over prior year Q” so we are right on target with our articulated margin growth strategy. Our $7.99 price is working very well for us for both membership growth and contribution margin growth. While our original series get most of the headlines, a bigger percentage of overall Netflix viewing is generated by our exclusive complete season-after series. During the quarter, we launched new seasons of The New Girl, The Walking Dead, Scandal, Breaking Bad, Revolution and Pretty Little Liars. We also announced that Netflix will be the exclusive home to high quality first-run Pay1 films from The Weinstein Company beginning in 2016. Our kids offering was strengthened during the quarter by adding top rated and award winning Scholastic TV shows, Goosebumps and The Magic School Bus. We also announced an expanded list of PBS shows including Super Why!, Wild Kratts, Caillou and Arthur, as well as all seasons of the critically-acclaimed mystery The Bletchley Circle. International International net additions were way up from the prior year at 1.4 million new members, driven by our expansion to the Nordics and the Netherlands since last Q3, as well as growth in our existing markets from our steadily improving service, content and marketing. In addition, there was a surge in low quality free trials in September in Latin America that temporarily boosted the total member number. The paid net adds remain a reliable indicator of progress. Our Q3 international contribution loss was $74 million, as we saw flat to slight sequential improvements in contribution profits in all international markets during the quarter, offset by the Netherlands launch expense. In Q4, assuming the midpoint of our guidance, we expect continued momentum to result in about 1.3 million net additions, to end 2013 with 10.5 million international members. This compares to 1.8 million net additions in Q4 a year ago, which was our Nordics launch quarter. In all our other markets (Canada, Latin America, UK/IE, Netherlands), we expect net additions to be steady or up on a Q4 over Q4 basis. Sequentially, we expect international total member net adds in Q4 to be flat to down (1.4 million in Q3 to 1.3 million) as we work through the low-quality Latin America free trials from Q3, but paid net adds in Q4 are forecasted to rise (1.1 million in Q3 to 1.3 million). 2For Q4, we expect our contribution losses to improve to $65 million, assuming the midpoint of our guidance. We plan to launch in new markets next year, executing on the strategy outlined in our long term view letter. Our success this year in increasing international net additions to nearly the level of our domestic net additions shows substantial momentum and confirms our belief there is a big international opportunity for Netflix. Original Content An excellent summary of our early progress in original content is this two-minute video. Over the next few years we aspire to support creation of some of the most compelling and remarkable content ever produced. Coupled with the flexibility of our Internet viewing and power of our personal recommendations we will keep changing television for the better. Orange is the New Black has been a tremendous success for us. It will end the year as our most watched original series ever and, as with each of our other previously launched originals, enjoys an audience comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV. We have seen sustained social media buzz in the months after its debut and it is also one of the most critically well received TV shows of 2013. Orange is the New Black was not eligible for the Emmys in 2013, but Season 1 will be eligible next year and we believe the audience for Season 2 will grow substantially. Speaking of Emmys, we were thrilled to be a part of TV history in the quarter by winning 3 Emmy awards (3 of our original series received 14 total nominations). David Fincher’s win for Outstanding Director in a Drama Series made House of Cards the first TV series to win a major primetime Emmy without ever airing on a broadcast network or cable channel. We were delighted for David as well as Laray Mayfield and Julie Schubert who won for Outstanding Casting in a Drama Series and Eigil Bryld who picked up an Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single Camera Series. In addition to Orange is the New Black, during Q3, we launched the new Ricky Gervais series Derek and broadened our original content offering with the acquisition of high profile stand up comedy specials from Russell Peters and Aziz Ansari, premiering exclusively on Netflix in October and November, respectively. We also rolled out a second set of episodes of Mako Mermaids, our original series directed at the teen audience, and will soon expand into original documentaries, a category that does well on the Netflix service. This quarter we will premiere our inaugural second season of a Netflix original series with the return of Lilyhammer starring Steven Van Zandt. We will also be launching our first animated original series with Dreamworks Animation, Turbo F.A.S.T. 34  In 2014, we expect to double our investment in original content (though still representing less than 10%  of our overall global content expense).  Coming to Netflix next year will be second seasons of House of  Cards, Orange is the New Black, Derek and Hemlock Grove as well as the just announced project from  Todd and Glenn Kessler and Daniel Zelman, the Emmy and Golden Globe nominated creators of  Damages.  We’ll also roll out a number of new animated series from DreamWorks Animation.  Expect  more news on additional new original projects in the months to come.   When we started with original content we didn’t have specific data about viewing patterns over time for  content that premieres on Netflix.  We decided to use straight line amortization based on our  experience with TV series from other networks.  Now we have more specific viewing data for original  content which shows more viewing in the early months of a show’s debut, so we are accelerating the  amortization of such content commensurately.  We’ll continue to monitor the viewing patterns and  adjust the amortization schedule as appropriate.   Marketing  Our global marketing campaigns promote compelling content, unique product features and the joy of  the Netflix experience.  These messages are adapted market by market to form deeper brand  connections with our customers wherever they live.    Q3 saw the launch of our Netherlands ‘All You Can Watch’ campaign and new advertising in the Nordic  countries and Brazil, all of which communicate our brand proposition nuanced for local tastes.    We continue to feature our content in advertising.  Our goal is to shape customer perceptions of our  catalog through an always-on layer of content marketing targeted at specific demographic groups. Last  month we launched “TV Too” in which we are promoting the wealth of TV series on Netflix, taking  advantage of the tremendous influx of new seasons coming into the service with the message ‘Discover,  Relive, Start from the Beginning’.    With regard to online advertising, we continue to improve our global efficiency and targeting with  investments in programmatic and online video advertising.  Our aim is to target consumers with the  right message at the right stage of their consumer journey in both direct response and brand messages.    Product  During Q3, we launched profiles, offering individual personalization for each member of a household  and “My List” to help all members save titles to watch later in a more organized and adaptive manner  than our prior Instant Queue, which was available only to U.S. members.  Both of these features help  members find and engage with films and TV series matched to their individual tastes.    5  The growth of smart TVs and Internet TV devices, such as AppleTV, Roku, and Chromecast, are  increasing the availability of TV streaming platforms.  Tablets and phones also are rapidly growing as  Netflix viewing platforms.      We launched with Virgin Media, the UK’s leading cable company, a world first:  Netflix on a major cable  set-top box.  It is rolling out over this quarter to Virgin Media’s subscribers.  The integration of search  and suggestions between broadband and cable is great for customers, and we want this superior  experience to help Virgin Media gain market share in the UK.      Cable operators like Virgin Media believe that by enabling their subscribers to do more with their cable  set-top and remote, they can increase satisfaction, relative to their subscribers using a separate Internet  set-top box or smart TV to enjoy Netflix.  We are open to more of these integrations with cable set-tops  around the world, but given the fragmented technology footprints, we think it will be many years before  cable set-top boxes match Internet set-top boxes for Netflix streaming volume.  As a general rule, we’re  happy to support devices from other video providers as long as we get application placement  commensurate with our popularity.      DVD  The huge selection we offer on DVD, including all the HBO and other Pay TV series, continues to be a  source of satisfaction for 7.15 million domestic households, and we generated $107 million of  contribution profit, as expected.  With the USPS rate announcement in September, we anticipate a  postal rate increase in January of 3 cents each way or $3-4 million per quarter of additional expense in  2014.    Profitability  We were pleased with our global profitability for Q3.  We delivered on our targets despite the faster  amortization of original content, which pulled forward into Q3 about $27 million in expense from future  quarters, due to more members and revenue than expected and by adjusting spending in Q3 on other  items.  The effect of the faster amortization of original content is small enough that we are not changing  our domestic contribution margin targets (400 basis points Q over prior year Q) or our global  profitability targets (stay profitable despite international investments).            6  Stock Volatility  In calendar year 2003 we were the highest performing stock on Nasdaq.  We had solid results  compounded by momentum-investor-fueled euphoria.  Some of the euphoria today feels like 2003.      Despite the huge swings in our stock price since our 2002 IPO ($8 to $3 to $39 to $8 to $300 to $55 to  $330), we’ve continued to grow our membership every year fairly steadily.  We do our best to ignore the  volatility in our stock.  The progress we’ve made over the last 10 years is stunning.  We want to make  the next 10 years even more remarkable.    Business Outlook  We have also updated our long term view letter.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating  income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial  measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP  measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding meeting domestic contribution margin targets;  international contribution losses; expansion into new geographic markets and the impact of  international expansion; investments in content, particularly original content, including second seasons  of original content and new categories of original content; business outlook for our DVD segment,  including contribution profit and the impact of a USPS rate increase; the rate and impact of integration  on cable set-top boxes; member growth domestically and internationally, including total and paid;  revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international  operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2013.  The forward- looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain  existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms  for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our  website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service;  competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013.  We undertake no obligation to update  forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                           9 Netflix, Inc.

Domestic streaming revenue of $877 million, in-line with forecast, grew 25% y/y and faster than membership due to the expansion of ASP from the price changes implemented in Q2. We added two million members internationally, to end the quarter with 15.84 million members, with lower net adds than our forecast, but higher than prior year. International revenue of $346 million, in- line with forecast, grew 89% y/y, and faster than membership, again due to the expansion of our ASP. As a reminder, we provide you our internal forecast for the current quarter. For the prior three quarters, we under-forecasted membership growth. This quarter we over-forecasted membership growth. We’ll continue to give you our internal forecast for the current quarter, and it will be high some of the time and low other times. Separate from forecast variability, year on year net additions in the US were down (1.3 million in Q3 2013 to 1 million in Q3 2014). As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago. Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth, other things being equal, and this is manifested more clearly in higher adoption markets such as the US. In hindsight, we believe that late Q2 and early Q3 the impact of higher prices appeared to be offset for about two months by the large positive reception to Season Two of Orange is the New Black. We remain happy with the price changes and growth in revenue and will continue to improve our service, with better content, better streaming and better choosing. The effect of slightly higher prices is factored into our Q4 forecast. Since our per-member viewing and retention in the US are as strong as ever, we don’t think increased competition from piracy, TV Everywhere, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Hulu, etc, is a major factor. There is no change to our view on the long term attractiveness and US market size of Internet television, and no change to our view of the ultimate size of our US membership. We are forecasting Q4 US contribution margin to increase almost 500 basis points on a y/y basis, but to decrease slightly sequentially, as it did last year from Q3 to Q4, due to significant sequential increases in content and marketing expense. In September, we had a very successful launch in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, adding about 66 million1 broadband households to our addressable market. In recent days, our app has gone live on set-top boxes from SFR in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany, and 1 SNL Kagan 2we expect deployments this quarter from Orange and Bouygues in France, and Belgacom in Belgium. We’ve had more success, more quickly, with MVPD set-top boxes in these new markets than anywhere else in the world. As expected, we have a full quarter of new market expenses weighing on our international contribution margins in Q4, increasing contribution loss from Q3 to Q4. Our international markets launched prior to this year (Canada 4 years ago through Netherlands 1 year ago) are now collectively profitable on a contribution basis and will continue to help us fund new markets. Moreover, contribution margin from our first expansion market, Canada, now approximates the US. Starting in January, we have to pay higher VAT in most of Europe due to changes in European law (country of origin to country of destination). We will absorb these increases rather than pass them on to our members. This absorption will be reflected in slightly lower international contribution margin/profit starting in Q1 than we would otherwise have. Given how well our international expansion has performed, we intend substantial further expansion in 2015, consistent with our stated strategy. US contribution margin increases beyond 30% Our US contribution margin grew about 500 bps to 28.6% for Q3. After achieving 30% contribution margin, likely in Q1 or Q2 of next year, we will seek to grow margins an average of 200 basis points per year for the following years. Ideally, we will achieve 40% contribution margin five years after achieving 30%. This increase in our domestic contribution margin gives us room to increase content spending as we grow, as well as substantial domestic profitability. Content In Q3, we launched several new original series, documentaries and comedy specials, while ensuring future access to one of the most successful and globally appealing series of the North American fall TV season, Gotham. In our second year of qualification as a programmer, Netflix took home seven Emmy awards. Original Series BoJack Horseman marked our expansion into the popular adult animated comedy genre. In the past, we’ve licensed back seasons of already successful series like Archer, Futurama, and Bob’s Burgers. BoJack Horseman, starring Will Arnett, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris, drew more viewers in its first few weeks than any of these established network shows over a comparable period on Netflix, confirming for us the value of expanding into original series. TV Guide wrote that BoJack Horseman was the “funniest show of the fall” and we are now in production on season two for 2015. In Q3, we also launched a second season of Hemlock Grove and an original 4th and final season of The Killing. Both shows have been well received globally. We are now in pre-production of the final season 3of Hemlock Grove. We also premiered two acclaimed British series in North America, Happy Valley (in US and Canada) and Peaky Blinders (US only). We are looking forward to the December 12 release of our next major original series Marco Polo, an epic, cinematic tale of power, adventure and betrayal. We are currently in production on nine Netflix original series around the world and during the quarter announced a new comedy series, Love, from Judd Apatow, premiering in 2016. Original Documentary, Kids and Comedy Beyond scripted series, we launched three original documentaries in the quarter, Battered Bastards of Baseball, Mission Blue and Print the Legend. These documentaries have grown in audience reach and have positioned Netflix as a significant player in a category that attracts some of the most loyal and intense viewers. Finishing off the year, we will release E-Team, a powerful journalistic film from Oscar winning director Ross Kauffman and Katy Chevigny, and Virunga, a riveting film about the tensions over one of Africa’s best known national parks and the home of the mountain gorillas. Netflix continues to be a key destination for kids and families. We now offer members 75 kids series that are each delighting more than 2 million viewers on Netflix. More than a dozen of these series, many of them exclusive to Netflix, reach over 5 million viewers. During the quarter, we announced a partnership with Saban Brands to reboot the popular Popples animated series, with Rainbow Studios to extend their Winx Club stories and with storied producer Avi Arad and 41 Entertainment to produce a CGI film and series with a new take on the origin story of King Kong. In Q4, we will launch on Netflix the premiere episodes of two original series from DreamWorks Animation, the return of the beloved kids franchise Veggie Tales and All Hail King Julien, based on the popular character from Madagascar. Last week, Chelsea Handler’s Uganda Be Kidding Me Live arrived globally on Netflix to strong viewing and rave reviews. Next year, Chelsea will create four comedy documentaries for Netflix with her new take on the traditional talk show to follow in 2016. In Q3, Jim Jeffries brought his latest stand-up show to Netflix members, while this quarter, our members will enjoy new material from Chelsea Peretti (Brooklyn Nine Nine) , Bill Burr, Wyatt Cenac (The Daily Show) and the legendary Bill Cosby. Original Films On August 28, 2015, we will release our first Netflix original film, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend. A big budget continuation of the beloved 2000 Oscar-nominated film, it will debut simultaneously on select global IMAX screens and in Ultra HD 4k on Netflix, offering consumers the option to see this beautiful action film how and when they want. Separately, we announced plans to release only on Netflix four new Adam Sandler feature comedies, beginning in early 2016. Sandler is a true global movie star, grossing over $3 billion over the last twenty years, and generating huge viewing across all Netflix territories. We are investing in original films because doing so can be favorable economically compared to current Pay TV deals and is consistent with the desires of the global on- 45    demand generation to enjoy new movies without having to wait for months after they debut in US  theaters.  Multi-territory Television Licensing  In Q3, we secured second window rights from Warner Bros. Television for the Fox series Gotham in all  current and planned Netflix territories.  This historic deal will deliver the series to Netflix members soon  after the broadcast completion of each season and ensures that Netflix will be the only subscription  video service in these territories to offer the Batman origin series, commercial free and on demand in  full season presentations.   In our just launched territories in Europe, Netflix debuted as original series the Emmy-winning Fargo  from MGM Television as well as From Dusk Till Dawn from El Rey and Penny Dreadful from CBS  Television.  These deals ensure our international members access to hit US television series without  having to wait the months or years imposed by traditional TV models and should help to reduce piracy in  those markets.   Product  Improved Laptop Streaming  We are midway through switching to native HTML5 streaming for our laptop players, eliminating  downloads (of Silverlight) and improving the consumer proposition with a smoother playback  experience and longer battery life.  This has been a successful four-year effort to get strong DRM  integrated into the major browsers.      Set-top Boxes  Using the same techniques we developed to get on hundreds of different Blu-ray players and Smart TVs,  we are now able to support a wide variety of MVPD set-top devices with an outstanding and updatable  application.  The Virgin/TiVo architecture was our first, which is a fairly modern system.    We have since  expanded to less high-end systems.       Personal recommendations  We have continued to improve our various recommendations systems, which match users to content  based upon their preferences.  We have rolled out a new visual search feature on the website and  mobile platforms; it includes suggested viewing possibilities for searches that come up empty.        6    Strong Net Neutrality  We continue to focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, to prevent large ISPs from  holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance in order to extract payments from us, other  Internet content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent.   We’ve increased awareness of this issue globally.  Our efforts have helped generate a record breaking  number of comments to the FCC in favor of net neutrality, while in Europe policymakers are beginning  to focus on this issue.  We will continue to advocate for the US government to block the merger of Comcast/TWC or, at the  very least, prevent a combined entity from charging for interconnection.    HBO  Starting back in 2011 we started saying that HBO would be our primary long-term competitor,  particularly for content. The competition will drive us both to be better.  It was inevitable and sensible  that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application.  Many people will subscribe to  both Netflix and HBO since we have different shows, so we think it is likely we both prosper as  consumers move to Internet TV.      DVD  Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight about 6 million members, adding $89 million in  contribution profit in Q3 and we anticipate close to the same in Q4.    Operating Income  Operating income nearly doubled y/y to $110 million despite our investment in international expansion.   To support this expansion, we’ve invested in personnel growth in our corporate G&A functions which is  the primary driver of both the y/y and sequential increase in G&A.  Also contributing to the sequential  increase was an increase in legal fees and one-time costs related to the launch of our new markets.            7  Free Cash Flow & Content Obligations Historically, FCF tracked close to net income.  As we’ve written previously, our increased use of cash for  content, especially originals, will cause FCF to be materially less than net income, at least for the years  ahead while we are increasing our investment in this area.  In addition, in quarters like Q3 with big  international territory launches, we have only a partial quarter of international content P&L expense but  a full quarter of cash payments.  We finished the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash.    Our total streaming content obligations increased to $8.9 billion in the quarter from $7.7 billion at the  end of Q2, which includes $3.6 billion on the balance sheet.  The increase was driven by the multi-year  commitments associated with our latest market launches in Europe and the continued expansion of our  original programming, including our first original movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend.

Summary The overwhelming consumer benefits of Internet television, in terms of convenience, control, selection,  and price, continue to expand our opportunity.   8    Sincerely,                                                                                           Reed Hastings, CEO      David Wells, CFO                                                                                                                         October 15, 2014 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview today at 3 p.m.  Pacific Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance; content  offerings; device and platform integration; forecast variability; member growth domestically and  internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin  for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating  income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including,  without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to  compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations  in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service  Providers; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.  The Company provides internal forecast  numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers  based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                 10 Netflix, Inc.

      "Fellow shareholders,    We are growing nicely across the world and are on track to exceed $11 billion in revenue in 2017.  Internet entertainment is delighting consumers, and we are staying at the forefront of this  once-in-a-generation opportunity.         1  Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Global streaming revenue in Q3 rose 33% year over year, driven by a 24% increase in average paid  memberships and 7% growth in ASP. Operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $209 million  with our Q3 global operating margin of 7.0% putting us right on track to achieve our full year target of  7%. EPS of $0.29 included a pre-tax $51 million non-cash loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro  bond (or $39 million after tax based on a 24% tax rate). Higher than expected excess tax benefit from  stock based compensation benefited our tax rate by $5 million vs. our forecast. As a reminder, the  quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.   We added a Q3-record 5.3 million memberships globally (up 49% year-over-year) as we continued to  benefit from strong appetite for our original series and films, as well as the adoption of internet  entertainment across the world. Relative to our guidance of 4.4 million net adds, we under-forecasted  both US and international acquisition. Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29% versus last year.   Domestic contribution margin in Q3 of 35.8% vs. 36.4% last year was below our forecast of 37.1% due  primarily to the earlier-than-anticipated close of certain content deals. The foreign currency impact in  the quarter was +$13 million and  Q3 international revenue grew 54% year over year, excluding  currency. F/X-neutral ASP increased 7.4% year over year. International contribution profit margin of  4.7% exceeded our 2.3% guidance, also due to the timing of content deals.   For Q4, we forecast global net adds of 6.30m (1.25m in the US and 5.05m internationally) vs. 7.05m in  the year ago quarter (which was our all-time high for quarterly net adds). We recently announced price  adjustments in many markets to our HD and 4K video plans while keeping our SD plan mostly unchanged  (still $7.99 in the US, for instance). Existing members will be notified and their prices will be adjusted on  a rolling basis over the next few months. Increased revenue over time will help us grow our content  offering and continue our global operating margin growth.   We’ve been focused on growing global operating margin as our primary profitability metric since hitting  our 2020 US contribution margin goal of 40% this past Q1. This allows us to avoid near term  optimization for specific domestic or international contribution margin targets which could impede our  long term growth. For instance, we anticipate our Q4’17 US contribution margin will be 34.4% (a decline  both year-on-year and sequentially) as we boost our marketing investment against a growing content  slate. We spend disproportionately in the US to generate media and influencer awareness for our  programming which we believe, in turn, is an effective way to facilitate word of mouth globally. In our  international segment, we are on track to generate positive contribution profit for the full year. As we  move into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing  operating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the  rest of the world.         2  Content  Five years ago, we embarked on our original programming strategy and we’re very pleased with our  progress in transforming Netflix from a service with not just second run content but also must-see new  releases, like ​Stranger Things​, ​Orange is the New Black​, ​House of Cards, Fuller House, Making a  Murderer, Narcos, The Crown​ and ​13 Reasons Why​, among many others.   This quarter, we launched several new series such as the gritty drama ​Ozark​ and comedy ​Friends from  College​ by Nick Stoller as well as ​Marvel’s The Defenders ​and returning seasons of fan favorites like  Narcos ​and ​Fuller House​. We’re also making good strides on original films (as measured by member  viewing relative to our investment) with the debut of ​Death Note​ (based on the popular Japanese IP),  Naked​ (a romantic comedy featuring Marlon Wayans) and ​To the Bone​ (an intense drama starring Lily  Collins).   Investors often ask us about continued access to content from diversified media companies.  While we  have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term  trends are clear. Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around  Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes. Our  investment in Netflix originals is over a quarter of our total P&L content budget in 2017 and will  continue to grow.  With $17 billion in content commitments over the next several years and a growing  library of owned content ($2.5 billion net book value at the end of the quarter), we remain quite  comfortable with our ability to please our members around the world. We’ll spend $7-8 billion on  content (on a P&L basis) in 2018.   Just as we moved from second-run content to licensed originals and then to Netflix-produced originals,  we are progressing even further up the value chain to work directly with talented content creators. In  August, we announced an overall deal with ​Shonda Rhimes​, the creator of global smash hits like ​Grey’s  Anatomy​, ​How to Get Away with Murder​, ​Scandal​, and others. We also acquired ​Millarworld​, our one  M&A transaction in our 20 year history, the home of legendary comic book writer Mark Millar. Our goal  is to work with the best creators in the world and own the underlying intellectual property so that we  can continue to deliver amazing content to our members across the globe.   In working with the best talent, we strive hard for awards recognition. At this year’s Primetime Emmys,  we scored 20 wins out of 92 nominations, second only to HBO, spread across eight different titles.   Competition  Since 2013, we’ve taken the ​Long Term View​ that we’re in the early stages of the worldwide,  multi-decade transition from linear TV to internet entertainment. Recently, it’s been unfolding right  before our eyes: ​Disney​ announced plans to launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and its other  brands, cable network owners are licensing their channels to virtual MVPDs like Hulu, YouTube, Sling TV,  and DirecTV Now, CBS’ All Access is expanding ​internationally​, Apple is reportedly planning on spending  $1 billion on original content and Amazon is streaming NFL games while its Prime Video service has gone  global. Facebook launched its ​Watch tab​ for original videos.   3  At the same time, linear TV networks like ​MTV​, ​A&E​ and ​WGN​ are cutting down on scripted series. Last  year, the number of original scripted series on linear TV (across broadcast, premium and basic cable)  began to decrease as online services ramped up activity.  It’s an exciting period and both media and technology companies see the same big opportunity as we  do. We have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible to please our  members by earning their viewing time and to stay ahead of the competition in the decades to come.   Product and Partnerships  Ironically, as linear networks move outside of the traditional bundle and into direct-to-consumer  applications, we are working more closely than ever with MVPDs/ISPs and other distributors. Building on  our Q2 partnership with SFR/Altice in France, where Netflix is sold in a package with high speed Internet  and TV services, and an earlier, comparable partnership with Proximus of Belgium, this past quarter we  announced the bundling of Netflix into ​T-Mobile’s ONE family plan​. Our partners are enthusiastic about  the response to these bundles as the excitement around our big content enhances their offerings.   Our goal with all of our partnerships is to make it easy for members to sign up, pay and enjoy Netflix. We  are pleased with the early results and we will continue pursuing these bundling opportunities as a  complement to our core direct-to-consumer approach.   Free Cashflow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$465 million vs. -$506 million last year and -$608 million in Q2’17. There is  no change to our expectation for FCF of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017.  Negative FCF,  despite growing operating income, is due to growth of our content spend, original content in particular,  where we pay for the titles before consumers enjoy the content, and the asset is amortized by  estimated viewing over time. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market as our  after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity.   Summary   This quarter, among other new offerings, we are releasing the second Netflix original series from David  Fincher (​Mindhunter), ​new seasons of our globally acclaimed franchises ​Stranger Things ​and ​The Crown,  our first Italian and German original shows (​Suburra​ and​ Dark)​ and our most ambitious film yet, ​Bright​,  starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding growing revenues and our position within internet  entertainment; price changes, increasing revenues, content spend and growing margin; marketing  spend; investment in Asia and Rest of World markets; our original programming strategy; access to  content, competition, and partnerships, including bundles; free cash flow and financing; domestic and  international net, total and paid members; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin  for both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin;  net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms and partnerships for streaming our service;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  5  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company  provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from  these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K.

      "We ended 2013 with over 44 million members. We had higher domestic net additions than in 2012, growing international success, and an impressive first slate of original series. We expect to end Q1 with 48 million members. Our summary results, and forecast for Q1, are below.

The healthy y/y growth in net additions was likely fueled by our service improvements, marketing effectiveness, and sales of Internet connected devices. We expect this momentum to continue in Q1 with net additions of 2.25 million to exceed the prior year by about 11%. Running equal to, or slightly above, prior year net additions is a great outcome because it implies that at 33 million domestic members we’re still in the middle section of the S curve of consumer adoption, with years of member growth ahead of us. Our US contribution margin during the quarter increased 420 basis points y/y to 23.4%, as we continued to grow membership and revenue faster than content expense. Over the past 8 quarters since we first broke out the streaming segment, our contribution margin has expanded significantly from the 12.2% posted in Q4’11. Our strong results indicate that a 30% quarterly contribution margin may start being achievable in 2015. At 30%, we’d re-evaluate the right margin growth target, given conditions at that time. To the extent our contribution margin climbs above 30%, it will get harder to keep it growing at 400 basis points per year. Last April we introduced a 4-concurrent stream $11.99 option to begin our evaluation of plan tiering. Since late last year, we have also been testing 1-stream and 3-stream variants, as well as SD/HD variations, at various price points. Eventually, we hope to be able to offer new members a selection of three simple options to fit everyone’s taste. If we do make pricing changes for new members, existing members would get generous grandfathering of their existing plans and prices, so there would be no material near-term revenue increase from moving to this potential broader set of options. We are in no rush to implement such new member plans and are still researching the best way to proceed. As a reminder, Q2 net additions will typically be less than the prior year, even in a year where total net additions are up, due to increased seasonality that comes with a bigger member base. (See the very end of our Q1 2012 earnings letter for an explanation.) In addition, in Q2 2013 we launched Arrested Development, which had a strong established brand and passionate fan base, generating a small boost in membership, making Q2 2014 a tougher than normal comp period. Our domestic growth is very strong, much of which should be attributed to the tailwind of Internet video growth in general. Hulu had 3 CEOs in 2013, and yet grew paid subscribers an impressive 65%. We think YouTube, Amazon Instant Video, iTunes video and BBC iPlayer are also growing fast. In the traditional MVPD sector, there is lots of activity that may affect us on the margin. Verizon is buying the Intel Internet MVPD system and recently bought a CDN (EdgeCast) and streaming software 23  firm (UpLynk).  These are big investments, so they clearly have big plans.  Sony announced they are  launching an Internet MVPD system this year.  Finally, depending on the decision of the Supreme Court,  Aereo will either have to pay for the broadcast content like MVPDs, or the MVPDs will no longer be  obliged to pay. Within the MVPD ecosystem, there are potentially big shake ups.  In contrast, we  continue licensing and producing more exclusive content for our direct-to-consumer business, and are  relatively unaffected by the big bundle questions.      International  We’re making great progress internationally, with strong member growth and contribution profit/loss  improving sequentially in all of our markets (with the exception of the Netherlands as it had its first full  quarter of operations and thus loss in Q4).  We saw healthy growth in net additions of 1.74 million in Q4  to end the year at 10.93 million members, slightly above our guidance.  As anticipated, Q4 net additions  were down slightly from the prior year Q4, as we launched four Nordic markets in Q4 2012 versus the  relatively smaller Netherlands launch in Q3 2013.    In Q1 of 2014, we are forecasting an almost 60% increase in net additions from the prior year, from 1.02  million to 1.60 million.  We’ve seen increases in consumer brand awareness and likelihood to  recommend across markets as our content offering builds and marketing messages are honed, factors  that help drive the y/y growth in net additions.    Throughout 2013 we made substantial progress in improving our contribution losses - a 30%  improvement over FY 2012 - while also launching a small market.  In Q1, we expect to continue this  progress and expect a contribution loss of ($42) million, a $15 million sequential improvement.    In Ireland, on January 10th, we increased our monthly subscription price for new members by one Euro  from €6.99 to €7.99, bringing Ireland pricing in line with our other Euro-zone countries.  Existing  members in Ireland received two-year grandfathering of their existing €6.99 pricing.  Because of this  grandfathering, there will be no material revenue impact from this change in 2014.  It’s too early to tell  if this change will materially affect our growth in Ireland.      We plan later this year to embark on a substantial European expansion.  Our success this year in  international net additions and shrinking contribution losses confirms our belief that there is a big  international opportunity for Netflix.     Content  We continued to expand our original content offerings in the quarter, launching a second season of  Lilyhammer starring Steven Van Zandt, the first five episodes of our first original animated series for  4  kids, Turbo F.A.S.T., from DreamWorks Animation, original standup comedy specials featuring Aziz  Ansari and Russell Peters and the original documentary The Short Game.    So far, Netflix original series have received over 80 major award nominations and wins, including Emmy  and Golden Globe recognition of House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Arrested Development and  Hemlock Grove.  House of Cards and Orange is the New Black were also included in the American Film  Institute’s list of the best 10 TV series of the year.  Our recently launched original documentary The  Square was also just nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.  We could not be  more pleased with -- and proud of -- our first slate of original content.     Timed for family viewing over the holidays, Turbo F.A.S.T has been very popular with kids around the  world, performing especially strong throughout Latin America.  As we had hoped, the global theatrical  and home video release of the DreamWorks Animation film based on the same characters helped  position the series for success.  Though just launched, Turbo F.A.S.T. is on track to become one of the  most popular kids series ever on Netflix.     The second season of Lilyhammer was our first ever for a Netflix original series. The show is finding a  broader audience, as we have introduced new English speaking characters and more global storylines.  Season 3 has recently begun production in Norway and the creators again plan to add characters that  will further broaden the appeal of this already very international show.     In 2014, we anticipate building on our tremendous momentum with new seasons of House of Cards  (Feb. 14th), Derek, Hemlock Grove, Orange is the New Black, Lilyhammer, and a fully exclusive, final  season of The Killing; as well as additional episodes of Turbo F.A.S.T., and premiere launches of our first  original animated series for adults, BoJack Horseman, and an epic series based on the adventures of  Marco Polo from The Weinstein Co., and additional new kids series from DreamWorks Animation.       We’re also thrilled to continue to bring high quality documentaries exclusively to our members. In  addition to The Square, later this week we’ll globally release MITT, the Gala premiere opening film at the  Sundance Film Festival this year.     Looking into early 2015, we anticipate the release of the first season of Sense8 from the Wachowski  siblings and J. Michael Straczynski, the as-yet unnamed project from the creators of Damages, and  Daredevil, the first series from our recently announced deal with Marvel Television.     Beyond our fully original series, Netflix will exclusively premiere new episodes of Better Call Saul, the  hotly anticipated spin-off of Breaking Bad in the UK and Ireland, throughout Latin America, the Nordics  and the Netherlands. Those episodes will premiere in North America on Netflix following their run on  AMC.  As part of that deal, we expanded and extended our exclusive deal for the entire Breaking Bad  series to all of our territories. The final 8 episodes of the now iconic show will hit Netflix in North  America on Feb. 24th.  Breaking Bad has proven to be a global success for us and we expect Better Call  Saul to be very popular with our members as well.  5  Marketing  In the US we launched in late November a new holiday campaign called “It Just Might Bring Everyone  Together”. The ad is simple and timely and positions Netflix as a part of the holiday/family experience.      We made steady progress in our international marketing efforts this quarter. We launched a new  campaign in Brazil introducing Netflix to a broader audience with positive results in terms of brand  awareness and familiarity of the attributes of our service. We also launched a new advertising campaign  in Canada over the holidays that played into the deep Canadian affection for hockey.    Product  We ended 2013 with our best product ever and one substantially better than a year ago.  Notably during  Q4, we rolled out our new user-interface for TV devices, a material step forward not only objectively in  terms of engagement metrics, but in terms of press and public attention. This user interface is coupled  with our new technology platform for TV devices, which has a smaller footprint and is higher  performing, allowing us to reach lower-powered devices and enabling future growth into new areas.    During the quarter, we also completed the roll out of the Netflix streaming application into Virgin  Media’s set-top box for UK members and have been quite pleased with the implementation and  reception.  We followed up with two similar platforms based on the same technology, Denmark’s Waoo!  which went live in Q4, and Com Hem in Sweden, which was just recently launched.  We anticipate rolling  out our first domestic MVPD integrations soon with some of the smaller MVPDs.      At CES this year, we promoted Ultra High Definition (UHD) 4K technology with several key consumer  electronics partners, announcing that House of Cards season 2 will be in 4K as well as all 5 seasons of  Breaking Bad, and our future original series. 4K streams are encoded at 15.6Mbps, well within reach of a  significant minority of our members, and the reach of capable 20Mbps broadband connections will  continue to grow.  Since the number of 4K displays sold in 2014 and the number of available hours of 4K  content both will be relatively modest, the short-term impact of 4K is mainly on consumer perception of  Netflix as a leader in Internet TV.    We continue to invest in personalization for content discovery, which adds value to our content catalogs  by presenting more relevant content to each user, driving more hours of viewing and better retention.   In January, we received our second Emmy Award for Technical Achievement in recognition of our  personalization technology.      6  Net Neutrality  Unfortunately, Verizon successfully challenged the U.S. net neutrality rules.  In principle, a domestic ISP  now can legally impede the video streams that members request from Netflix, degrading the experience  we jointly provide. The motivation could be to get Netflix to pay fees to stop this degradation.  Were this  draconian scenario to unfold with some ISP, we would vigorously protest and encourage our members  to demand the open Internet they are paying their ISP to deliver.     The most likely case, however, is that ISPs will avoid this consumer-unfriendly path of discrimination.   ISPs are generally aware of the broad public support for net neutrality and don’t want to galvanize  government action.       Moreover, ISPs have very profitable broadband businesses they want to expand. Consumers purchase  higher bandwidth packages mostly for one reason: high-quality streaming video.  ISPs appear to  recognize this and many of them are working closely with us and other streaming video services to  enable the ISPs subscribers to more consistently get the high-quality streaming video consumers desire.    In the long-term, we think Netflix and consumers are best served by strong network neutrality across all  networks, including wireless.  To the degree that ISPs adhere to a meaningful voluntary code of conduct,  less regulation is warranted. To the degree that some aggressive ISPs start impeding specific data flows,  more regulation would clearly be needed.       DVD  6.9 million DVD members continue to value the tremendous selection we offer on DVD.      Contribution profit was roughly stable at $110 million.  We expect $98 million in contribution profit for  Q1, which reflects the postal rate increase implemented this month and higher seasonal usage.         In the coming months, we’ll begin using dvd.netflix.com on our envelopes and on the DVD web pages.  The dvd.netflix.com logo will feature our iconic envelope in a nod to our DVD-by-mail heritage,  representing the huge selection that DVD offers; nearly every movie ever made.       Free Cash Flow and Capital  Free cash flow was $5 million in Q4 compared to $48 million of net income, mostly due to cash spending  on content being higher than P&L expense.  While our cash and equivalents has risen to $1.2 billion, we  anticipate embarking on substantially more international expansion and originals funding over the next  few years.  Given the current favorable interest rate environment, we think a prudent step in Q1 is to  7  raise an additional $400 million of long-term debt on terms similar to our $500 million raise last year.  At  $900 million of total long term debt, we will have an extremely modest debt to equity ratio.       Business Outlook  Starting this quarter we are providing you our internal forecast numbers for the quarter in the table at  the beginning of this letter.  This internal forecast is based upon the first few weeks of the quarter, the  historical pattern and other factors.  This is our raw internal best-guess forecast, so we should land  above it sometimes and below it sometimes.      Our goal in this modest change of communication is to increase transparency and to simplify our  message.      Summary  It’s been a good year for Netflix.  People around the world want what we offer: consumer-in-control  Internet television.     Sincerely,                                                                                         Reed Hastings, CEO               David Wells, CFO                8  Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview at 2 p.m. Pacific  Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

      "In 2016, we generated $8.3 billion in global streaming revenue (35% y/y growth) and finished the year with 93.8 million members on 19.0 million net additions vs. 17.4 million in 2015. This quarter marks the 10-year anniversary of our launch of streaming. The next decade will be even more amazing and ​ ​ tumultuous as internet TV supplants linear TV, and as we strive to remain a leader. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast In Q4, global streaming revenue grew 41% year over year to $2.4 billion, while contribution profit rose 74% year over year to $470 million (20% margin). Operating profit totaled $154 million (6.2% operating margin) against guidance of $125 million, while net income amounted to $67 million, compared with our forecast of $56 million. Net income included a -$22 million foreign exchange adjustment booked in other expense due to the strength of the US dollar. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We added 7.05 million net new members globally in the quarter, against our forecast of 5.20 million and last year's Q4 performance of 5.59 million. This was the largest quarter of net additions in our history and was driven by strong acquisition trends in both our US and International segments. Domestically, we added 1.93 million members in the quarter, exceeding our forecast of 1.45 million and 1.56 million in the year-ago quarter. Combined with 15% ASP growth, revenue increased 27% year-over -year to $1.4 billion. US contribution margin expanded 395 basis points year-over-year to 38.2%. Margin improvement was greater than expected due primarily to higher-than-forecast revenue and the timing of content deals. International membership grew by 5.12 million in Q4, against a forecast of 3.75 million and 4.04 million in the year-ago quarter. Over 47% of our total members are now outside of the US. This growth was very broad based geographically as our original content continues to be well-received all over the world. ASP for the international segment rose 13% year over year (excluding a -$21 million impact from currency). International contribution loss was -$67 million, compared with our forecast of -$75 million, as content spend was slightly lower than expected owing primarily to timing. In Q1, we project 5.2 million net adds with 1.5 million in the US and 3.7 million internationally. Our anticipation for a year-over-year decline in domestic net adds reflects a difficult comparison in the year ago quarter where we exceeded our net adds forecast by 27%. Similarly, in our international segment, we will lap our Rest of World launch in January of last year. We also expect a greater membership impact from our content slate in the second half of 2017. On a sequential basis, we believe our strong Q4 results likely pulled forward some net adds from Q1’17 to Q4’16. Since our global expansion is proceeding well, we intend to grow our global operating margin for many years ahead. We’ve been around a 4% annual operating margin for the past two years, and we are targeting about 7% for the full year 2017 based on current F/X rates. From here, we will seek to steadily increase revenue and operating margin as we balance growth and profitability. We are in no rush to push margins up too quickly, as we want to ensure we are investing aggressively enough to continue to lead internet TV around the world. In Q1, we are forecasting a 9% operating margin, higher than our full year target due to the timing of content spend, including moving House of Cards season 5 from Q1 to ​ ​ Q2. 2We anticipate the international segment will be slightly contribution profit positive in Q1. We plan on investing over the remaining quarters of 2017 internationally and, as a result, anticipate an international contribution loss in Q2. On a full year basis, we expect international contribution loss to improve substantially year on year. Content We are learning rapidly how best to match content with audience tastes around the world. It is clear to us that high quality content travels well across borders. For instance, our global originals like Marvel’s ​ Luke Cage, The Crown and season 3 of Black Mirror continue to generate excitement and excellent ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ viewing all across the world. Similarly, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life debuted in the top 10 in every ​ ​ territory. Guillermo Del Toro’s Trollhunters, launched in December, is tracking to be our most-watched ​ ​​​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​​​ ​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ kids original and is performing particularly well in our newer territories. We closed the quarter with the release of The OA, a mind-bending, multi-layered supernatural drama that is a great example of the ​ ​ bold, creative storytelling we’ve aimed to support. Gratifyingly, our first Brazilian original series 3%, a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic thriller, premiered as one of ​ ​ ​ the most watched originals in Brazil and played well throughout Latin America. Moreover, bucking conventional wisdom, millions of US members have watched the show dubbed and subtitled into English, making 3% the first Portuguese language television show to travel meaningfully beyond Latin ​ ​ America and Portugal. We continue to invest in local programming to complement our content offering and as a means to introduce new members to our global library. We are focusing on local content that travels pan-regionally or across multiple territories, such as Japanese anime and Turkish dramas. In this vein, we announced a long-term deal with Red Chillies Entertainment, the film production company of Shah Rukh Khan, who is considered by many to be the biggest movie star on the planet. Netflix is now the exclusive ​ ​ global home for Khan’s new films and members will enjoy exclusive SVOD access to dozens of popular Red Chillies films from the past several years. It’s amazing to think that we launched original programming on Netflix in 2013 and in just four years, our original series accounted for five of the top 10 most searched TV shows of 2016 globally, including ​ ​ Stranger Things at #1, according to Google trends. On January 8, we were honored that The Crown ​ ​ ​ ​ received the Golden Globe Award for Best TV Series (Drama), while Claire Foy won the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a TV Series (Drama) for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II. Later this month, The Screen Actors Guild Awards, the most widely voted-on major awards for TV and films, will ​ ​ feature eight individual Netflix original series with 17 nominations, the most of any network. We are incredibly excited about all the projects we have underway for our global members, no matter their age, taste or cultural background; in 2017, we plan to invest over $6 billion on content on a P&L basis (up from $5 billion in 2016). 3Product and Partnerships  In Q4, we launched offline viewing, which allows members to download content to iOS and Android  devices. Our goal is to make Netflix as accessible as possible to members in countries and locations (such  as subways and airplanes) with limited and/or expensive bandwidth. We are pleased with the initial  results and, as expected, enjoyment of offline viewing is greatest in emerging markets, where the  broadband infrastructure is less robust. In Q4 we also launched on Comcast’s X1 set-top boxes, and the  integration has pleased our members who now can use their X1 remote control and user interface to  access Netflix as they do their other TV networks.   Net Neutrality  Weakening of US net neutrality laws, should that occur, is unlikely to materially affect our domestic  margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our  relationships with ISPs stable.   On a public policy basis, however, strong net neutrality is important to support innovation and smaller  firms. No one wants ISPs to decide what new and potentially disruptive services can operate over their  networks, or to favor one service over another. We hope the new US administration and Congress will  recognize that keeping the network neutral drives job growth and innovation.   Competition  Internet video is a global phenomenon. Amazon Prime Video expanded recently to match our territory  footprint, while YouTube remains far larger than either of us in terms of global video enjoyment  minutes. Video consumption is growing on Facebook, and Apple is rumored to be adding video to its  music service.  Satellite TV operators are moving to become internet MVPDs, such as ViaSat to ViaPlay in  the Nordics, DISH to Sling, and DirecTV to DirecTV Now. Insurgent firms such as Molotov.tv in France and  Hulu are building native-internet interfaces for TV network bundles. CBS is releasing a major original  series (​Star Trek​) exclusively on its domestic SVOD service (with us as international partner).  Finally, the  BBC ​has become​ the first major linear network to announce plans to go binge-first with new seasons,  favoring internet over linear viewers. We presume HBO is not far behind the BBC. In short, it’s becoming  an internet TV world, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Netflix as we strive to earn  screen time.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Q4 free cash flow totaled -$639 million vs. -$276 million last Q4 and -$506 million in Q3’16. The  sequential increase was largely due to the timing of content payments, including our growing slate of  self-produced originals. Producing more owned content creates some lumpiness in our working capital  needs. We expect our FCF to be around -$2 billion in 2017 vs. -$1.7 billion in 2016, with FCF loss  improving sequentially in Q1’17.    4  We are funding our working capital needs through the debt market. In October, we raised $1 billion of  senior notes with a coupon of 4.375%, which will reduce our weighted average cost of capital. We will  continue to be a regular issuer of debt to finance our investment in original content as we balance our  cash needs with the carrying cost of interest expense.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: ​October 2016​, ​July 2016​, ​April 2016​,  January, 2016​, ​October 2015​, ​July 2015​, ​April 2015​, ​January 2015​.      Summary  In 2016, we launched globally (excluding China) and made good progress. But there remains a lot to  learn to make Netflix as popular abroad as it is in the US.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 809-5360      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures  This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-​GAAP financial measure of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves, and to free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non​-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non​-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-​GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.  5    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding the acquisition impact of our content slate; growth of  internet TV; impacts on our business from competition; localization efforts; content strategy, including  local content, original and licensed content investments; impacts of changes to net neutrality laws; ratio  of cash spending on content to P&L spend; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total  and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic  (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating  margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including,  without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to  compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in  consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service  Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company provides internal forecast  numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers  based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake  no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after  the date of this shareholder letter.      6      7 Netflix, Inc.

To remind everyone, the quarterly forecast we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. On an absolute basis (as opposed to relative to forecast), US net adds are down compared to one year ago (1.9 million this Q4 versus 2.3 million for Q4 2013). In October, we judged the leading factor of the similar decline in Q3 y/y net adds to be our May price change. Since then, with additional research, we now think that the decline in y/y net adds would have largely taken place independent of the price change. We’ve found our growth in net adds is strongest in the lower income areas of the US, which would not be the case if there was material price sensitivity. Additionally, we implemented a similar price change in Mexico during Q4, and saw no detectable change in net additions. We think, instead, the reduction in y/y net additions is a natural progression in our large US market as we grow. We have built in flexibility to our business model in terms of how quickly we grow content and marketing spend, so we intend to keep US contribution margins growing even with lower membership growth. This year we plan to increase US contribution margins from 30% in Q1 to about 32% in Q1 2016 to about 34% in Q1 2017, etc. We’ll re-evaluate the margin progression model again in early 2020 when we hopefully achieve 40% contribution margins. It is increasingly clear that virtually all entertainment video will be Internet video in the future. We believe there is big growth ahead in the US market for Netflix, even if we may not get there in a straight line of 6 million annual net adds. We’ll continue to improve our content, our marketing and our service, to eventually achieve “must have” status in most households. Our international segment is growing very nicely with net adds of 2.43 million members in Q4, compared to 1.74 million a year ago. Our initial set of markets (Canada, Latin America, the UK, Ireland, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands) achieved contribution profitability in Q3 and continue to grow. Our launch in Q3 in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg went well and our new original content is particularly popular. With all of the additional new original content set to premiere in 2015, it will be a big year for us in France, Germany and our other recently launched markets. We’ve successfully built big demand for Netflix from Argentina to Finland, due in part to the overall shift from linear to Internet TV. In late Q1, we’ll be launching Netflix in Australia and New Zealand. There are numerous local competitors and a thirst for movies and TV shows from around the world. Later in the year, we’ll launch additional major countries, in keeping with our global strategy. 2Our international expansion strategy over the last few years has been to expand as fast as we can while staying profitable on a global basis. Progress has been so strong that we now believe we can complete our global expansion over the next two years, while staying profitable, which is earlier than we expected. We then intend to generate material global profits from 2017 onwards. We already offer Netflix in about 50 countries and have learned a great deal about the content people prefer, the marketing they respond to and how to best organize ourselves for steady improvement. Acceleration to 200 countries is largely made possible by the tremendous growth of the Internet in general, including on phones, tablets and smart TVs. We intend to stick to our core ad-free subscription model. As with our initial round of international expansion, we’ll get some things wrong and do our best to fix them quickly. For most countries we have a good idea of the best approach for Netflix to take. For China, we are still exploring options — all of them modest. We’ll learn a great deal if we can successfully operate a small service in China centered on our original and other globally-licensed content. That is our preference, for the next few years, if we are able to acquire the necessary permissions. It is advantageous for Netflix to become global in many ways. The big one is absolute size (faster to $10B in revenue) because that revenue allows us to develop and license more content for our members and improve our service. A second is being able to source great stories from around the world and deliver them to the world. A third is the efficiency and influence of being a unique global licensor that provides worldwide distribution. With the growth of the Internet over the next 20 years, there will be some amazing entertainment services available globally. We intend to be one of the leaders. Content Looking at our original content performance over the last few years, there have been so many impressive aspects: how this effort, begun in 2012, has improved perceptions of the Netflix brand; how we’ve had a good start with 45 Emmy, 10 Golden Globe and two Academy Award nominations and several wins in just two years; how success with one great creator leads to new opportunities for other projects; how producing around the world with incredibly diverse talent is working for us; how much we feel we are just scratching the surface. But there is one real shocker; last year our original content overall was some of our most efficient content. Our originals cost us less money, relative to our viewing metrics, than most of our licensed content, much of which is well known and created by the top studios. We will continue to grow the percentage of our content spending dedicated to originals for the next several years. This will mean more cash usage, which means more debt. We factor interest cost into our originals budget as we try to make each project more efficient and effective than studio content we’d otherwise be licensing. 3Marco Polo has struck a chord across all Netflix territories, generating substantial viewing over the holiday season. It has a 93% Audience rating from Rotten Tomatoes compared to 96% for House of Cards and 96% for Game of Thrones for their first seasons. They are all incredibly entertaining shows. We intend to debut a second season of Marco Polo in 2016. We are thrilled to offer exclusively the controversial comedy, The Interview, to our US and Canadian members beginning this Saturday, Jan. 24 - just thirty days after it debuted in theaters and pay-per-view. Our first original feature film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II: The Green Destiny, is now in post production and will debut on August 26 in all of our markets. We expect to open the film on select IMAX screens the same day as its release on Netflix. This year, we are launching 320 hours of original series (new and returning), films, documentaries and stand-up comedy specials, triple the amount of original programming Netflix released in 2014. In Q1, we are premiering Season Three of House of Cards, the new Tina Fey and Robert Carlock comedy The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt starring Ellie Kemper and Bloodline, an intense family thriller from the creators of Damages that stars Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, Norbert Leo Butz, Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard. Our original documentary Virunga just secured our second back-to-back Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature and What Happened, Miss Simone?, a look at the life of the legendary singer Nina Simone, will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this week and at the Berlin Film Festival in February. Beginning this quarter, and in current Netflix territories outside the US and Canada, Netflix will be the exclusive home of Better Call Saul, Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad prequel that focuses on attorney Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk). In many territories outside of the UK, we just premiered the second season of the critically acclaimed British drama, The Fall with Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. For an overall view of our original content slate and upcoming premiere dates, please click here Product We have continued to deliver a variety of algorithmic and data improvements that put better choices in front of members. We are also pioneering offering new high-quality video formats, delivering UHD-4K for House of Cards and Marco Polo. Soon we will be offering High Dynamic Range video (HDR) which captures and renders pictures with more realistic peak brightness in the highlights, and may be a more significant step forward in viewing pleasure than UHD-4K. We will start building our library to deliver in HDR as new TVs become available from several manufacturers this year. Having supported the vast majority of Smart TV devices with a Netflix app, we are now turning our attention to more operator devices and set-top boxes. Following our success with Virgin Media in the UK, we have added British Telecom and TalkTalk on the YouView STB in the UK, Deutsche Telecom STBs in Germany, Bouygues, SFR, and Orange STBs in France, Proximus in Belgium, and DISH STBs in the US. The BT and Orange partnerships include a new payment capability, similar to what we offer on AppleTV. 4Members can elect for BT/Orange to bill on our behalf and the appeal of a single bill seems to be attractive. Marketing Each quarter a greater percentage of our marketing dollars is spent promoting our exclusive content as we believe it is the best way to drive consumer demand for Netflix. Our biggest campaign in Q4 was for Marco Polo, which we launched globally in early December. Separately, our highly targeted campaign behind the Netflix original documentary Virunga is continuing into Q1 with its Oscar nomination. In Q4, we also executed more modest campaigns behind King Julien to spur family viewing over the holidays and shared a moment of Netflix love with our Airport commercial timed to Thanksgiving travel in the US. Looking forward, we are launching campaigns for The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Better Call Saul (internationally) and Season 3 of House of Cards. We were pleased last week on the release of the YouGov Brand Index showing US brands with the most positive buzz, with Netflix at #3, up from #12 in 2013 and another indicator of how our brand is continuing to build momentum. Strong Net Neutrality People around the world increasingly view Internet access as a necessary utility -- Finland even made fast Internet access a legal right. Recently President Obama echoed the same themes in his call for the FCC to take bold steps to be able to ensure a low-cost high-speed Internet. The support for strong net neutrality continues to grow. Competition There is no news yet on timing or price of HBO’s expansion of a direct-to-consumer model to the US. Their Nordics’ offer is priced about the same as Netflix but the content offering includes only HBO and other original series, and not the breadth of movie content HBO offers in the US. Verizon and Redbox shut down their Netflix streaming competitor after about one year of operation. CBS launched its CBS All Access streaming service which, like Hulu, has commercial interruptions. Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Yahoo are all increasing their original programming efforts. Shomi and CraveTV launched in Canada. In many of our international markets, we face competition from both stand alone OTT services (Clarovideo in Mexico, for instance) and ones associated with incumbent broadcasters (CanalPlay in France). In Australia we will face strong competition this year, and look forward to getting started later this quarter. Piracy continues to be one of our biggest competitors. This graph of Popcorn Time’s sharp rise relative to Netflix and HBO in the Netherlands, for example, is sobering. 5MVPDs around the world are moving as they can to on-demand cloud-DVR models. Dish and Sony are launching “Internet MVPD” services. In general, Internet TV is going mainstream, which both increases the size of the market and brings new competitors. It couldn’t be a more exciting time in our industry! DVD Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight 5.8 million members, adding $89 million in contribution profit in Q4. The comprehensive selection of titles available on DVD and Blu-ray includes new release films, major TV shows (including HBO and Showtime series) and much more. Global Expenses, Income & Tax Rate On a pro-forma basis (without the tax reserve release described below) net income would have been $45 million, compared to a forecast of $27 million, due to lower than expected international losses and tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the 2014 R&D tax credit (independent of the tax reserve release). Our global technology and general and administrative costs increased year on year in support of continued international and content expansion. Our Q1 guidance reflects a sequential increase in these costs primarily related to adjustments in annual market compensation. In Q4, we resolved certain prior year tax audits, primarily related to R&D tax credits, resulting in the release of $39 million in reserves from the prior open tax periods. We also expect a favorable effect on our future effective tax rate of around 2% due to a lowered reserve rate on the R&D credit going forward. Because of our international expansion plans for 2015, we expect full year operating income for 2015 to be lower than full year 2014. Free Cash Flow & Capital We finished the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents. Given we are investing faster in content (this Q1 will show a step up in cash use with all the original projects launching in the quarter) and the current favorable interest rate environment, we intend to raise at least a billion dollars, pending market conditions, of additional long-term debt in a similar manner to last year. Over the next few years we expect to continue financing our original content expansion with long-term debt. As long as the maturities are spread out, and the interest cost is built into our content budgets, we think long-term debt is the best way for Netflix to finance the production of content. 67  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2014, July 2014,   April 2014,  January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013.

Management  believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax  reserves provides useful information as these measures exclude benefits that are not indicative of our  core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric  because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance, US  contribution margin and domestic performance, spending on original content, global expansion and  profitability, product improvements, operating expenses, cash flow and debt financing, member growth  domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in- home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could                      9  cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in  our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.  The Company provides internal  forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast  numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                              10 Netflix, Inc.

      "On January 1st, just a few hours after the quarter closed, we crossed 75 million members. Our quarter-end 74.76 million members put us at over 17 million net additions for the year, showing how much the world is embracing Internet TV. We think we’ll grow by over 6 million members in Q1 given our expansion of Netflix to virtually everywhere but China. We bring great stories from all over the world to people all over the world. Our summary results and Q1 forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast In the fourth quarter, we added a record 5.59 million members as our big shows such as Narcos and ​ ​ Marvel’s Jessica Jones helped us grow membership to 74.76 million. This 5.59 million compares to a ​ forecast of 5.15 million and to prior year net additions of 4.33 million. For Q1, we are forecasting 6.10 million net additions vs. prior year of 4.88 million. On earnings, we stayed profitable in Q4 despite foreign exchange headwinds, and delivered operating income of $60m and net income of $43m. We expect similar modest operating income results for Q1, assuming current foreign exchange, as we invest in our international expansion. As a reminder, the guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report, and we strive for accuracy in our guidance. In September, we launched in Japan, followed by Spain, Portugal and Italy in October. We are very pleased with the first few months of membership growth in these markets. Our international contribution loss of $109 million in Q4 increased sequentially due to these launches. We anticipate Q1 international losses of about $114 million. In early January at CES, we announced the availability of Netflix everywhere in the world except China. Pricing is comparable to our existing plans and we have added support for Korean, Arabic, and Simplified & Traditional Chinese languages. Our move into 130 additional countries broadens our addressable market by 190 million broadband homes, on top of the 360 million we counted at the end of 20151. While the opportunity is large, our growth in these new markets will unfold over many years as we improve our service. We are starting by primarily targeting outward-looking, affluent consumers with international credit cards and smartphones. As with every market we’ve launched, our approach is to listen, learn and improve rapidly, adding more content, additional languages and a better Netflix experience over time. Our global availability sets us up for continued growth for many years and we continue to expect material global profits beginning in 2017. In Q4, average subscriber price grew 4-5% y/y around the world, excluding the impact of foreign currency (-$106 million y/y impact on revenue). In the US it was 4.3%, leading to 21% year over year growth in streaming revenue. We are seeing increased adoption of our Ultra-HD plan ($11.99) as more UHD TVs are purchased and as we are a leading source of UHD content for consumers. In the US, we ended 2015 with nearly 45 million members, although our Q4 US net adds were down year over year, as expected (1.56m actual versus 1.90m prior year). Our high penetration in the US seems to be making net additions harder than in the past. Our forecast for Q1 US net additions is 1.75m, against a prior year actual of 2.28m. New credit/debit card rollover continues to be a background issue. In Q2 and Q3, we’ll be releasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering on the HD plan and they will have the option of continuing at $7.99 but now on the SD plan, or continuing on HD at $9.99 a month. Given these members have been with us at least 2 years, we expect only slightly elevated churn. Our 2020 US contribution target remains at 40% and we are already at 34%. 1 Source: SNL Kagan and Euromonitor. 2In the last remaining major market, China, we have work and uncertainty ahead. We are building relationships, understanding the market, and seeking the conditions we require to provide our service to entertainment lovers there. Our expectations are modest and long-term. We may be able to get started this year and thus deliver on “whole world by end of 2016” or it may take longer. Most of our focus is on the 130 countries we launched on January 6, which are now embracing Netflix as a new entertainment option. Content In Q4 ‘15, we launched an unprecedented number of original series and films, while maintaining a high bar on quality. We unveiled five new original series in Q4, including Marvel’s Jessica Jones and Master of ​ ​ ​ None, starring Aziz Ansari. Both combined with Narcos, Sense8, Marvel’s Daredevil and Bloodline to ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ claim six of the Top 10 new TV shows of 2015 according to IMDB. In late December, we debuted a ​ ​ ten-part documentary series Making a Murderer, which has enthralled audiences and critics alike and ​ ​ ​ ​ triggered a national conversation on fairness of the American criminal justice system. ​ ​ Our first original feature films also premiered in Q4. Beasts of No Nation, a gripping journey into the ​ ​ world of African child soldiers from writer and director Cary Fukunaga and starring Idris Elba, was a favorite of critics and has picked up several major awards nominations. Adam Sandler’s first Netflix original film The Ridiculous Six, which debuted globally on December 11, was the most viewed movie on ​ ​ Netflix in every territory the week of its debut and the most-viewed movie ever on Netflix in the first 30 days on service. Two of our original documentaries, What Happened, Miss Simone? and Winter on Fire, ​ ​ ​ ​ are both nominated for Academy Awards, our third and fourth nominations in three years for best documentary feature. In 2016, we plan to launch over 600 hours of original programming, up from about 450 hours in 2015. Beyond the sheer volume of content, the breadth of our original programming will continue to expand with current plans for new seasons of 30 or so original series (including The Crown and The Get Down), ​ ​ ​ ​ eight original feature films, 35 new seasons of original series for kids, a dozen documentaries, and nine stand up comedy specials. We are now in our fourth year of original programming and we are putting special emphasis on shows that families can enjoy together, including the upcoming Fuller House, new seasons of Unbreakable ​ ​ ​ Kimmy Schmidt, and Stranger Things. We are also stepping up our non-English language original ​ ​ ​ productions, including Marseille, a French political drama starring Gerard Depardieu, and then, shows ​ ​ from Italy, Japan, Mexico and Brazil. We expect some of these series to gain fans well beyond the markets in which they were made. Increasingly, our goal is to own more of our original programming to allow for greater creative and business control and to ensure global access to content. We are currently actively managing productions spanning the globe from Cambodia to Venice Beach. 3The growth of Netflix has created some anxiety among TV networks and calls to be fearful. Or, at the ​ ​ other extreme, an NBC executive recently said Internet TV is overblown and that linear TV is “TV like God ​ ​ ​ intended.” Our investors are not as sure of God’s intentions for TV, and instead think that Internet TV is ​ a fundamentally better entertainment experience that will gain share for many years. The challenge for traditional media companies, most of whom see the future pretty clearly, is to use the revenue from Netflix and other SVOD services to fund both great content and their own evolution into Internet TV networks. Seeso, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, CanalPlay, HBO Now, and CBS All Access are the beginnings of these efforts. Our titles are watched on the go and at home on a wide range of devices, making measurement of the viewing of any given title difficult for third parties. We don’t release title-level ratings as our business model is not dependent on advertising or affiliate fees. Instead, we release “ratings “ for Netflix as a whole every quarter with our membership growth report (75 million and counting!). It is member viewing and satisfaction that propels our growth. Product We have been innovating in support of our global launch, focusing on adding new languages, new payment options and fine-tuning our algorithms for our growing number of content catalogs. Additionally, this involves expanding and deepening our partnerships with device makers and mobile and TV operators to reach and serve our members around the world. We recognize that in some parts of the world, mobile is the primary way many people access the Internet. We are improving our mobile experience, including sign up, credentials & authentication, the user interface, and streaming efficiency for cellular networks. In Q4, we began rolling out complexity based encoding. By encoding videos based on the type of content ​ ​ (a visually complex action movie vs. a simpler kids animated title, for example) rather than just based on the amount of bandwidth available to a member, we can deliver higher resolution streams at lower bit rates, resulting in bandwidth savings. We have long used a blacklist to prevent cross-border content viewing via proxies and “unblockers.” Recently, we have begun to use a new blacklist and other techniques, as are other SVOD services, as desired by content licensors. Ultimately, our goal is to let members around the world enjoy all the content we have through global licensing. Marketing Promoting high quality, exclusive titles continues to be the best driver of consumer demand for Netflix. Our recent new market launches reflect this philosophy, and our all-digital, content-led marketing approach is working. Our brand strength is rising in many studies, including a #2 ranking reported in ​ ​ AdWeek for the USA. Around the world, our all digital approach makes us efficient and relevant to active ​ Internet users everywhere. 4Competition Our focus on “winning moments of truth” means that we compete with all of the activities that consumers can engage in during their leisure time, such as reading a book, playing videogames, watching linear TV, movie theatre-going, etc. Given the broad array of options, we are privileged that our members around the world continue to devote more time to Netflix, streaming 42.5 billion hours in 2015, up from 29 billion hours in 2014. In addition, looking at just the online segment, the most recent Sandvine data illustrates that our share of peak North American downstream Internet traffic continues to grow. Please note that the deployment of complexity based encoding, as described above, will result in what appears to be slower growth in Netflix traffic in future third-party reports such as Sandvine (which measures peak megabits, not peak viewing hours). As we have said previously, Internet TV will likely have multiple winners as the various services are not direct substitutes for each other given differing sets of content. A closer look at the Sandvine data shows that the entire Over-the-Top category is growing as consumers increasingly embrace Internet TV and on demand viewing and, even better, this growth is coming at the expense of piracy. 5Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow amounted to -$276 million in Q4 and -$921 million for the full year 2015. As a reminder, our investment in originals, particularly owned content, requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content, which will continue to dampen free cash flow. We finished Q4 with debt of $2.4 billion, unchanged from the prior quarter, and with cash & equivalents and short-term investments of $2.3 billion. Given our expected cash needs, we are likely to raise additional debt in late 2016 or early 2017. We are managing our balance sheet to lower our blended cost of capital over time, while maintaining financial flexibility. Despite being FCF negative as we grow our original content and invest in international, our bonds trade like a BB credit (vs. their single B rating) due, in part, to the long-term growth of Internet TV globally and our low debt to market cap ratio, which provides bond investors with a very thick cushion of protection. DVD Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve more than 4.9 million members. We are pleased that our DVD business is managing the decline well, despite increasing postal costs, generating $80 million in contribution profit in Q4.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 809-5360      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures  This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the r​elease of tax reserves​, and to free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  7  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However,  these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding growth of international markets; expansion to China;  churn related to price changes; volume and titles of future content offerings; original content strategy;  growth of internet TV; raising capital; member growth domestically and internationally, including net,  total and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming  and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings  per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on January 29, 2015.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should  anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to  update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.      8                                                                                                                                                          9 Netflix, Inc.
