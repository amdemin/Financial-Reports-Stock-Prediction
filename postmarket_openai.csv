The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.1 per cent on Thursday, its biggest daily decline since March 9. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 sank 0.7 per cent.
Tesla shares plunged 9.7 per cent, its biggest single-day drop since early January, after the electric-car maker said on Wednesday its profit margins slipped as a series of price cuts aimed at boosting sales weighed on earnings.
Netflix lost 8.4 per cent, having missed sales estimates and posting lower than expected guidance for the third quarter. It was the stock’s biggest one-day drop since December 2022.
Large tech companies have underpinned much of the rally on Wall Street since the start of the year, as investors have ridden the wave of artificial intelligence hype. There have also been expectations that global interest rates would not increase much further.
The Wall Street rally “was very tech-driven and if you look at what the rest of the market did, it was pretty flat since the beginning of the year”, said Anthi Tsouvali, multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets.
“We talk about this euphoria, because we are reaching new highs [ . . . ] but at the end of the day it’s driven by a very small part of the market and that is why it could be very volatile if tech earnings are not as good as everyone expected,” she added.
Feeding in to the tech sector jitters, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company lowered its outlook for 2023, saying that enthusiasm about AI might not compensate for the overall slowdown in global demand.
Shares of Dutch chipmaker ASML slipped 4.9 per cent, even as the company reported that demand from China boosted its orders in the second quarter. 
Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 ended the day 0.4 per cent higher, France’s Cac 40 added 0.8 per cent and Germany’s Dax rose 0.6 per cent. 
Meanwhile, the number of US applications for jobless claims fell to 228,000 in the week ending July 15, the lowest level since mid-May, signalling continued labour market resilience in the face of rising interest rates. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the figure to reach 242,000.
“It takes time for interest rate hikes to filter down into the real economy, with many economists predicting lay-offs to pick up in the second half of this year,” said Tom Hopkins, portfolio manager at BRI Wealth Management.
Following the jobless figures, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which moves with inflation and growth expectations, rose 0.10 percentage points to 3.84 per cent. The two-year yield, which moves with interest rate expectations, rose 0.07 percentage points to 4.82 per cent.
The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday, although lower than expected inflation data last week suggested its tightening cycle could soon end. 
Markets forecast the European Central Bank will next week lift its benchmark deposit rate by the same amount to 3.75 per cent, but are divided on whether rates will increase beyond that following policymakers’ dovish remarks earlier in the week.
“Central banks might finally be near the end of their current rate-hiking cycle, particularly after some positive numbers on inflation over recent days,” said Henry Allen, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank.

The streaming video company estimated revenues would hit $8.24bn in the second quarter, less than the $8.47bn expected by Wall Street analysts, according to an earnings release on Tuesday. Its shares initially fell more than 10 per cent in after-hours trading before rebounding and recovering those losses.
Netflix said in a letter to shareholders that the “paid sharing” service — which lets customers share their account with people outside their household for a fee — had resulted in a “cancel reaction” after it was launched in some markets including Canada and Spain.
That initially hurt “near-term” growth in its membership numbers, but Netflix said the crackdown ultimately led to higher subscriptions and revenue as the borrowers activated their own accounts. In Canada, the paid subscriber base was now higher than before the launch of the “paid sharing service”, the company said.
Netflix said about 100mn households “share” their accounts globally. According to Morgan Stanley estimates, Netflix could potentially convert 20-30 per cent of those to paying members.
“This account sharing initiative is about creating a larger base of potential members,” Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive, said during a video presentation on Tuesday. “That’s why were focused so much on execution.”
After Netflix shocked investors last April by revealing it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade, it announced two new programmes to increase its revenue: the crackdown on password sharing and the launch of an advertising-supported service, which debuted in November.
It said it was delaying the wider launch of paid sharing to the US and three other markets from the first quarter to the second, which would shift “some of the membership growth and revenue benefit” from the second quarter to the third. This could also cause engagement with Netflix’s service to shrink “modestly” in the short term, it said, although it expected that would recover over time.
Despite the rollout delays, Netflix said it was confident it could hit its full-year targets, adding it was “pleased” with the recent paid-sharing launches.

Spencer Neumann, Netflix chief financial officer, said new ad-supported services were still in “start-up mode”.
But the company said it had not seen many customers ditch their high-priced subscriptions in favour of the cheaper ad-supported options as some had feared.
Sarandos warned that a potential Hollywood writers’ strike next month would be “devastating” to the creative community and to viewers, but he added that Netflix has a strong foundation of international content that would help it weather a strike. “We really don’t want [a strike] to happen,” Sarandos said. “We’re at the [negotiating] table”.
Netflix added 1.7mn subscribers around the world in the first quarter, below Wall Street forecasts of 2.3mn. Its revenues rose 3.7 per cent to $8.16bn but net income dropped from $1.6bn to $1.3bn. Earnings of $2.88 a share were ahead of investor expectations.
The company also announced that it would wind down its DVD rental programme in September after 25 years, marking the end of a service that was the core of Netflix’s business model when it was founded.

But, by his own admission, the 62-year-old is no inventor. 
As a computer science student at Stanford University in the 1980s he dabbled in reimagining hardware, with ambitious plans for a “foot mouse” that would avoid hands straying from the keyboard. He generously summed up that project as “a disaster”. 
Netflix’s early experimentation was not much better. The 25-year-old company first tested movie downloads in 2000 when it explored alternatives to mailing out rental DVDs in red envelopes. But broadband was so slow that it took more than half a day for the film to download — and incurred internet fees higher than the movie cost to rent. 
While admiring “one in a billion” inventors such as Elon Musk, Hastings saw himself playing a different role. He told the Financial Times in 2020: “For the rest of us it is really about trying to build a system.”
He did so with a disruptive force that not only sealed the fate of his rental rival Blockbuster, but ultimately reset the Hollywood model for making and selling video entertainment. 
John Malone, the billionaire who mastered the shift to cable, joked that Netflix shareholders should build a statue to the founder; Hastings floated Netflix as a one dollar stock in 2002 and built it into a $150bn business trading at about $336 a share. Hastings himself owns a stake worth more than $1.6bn today.
“He really broke the mould with his success,” Malone said in November. “He was there early . . . A lot of people are regarding [Netflix] now as a foundational programming service. I just attribute it to his excellent execution.”
Under the plan announced this week, Hastings will continue as an executive chair but hand day-to-day operations to two co-CEOs — Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters — who have worked alongside him for about 25 years and 15 years respectively. They take the reins of a company that has swapped the role of disrupter for that of dominant incumbent: Netflix is now the only profitable big streaming service in the world, with a subscriber base of 231mn and annual content budget of roughly $17bn. 
The challenge for Sarandos and Peters is whether the Netflix system can keep pace with breakneck change still ripping through the entertainment business — and actually deliver returns that come anywhere close to those of the traditional television model in its heyday. 
One rival media executive compared Hastings’ influence on the industry to “the pied piper” — luring legacy media companies towards their demise with an expensive bet on subscription streaming that has left them nursing billions in losses. “None of us know whether this business will pay off,” he said. 
Hastings’ chosen successors, Peters, a polyglot with a background in tech, and Sarandos, who has built the entertainment side, are confident that cable-style margins of 40 per cent plus are ultimately possible as streaming matures. Sarandos on Thursday described Netflix’s business as still in its “infancy”; it accounts for just 8 per cent of television viewing in America. 
But investor faith in Netflix is not what it was. Shares in the streaming group were hammered last year after subscription growth stalled and the stock remains 55 per cent off its 2021 peak. 
The succession plan effectively keeps in place the top trio running the business, with reallocated roles. Both Sarandos and Peters not only saw Hastings borrow ideas to shape the Netflix business, but often saw the projects through themselves. 
Peters was managing the digital division when Netflix eventually did break into streaming in 2010, a full five years after the emergence of YouTube Driven by Sarandos, who joined Netflix in 2000 and has been co-CEO since 2020, the company then deliberately mimicked HBO in moving from distribution into making its own shows. Sarandos’s big bet was placed without explicit approval from Hastings: spending $100mn on House of Cards, one of Netflix’s first breakout hits.
But it remains to be seen what role Hastings, whose singular style has shaped the Netflix corporate culture, will continue to play at the company. He prides himself on clarity and radical honesty, which at times has unnerved his partners. 
The Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph recounts in his memoirs how Hastings edged him out as chief executive in 1999 by calling a meeting, straddling a chair, then presenting a deck of slides on his shortcomings. “He pursed his lips, looking down at the screen like it was a set of cue cards . . . ‘I’m worried about us’,” Randolph described Hastings as saying. “‘Actually, I’m worried about you. About your judgment’.” 
Hastings’ proposed solution was making Randolph co-CEO. It is exactly the same kind of unorthodox leadership arrangement Hastings shared with Sarandos, and that Sarandos will now share with Peters. 
Given their long history working together, some analysts have put little significance on the leadership transition; Tim Nollen of Macquarie argued it was not a “meaningful” change given Hastings was “still on top” as executive chair.
But within Netflix the change in titles is marking a shift in responsibilities that has been evident for some time. Hastings, who spreads mild terror among staff with his habit of turning office meetings into urban strolls, is already less hands-on than in the past, delegating most Hollywood decisions to Sarandos, according to people familiar with the matter. 
This may allow his successors to take more risks in diversifying the business. Hastings used to tell colleagues “strategy is pain” as he explained why it was important for Netflix to show discipline and resist straying from its core model of subscription video. 
Recommended
He was one of the last to hold out against creating an ad-supported tier of membership, which Netflix rolled out last year. Some insiders envisage his successors potentially now having more liberty to experiment with gaming, or other distribution models for the company’s shows, whether in cinemas or by licensing its content outside its platform. “There won’t be a radical shift but they might test the boundaries more,” said one Netflix veteran. 
Hastings walks towards the stage exit at a pivotal point for the media industry wrestling with how to make streaming profitable. “Rather than being the new sliced bread, investors and executives have accepted that streaming is, in fact, not a good business — at least compared to what came before,” wrote analysts at SVB MoffettNathanson. 
Netflix, though, has begun to deliver modest positive returns, with $3bn in free cash flow expected this year. Hastings, who has long had an aversion to companies hoarding cash, has pledged to return anything above minimum levels — roughly two months of revenue — to shareholders. 
Meanwhile friends say Hastings’ personal focus will now also be on giving away his own fortune through philanthropy. “That’s the mission,” said one colleague. “He wants to die poor.”

The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House is a charming new Japanese-language series created for Netflix by Palme d’Or-winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters). Based on a popular manga, The Makanai captures the quiet, quaint and codified existence of the trainee geisha (or maiko) living in a small boarding school. Unexpectedly, it is set in the present day.
Then again, time seems to be almost suspended here — both in the modernity-shunning customs followed at Saku House and the unhurried approach of the series itself. This is the kind of drama that luxuriates in detail and takes its time to draw out moments of beauty, feeling and wisdom from daily life.
At the centre of the story are two 16-year-old girls who hope to become the next heirs of an ancient but long-fading tradition — an art now largely reduced to performing for sozzled salarymen. While Sumire (Yuuki Luna) demonstrates all the required poise and refinement, her friend Kiyo (Nana Mori) proves ungainly and distracted by whatever’s happening in the kitchen. Though disappointed to be expelled from the training programme, the latter quickly finds herself in her element when given the chance to take over as the house cook (or makanai).
The specific terms and various maiko practices are sparingly explained in a show that pleasingly makes little direct attempt to spoon-feed western audiences or fetishise geisha culture. More generally, it seems averse to high narrative stakes, interpersonal friction and cynicism. While not oblivious to the strains of this most unusual lifestyle — in which girls are literally prohibited from letting their hair down — The Makanai often simply lets minor tensions dissipate in lingering shots of Kiyo’s culinary concoctions.
Some viewers might find themselves craving more of a plot to bite into. But this tale of friendship, small pleasures and gentle longing is nothing less than a warming, spirit-nourishing delicacy.

Good morning. Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix in 1997, is stepping down as chief executive, he announced last night after the streaming company released its latest quarterly results.
After helping to launch Netflix as a DVD-by-mail service Hastings transformed it into one of the most powerful studios in Hollywood. In a blog post last night he said it was time to “complete my succession”.
Chief operating officer Greg Peters has been promoted to co-chief executive alongside Ted Sarandos, who was in charge of programming during Netflix’s massive investment period and promoted in 2020 to co-chief executive alongside Hastings. 
The change at the top of Netflix’s follows one of its most difficult years. It ended 2022 with 231mn paid subscribers, up 8mn for the year which was the slowest annual growth in a decade.
Netflix stunned investors in April by revealing its decades-long growth spurt had come to an end, forcing it to take steps to shore up its business. It introduced a cheaper ad-supported streaming service, in partnership with Microsoft, and announced a crackdown on password sharing.
Last night Netflix said it was “pleased with the early results” of its new service as it announced fourth-quarter net income dropped to $55mn from $607mn in the same period the year before.
But investors welcomed news that 7.7mn new subscribers had joined to the platform in the final three months of last year, sending shares 6 per cent higher in after-hours trading.
1. Central bankers pledge to ‘stay the course’ on their anti-inflation fight Investors have been put on notice that central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic will “stay the course” to cool down their economies and tame high inflation.

4. Japan’s inflation rises at record pace Japan’s core inflation rate rose to a new 41-year high of 4 per cent last month on the back of a weaker yen and heavy exposure to the increasing cost of imported commodities. The reading adds to mounting market pressure on the Bank of Japan to abandon its yield curve control policy which has helped maintain ultra-low interest rates.

Hastings, who launched Netflix in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail service, wrote in a blog post that he had been increasingly delegating management in recent years. Now is “the right time to complete my succession”, he added.
“Our board has been discussing succession planning for many years (even founders need to evolve!),” Hastings, 62, wrote. “I’m so proud of our first 25 years, and so excited about our next quarter of a century.”
Chief operating officer Greg Peters has been promoted as co-chief executive with Ted Sarandos, who was in charge of programming during Netflix’s massive investment period and promoted in 2020 to co-chief executive alongside Hastings. 
Netflix shares jumped more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading.
The change comes as Netflix has lost more than a third of its market value in the past year, after revealing its decade-long growth spurt had come to an end. Sarandos and Peters will be charged with regaining momentum and leading Netflix through a more austere era for the entertainment industry. 
Hastings will stay on as executive chair, following the past examples of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. The billionaire founder said he plans to “spend more time on philanthropy” but “remain very focused on Netflix stock doing well”.
The change atop Netflix came as the company reported it added 7.7mn subscribers in the fourth quarter, well above expectations, thanks to popular programming such as the Addams Family spin-off Wednesday and the Harry & Meghan documentary series. Netflix had forecast it would add 4.5mn subscribers in the quarter. 
Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “While Wall Street sags with the weight of recession fear and Federal Reserve jitters, Netflix’s huge beat on subscriber numbers has injected some much-needed optimism into the mix.”
Netflix stunned investors last April when it revealed it had lost subscribers, triggering a punishing stock market revaluation of the entire US media industry. After the “Netflix Correction”, Wall Street has become more sceptical of the streaming video market, increasingly focusing on profitability and forcing big entertainment groups to be more cost-conscious. 
Netflix ended 2022 with 231mn paid subscribers, adding 8mn for the year, its worst annual growth in a decade. In a letter to investors, the company said “2022 was a tough year, with a bumpy start but a brighter finish”. 
Recommended
Revenue in the quarter climbed to $7.9bn, up 2 per cent from a year ago. Net income dropped to $55mn in the quarter, down from $607mn in the same period a year ago, a sharp decline that the company attributed in part to the strong US dollar. Operating income declined to $550mn from $632mn. 
The company spent $4bn on content in the quarter, down from $5.7bn at the same time last year.
Shares in Netflix have recovered somewhat from last year’s lows, gaining 9 per cent this year. But its market valuation of $141bn is still about half its peak reached during the coronavirus pandemic. 
As growth in subscribers slows, Netflix has taken two significant steps to shore up its business: introducing a cheaper version of its streaming service with advertisements, and trying to limit password sharing, a practice it had largely ignored when growth was red hot. 
Recommended
Netflix moved quickly to create an advertising tier in partnership with Microsoft, launching the platform in November for $7 a month. The company on Thursday said it was “pleased with the early results”. 
With these two potential new sources of revenue, Netflix has stopped providing guidance to investors on its number of new subscribers — a symbolic shift for a company whose stock price soared for years based on subscriber growth. 
The promotion of Peters, who played a big role in Netflix’s ad tier launch, “is an indication of how much the ad business means to Netflix”, said Paul Verna, analyst at Insider Intelligence. 
“In the same way that Sarandos’ earlier elevation . . . was a sign of Netflix’s maturation from a tech company to a film and TV studio, the current shift puts advertising in the centre of the picture, alongside content.”

In November, Netflix introduced a new subscription service in which viewers have access to a more limited selection of titles for a lower price in exchange for watching ads.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Jeremy Zimmer, head of the United Talent Agency, said this new strategy “changes the game” in terms of how the streamer should compensate creative talent.
“A show that does really well will get more advertisers and more revenue will flow to Netflix,” he added. “Therefore, our clients who created that show should be compensated for that additional revenue.”
Netflix, which launched its ad-supported service to offset slowing subscriber growth, has long resisted profit-sharing arrangements. Instead of offering traditional “back end” payments that allow talent to earn more from a successful show, Netflix buys out all rights upfront.
But Zimmer says Netflix’s launch of an ad-supported service has altered that formula.
“They’ve changed all the rules [by saying] it’s no longer an ad-free environment,” he said. “There’s a different revenue stream coming in that they had said wasn’t going to be there.” 
Netflix is likely to resist attempts by UTA or its rivals, including Creative Artists Agency and WME, to seek new sources of revenue tied to performance. However, talent agencies are trying to use the streamers’ advertising push — Disney Plus also launched an ad tier this month — as an opportunity to persuade them that aligning artists’ financial interests with the performance of programmes is good for both parties. 
The nature of the advertising business means that there will be more transparency on how shows perform than Netflix has allowed in the past. With the launch of the ad service, Netflix will now allow detailed data to be collected by Nielsen ratings — allowing talent to access more information about how well their programmes perform on the platform. In theory, this could give artists leverage to bargain for more money when they produce a hit. 
However, analysts say they do not expect meaningful profits from Netflix’s advertising business any time soon. “They’re off to a slow start” with the advertising service, said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital. “It looks like 2025 before we see any real benefit from it.” 
Netflix is missing its advertising viewership guarantees by as much as 20 per cent, according to a report this month in Digiday, which suggested the streaming service was returning cash to advertisers as a result.
Nollen noted that the ad service was still new, but he said he was surprised by a lack of promotion of the advertising tier. “Netflix is in a bit of a quandary,” he added. “They don’t want to dilute themselves” by incentivising full-price subscribers to switch to the lower-cost advertising tier. 
Zimmer said there had not been serious discussions with Netflix about profit-sharing arrangements because it is “all relatively new”. But he said when clients launch new programmes on Netflix, “they will want to build in opportunities to get compensated for shows that are successful and are deemed successful by advertisers and audiences”.
Recommended
The streaming industry itself is facing serious headwinds, including slower subscription growth and investor impatience with the billions of dollars that the traditional Hollywood groups have lost trying to build up their services. A potential strike by the Writers Guild of America when its contract ends in May could also deal a blow to studios. 
Morgan Stanley analysts wrote this month that if the streaming services launched by traditional studios were unable to deliver “meaningful” profits in the next two years, some would need to “give up and/or consolidate”. 
Some could choose to emulate Sony’s “arms dealer” strategy of selling content to streamers or even traditional TV networks, the analysts added.
Zimmer said Netflix and other streamers would do well to sell their shows to rivals. 
“All the streamers are now realising, ‘Wow, we could use additional revenue’,” he added. “Maybe those shows don’t need to just sit on our servers alone.” 
Syndicating their content to broadcasters would allow the streamers to generate extra revenue — and open another profit opportunity to the creative talent, Zimmer said. “The revenue they get from that would be a way to share proceeds from the creators.”

Last quarter, the streaming group shocked both Wall Street and Hollywood with an abrupt end to its decade-long growth spurt, triggering a dramatic fallout likened to the dotcom crash. 
This quarter, Netflix won by setting expectations low, and exceeding them — with the help of a new season of the hit show Stranger Things.
Shares climbed more than 7 per cent in after-hours trade after Netflix said 970,000 subscribers cancelled their accounts in the second quarter. It was the worst subscriber loss in its history but as Netflix had forecast twice as many defections, investors were relieved. 
“It’s tough . . . losing a million and calling it success,” cofounder and chief executive Reed Hastings said plainly on Tuesday. “We’re talking about losing 1mn instead of 2mn. Our excitement is tempered by the less bad results.” 
With a recession looming and inflation soaring to 40-year highs in the US, Netflix is grappling with a more cost-conscious consumer. While it previously lured people in as a cheap alternative to their pricey television bills, Netflix is now the most expensive option among a sea of copycat streaming services.
“The cost of living crisis [is] having a profound impact on all companies,” said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. “No one is immune.” 
This spending squeeze is happening at the same time that the world’s largest media and tech companies have unleashed a gutsy, expensive effort at competing with Netflix. 
“Competition has gotten to levels that are sort of absurd,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at LightShed, referring to the steep spending commitments new entrants have made. “I don’t think there is anyone in the investment community who anticipated [Comcast’s] Peacock losing two and a half-billion dollars”. 
The impact has been harsh and sudden. As recently as January, analysts predicted Netflix would add 20mn subscribers in 2022. Now, Netflix is hoping to break even for the first nine months of it. 
Netflix was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the first half of this year. Its market value has shrunk from more than $300bn in November, to $90bn. 
The “Great Netflix Correction”, as it has become known in Hollywood, has triggered anxiety about the streaming business model and the future of entertainment. Netflix’s stumble has set off a sell-off across media stocks, wiping tens of billions in value from giants such as Disney and Warner Bros.
Morgan Stanley this week described the situation as the “first streaming recession”. “Streaming video revenues may prove more vulnerable than expected to a global recession and lower consumer spending levels,” warned analyst Ben Swinburne. 
Bank of America cautioned that streaming has “very quickly become a commoditised product”. 
The question for Wall Street and Hollywood is whether this downturn is temporary or if the streaming business is fundamentally less attractive than executives had assumed. 
Netflix’s second-quarter results provided lukewarm evidence supporting the former. The company is on a path back to growth, albeit by a hair — predicting it would sign up 1mn subscribers in the third quarter. 
Cancellations have been most acute in the US and Canada, Netflix’s largest market, where nearly 2mn people ditched their accounts in the first half of this year.
At $15.49 a month for its most popular plan, Netflix costs more than its major competitors, including Disney Plus and HBO Max, which charge $8 and $15, respectively. 
Netflix is also being challenged on its content. Co-chief Ted Sarandos on Tuesday described his company’s programming as “delivering hits on top of hits”. But the company has fallen behind HBO in Emmy nominations — one measurement of quality — with 105 to HBO’s 140 this year.

It is unclear how many streaming services households will pay for, particularly in a recession, and Netflix has lost its “bulletproof, must-have status”, said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. 
Already there are more video streaming subscriptions than there are people in America, with 380mn subscribers to a population of 330mn, according to data company Ampere Analysis. Globally, Netflix has previously touted a pool of 1bn potential customers who have access to the internet. Now, Nathanson warns the potential market may be closer to 400mn. 
So far this year, Asia-Pacific is the only area where Netflix has been adding subscribers. The company signed up 2.2mn people in the region in the first half of 2022 while losing customers in the rest of the world. 
Netflix executives this week appeared to be in damage control mode, taking shots at rivals and offering up data to prove its dominance. 
One example: during the 2021-22 television season, Netflix drew more viewership than broadcasters CBS and NBC combined, according to Nielsen figures provided by Netflix. Other data points were less compelling, such as Twitter engagement for Stranger Things outpacing that of Paramount’s Top Gun Maverick — a movie that made more than $1bn at the box office. 
Despite this year’s slump, Netflix remains far ahead of rivals, with 221mn subscribers to Disney Plus’s 138mn. Netflix also makes a profit on its streaming service, unlike its competitors, and expects to end the year with $1bn in free cash flow. 
Recommended
Nonetheless, Netflix management has announced sweeping changes to revive subscriber growth. It is working with Microsoft to offer a cheaper service that serves advertisements, and plans to limit password sharing, through which it estimates 100mn households are watching Netflix for free. 
These moves won’t take place until 2023. For now, Netflix will depend on hits to carry it through the second half of the year. It will be helped by a new season of The Crown and the sequels to Knives Out and Enola Holmes. “We’re executing really well on the content side,” Hastings said. 
But the streaming group still lacks its own Star Wars or Harry Potter. Ross Benes, analyst at Insider Intelligence, warned: “unless [Netflix] finds more franchises that resonate widely, it will eventually struggle to stay ahead of competitors that are after its crown”.

The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite climbed as much as 1.9 per cent in early trading, though it trimmed some of its gains after The Information reported that Google-parent Alphabet would temporarily pause new hiring.
The Nasdaq closed 1.6 per cent higher for the day, while the S&P 500 gained 0.6 per cent.
Shares in Netflix rose 7.4 per cent after it said late on Tuesday that subscriber numbers fell less than forecast during the second quarter.
The company added that it was “confident and optimistic about the future”, even as its subscriber projections for the third quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. 
Scott Devitt, analyst at Stifel, said that with signs of stabilisation in the subscriber base emerging, “we believe the prospect of a prolonged period of subscriber losses is becoming increasingly unlikely”.
Netflix’s share-price move on Wednesday ricocheted across US equity markets, pulling other film, television and music streaming providers higher. Walt Disney gained 3.8 per cent, while Spotify added 4.2 per cent and streaming platform and hardware business Roku jumped 6.9 per cent. All of those stocks had dropped sharply after a warning over subscriber growth from Netflix in late April, in a sign of the group’s perception as a bellwether for shifting consumer sentiment and household finances.
However, Alphabet was an exception to the positivity across most of the tech sector. The company erased its earlier 1.3 per cent gain to close flat after the report on its hiring plans.
It was the second time this week that reports of a hiring slowdown at a big tech group had knocked markets, following a Bloomberg report about Apple on Monday. 
Elsewhere in equity markets, Europe’s regional Stoxx 600 gauge closed 0.2 per cent lower.
Government debt markets were broadly steady following a brief rally in eurozone bonds earlier in the session. The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, seen as a proxy for borrowing costs across the eurozone, slipped 0.02 percentage points to 1.20 per cent. Yields fall when prices rise. The equivalent US Treasury yield rose 0.02 percentage points to 3.03 per cent, while the 10-year UK gilt yield dipped 0.05 percentage points to 2.14 per cent.
Those moves came ahead of a much-anticipated European Central Bank monetary policy meeting on Thursday. The ECB has widely signalled that it is poised to lift borrowing costs for the first time since 2011 as it tackles red-hot inflation. 
Rate-setters are expected to discuss the possibility of an extra-large 0.5 percentage points rise — a scenario that would take its deposit rate back up to zero for the first time since 2014 — but analysts remain divided over the likely scale of tightening.
“I don’t see 50 basis points tomorrow,” said Sabrina Kanniche, senior economist at Pictet Asset Management. “The growth outlook has deteriorated because of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the implications for gas supply.” 
The euro slipped 0.5 per cent against the dollar to $1.017.

In the week Netflix is releasing its biggest-budget movie, the streaming service has reported it will be moderating growth in its content spending to match a squeeze on subscribers and revenues.
Netflix will spend about $17bn on content this year and is set to keep it around that level. It would have greenlit the $200mn budget for The Gray Man blockbuster action movie, starring Ryan Gosling, in better days, when subscribers were signing up and gorging themselves on content during pandemic lockdowns.
Times have changed. In April, it reported its decade-long run of subscriber growth ended in the first quarter with a decline of around 200,000 users, as competition among streaming services increased and consumers cut back on spending. On Tuesday, it recorded a further 970,000 net losses for the second quarter, although this was good news compared to the 2mn drop it had predicted.
Great content is still key in keeping subscribers, with executives describing it as the company’s “North Star”, driving engagement and viewing “because then we can drive member growth and monetisation around it”.
Franchises are an important part of that, in order to compete with the likes of Disney+ and its Star Wars series. The Gray Man is set to become one, alongside Stranger Things, Bridgerton and others. 
Lex says some subscriber growth should return in the current quarter and the company has committed to creating a tier supported by advertising, a line that it once vowed never to cross, in order to wring more money out of some viewers. It also aims to clamp down on password sharing among its 220mn users.

The video streaming pioneer shocked investors by forecasting that its number of subscribers would fall by another 2mn in the current quarter, to about 219.6mn, after declining about 200,000 in the first quarter. Investors had expected an increase of 2.6mn subscribers. 
Netflix blamed the dramatic slowdown in part on saturation in its biggest markets. But it also acknowledged the impact of rising competition from streaming services launched by traditional media groups such as Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount. Together, these factors had created “revenue growth headwinds”, the company said. 
“We’re definitely feeling higher levels of [market] penetration . . . and heightened competition,” said Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive.
The report from Netflix, published after the market close on Tuesday, marked a reversal in fortune for a company that has shown blistering growth over the past 10 years, and which boomed during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. As it showed signs of slowing late last year, company officials blamed “noise” from the lingering effects of the Covid crisis.
“This was a change in tone”, said Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who noted Netflix rarely even acknowledged that it faced competition in the past. “It sounds like they’re in rebuilding mode.”
Netflix said it would try to jump-start growth by improving the “quality of our programming” and by seeking to charge some of the 100mn households that share other users’ accounts. 
Reed Hastings, co-chief executive, said account sharing, which has always been a problem at Netflix, is coming into focus. “When we were growing fast it was not a high priority, but now we’re working super hard on it,” Hastings said. The company is testing how to charge for shared accounts in markets such as Chile and Peru. 
Hastings also said Netflix planned to launch an ad-supported streaming service — an idea that he had long resisted. “It’s something we’re looking at now and will roll out over next year or two,” he said. “It’s working for Hulu, and Disney is doing it. Those companies have figured it out.”
The report will probably intensify investor concerns about the cost of the streaming wars, and the potential size of the profits at stake. Netflix will spend $19.2bn on content this year, Uerkwitz estimated, as it competes with Amazon, Apple, Disney and others that are investing heavily in streaming.

Spencer Neumann, Netflix chief financial officer, said the company will be “pulling back on some of our spending growth across both content and non-content” over the next 18 to 24 months because of slower revenue growth. “But we will still be investing aggressively into that long-term opportunity.” 
Netflix raised prices in the US and Canada, which cost it about 600,000 subscribers but was nevertheless “significantly revenue positive”, the company said. It also quit streaming in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, costing it about 700,000 subscribers.
This is the second time Netflix has surprised investors this year, after jolting the markets in January with its forecast that subscriber growth would slow significantly in 2022. Its shares are down about 40 per cent this year.

Netflix’s decade-long run of subscriber growth ended in the first quarter and the streaming pioneer admitted worse was to come in the current quarter, triggering a share price drop.

Netflix shares fell by a quarter in after-market trading, suggesting as much as $40bn could be wiped off the company’s valuation when the stock market opens later today. The falls are helping to drag down Nasdaq 100 futures contracts and the S&P 500 index.

Ackman’s decision to exit the world’s largest streaming platform came three months after he amassed a stake worth $1.1bn — making his Pershing Square vehicle a top-20 shareholder in Netflix — and pledged to focus on the “long-term horizon”.
The move by Ackman capped a painful 24 hours for Netflix, which lost close to 40 per cent of its market value, a decline of almost $60bn, after it revealed that its once-blistering subscriber growth had gone into reverse. 
The New York billionaire investor bought 3.1mn shares in Netflix over the course of a few days in late January at roughly $360 per share. At the time, he said many of Pershing Square’s best investments had “emerged when other investors, whose time horizons are short term, discard great companies”. Netflix closed at $226.19 a share on Wednesday. 
But in a letter to investors, Ackman said Pershing Square had “lost confidence in our ability to predict the company’s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty”. He cited planned changes to Netflix’s business model such as launching an advertising-supported service and clamping down on account sharing. 
Pershing Square declined to comment.
Ackman said the loss on the Netflix investment had translated to a 4 percentage point fall in returns for the Pershing Square Funds this year, leaving the funds down about 2 per cent overall over the same period.
Netflix has lost two-thirds of its market value in the past six months, falling from a peak of almost $310bn in October to $100bn on Wednesday. 
Recommended
The company has been contending with saturation in some of its markets as well as stiff competition from the likes of Disney, Apple and Warner Media, which have spent billions of dollars to break into the streaming market that Netflix pioneered. 
Ackman’s U-turn on Netflix also came weeks after he said he would abandon the aggressive activist campaigns that were a hallmark of his investment career in favour of a more “cordial, constructive” approach. 
In his letter announcing the Netflix share sale on Wednesday, he wrote: “Based on management’s track record, we would not be surprised to see Netflix continue to be a highly successful company and an excellent investment from its current market value.”

There was a surprising yet familiar sight when the mail arrived one day this week at an old neighbour’s house where I’m staying, on a return to the Bay Area.
Among all the flyers and junk mail was a slim red envelope that took me back nearly 20 years. It was a Netflix DVD delivery.
While streaming has succeeded spinning a disc to get your entertainment, the DVD service still exists for people like my friend. He prefers to consume media at a slower pace, get those director’s commentary add-ons and discover the many movies still not available online.
Having physical media delivered is also a way of making you more aware of your subscriptions and their value to you. We reported this week that UK households cancelled video subscriptions in record numbers in the first quarter, as they were forced to take stock of their spending. 
Consumers walked away from about 1.5mn video on-demand accounts as they curbed non-essentials to cope with the cost of living squeeze, reinforcing concerns that the pandemic-fuelled boom in streaming is over. 
Netflix’s earnings last night confirmed the trend. The company said its decade-long run of subscriber growth ended in the first quarter with a decline of around 200,000 users, and a further 2mn expected to be lost in the current quarter. 
The news has sent its shares down 35 per cent today and, as Lex points out, since its peak late last year, Netflix’s stock has crashed more than 60 per cent, reflecting a loss of around $200bn in equity value.
The company explained its biggest markets had reached saturation point and there was rising competition for subscribers from the likes of Apple and Disney’s streaming services.
It aims to shore up the business with higher subscription fees and the development of a lower-priced ad-supported service. It will also put the squeeze on shared accounts — it estimates that at least 100mn users are watching Netflix through shared passwords.
That doesn’t affect me watching a DVD movie with my old neighbour, but all those family and friends sharing out there are on notice that the era of binge-watching online for free is coming to an end.

With Netflix losing almost two-thirds of its market value since November and analysts likening its fall to the dotcom crash, Hastings on Tuesday finally heeded his own advice and admitted that his corporate strategy might be seriously underdressed. 
In the course of an hour on Tuesday, the Netflix founder and chief executive jettisoned his long-cherished principles, reorienting a media group that changed Hollywood to cope with leaner times of slow growth and spending restraint. 
Sharing passwords? In 2016, Hastings quipped “we love people sharing Netflix”. Now, he plans to crack down on the practice; Hastings estimated 100mn people have been sharing accounts.
Competition? For years he has dismissed the threat of Disney, Apple and HBO, insisting Netflix’s biggest competitors were Fortnite, YouTube and “sleep”. On Tuesday he admitted Netflix needs to “take it up a notch” because its competitors have “some very good shows and films out”.
But perhaps the clearest about-turn was on advertising. Having always defended Netflix as an advertising-free zone that allows viewers to “relax” without being “exploited”, Hastings flung open the doors to marketing money. 
Casually dropping the change of strategy during a call with analysts, Hastings announced Netflix would work on a cheaper, advertising-backed version of its service “in the next year or two”.
And spending? Netflix single-handedly created a template for streaming in which the stock market rewarded it for spending more money. The company burnt cash for years while investors applauded its fast subscriber growth and commitment to steadily churning out fresh TV shows and movies. For the first time, the company on Tuesday said it would curb its spending on content. 
“It was shocking,” summarised Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “These guys sounded like any other management team that just didn’t have the answers yet.”
The volte-face is a humbling moment for a company that while its subscriptions soared at the height of the pandemic was confident enough to begin proactively cancelling accounts for people who were not using them. 
After a historic stock market run as one of the big tech ‘FAANG’ companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) soaring to a valuation of nearly $310bn in October, it has shrunk back to $95bn. Shares in Netflix plunged more than 38 per cent on Wednesday alone. 
“We have watched a company go from growth darling to growth purgatory in an instant,” said Nathanson. 
One of the most painful decisions for Hastings may have been on advertising.
His rivals had long predicted Netflix would eventually buckle on an anti-advertising position that Jason Kilar, the former chief executive of Warner Media, recently compared to a “religion”. But few imagined it would come so soon. 
“The way you get a billion [subscribers] is not by continuing to charge a premium price that’s ad-free,” Kilar said. “[Netflix] will absolutely get to that conclusion.” 
Morgan Stanley expects that in the long term, Netflix can make “billions” from advertising, estimating that adverts generate about $3bn in revenue a year for rival service Hulu. 
But the bank’s analysts also questioned whether the option to offer cheaper subscriptions would boost revenues for the company, given that it has already convinced 75mn households in the US and Canada to pay on average $15 a month. “As it migrates customers to an ad-supported tier at a lower price point, can it generate higher overall [revenue]? This is less clear.”
Mark Read, chief executive of the WPP advertising group, said the change in strategy reflected the need to reach new customers and the clear “limits to growth of subscription-only models”. 
“History has shown that successful media companies have both subscription and advertising,” he said. “No doubt the pressure on household budgets as well as the increasing number of subscription offers has focused consumer minds.” 
The challenge for Netflix is to introduce the ad-supported tier of membership without either eating into its existing subscriber base, or devoting too much time and money into building an advertising business that it once saw as a distraction. 
After years as a market leader in video subscription services, Netflix must adjust to the role of latecomer in ad-funded streaming, learning from Disney, Discovery, Paramount and NBC. “There was never any fear that we’re in trouble,” said one former Netflix executive. “The feeling was: we are leap years ahead.” 
It now faces stiff competition from the world’s largest media and technology companies, which have found success with blockbuster television shows such as Apple’s Ted Lasso and HBO’s Succession. 
Among some investors and analysts, there is a sense that Netflix’s lavish spending should yield better programming. “If you spend $18bn on content, I would like to think that you can persuade people to join your streaming platform,” said a top-10 shareholder in Netflix. 
But its share price crash is worrying for the entire entertainment industry, because the biggest US media groups have earmarked more than $100bn for spending on content this year alone to try to emulate Netflix’s model. 
Now, Hollywood is questioning whether Netflix executives seriously overestimated the size of the streaming market. 
Netflix has 222mn paying subscribers, and Hastings has told investors that his “total addressable market” was any household in the world with access to the internet — potentially a billion subscribers. There was plenty of room to grow, and ample space for new competitors, he insisted. 
But as its growth has ground to a halt, analysts are poking holes in these optimistic assumptions. Given questions of affordability and global access to digital payment systems, Nathanson estimates that the “real” addressable market is closer to 400mn.
Equally worrying, he questions whether Netflix has already reached full saturation in the US and Canada, where the company revealed on Tuesday that an additional 30mn people are sharing accounts on top of its existing 75mn subscribers. The number of US pay-TV subscribers during the peak of television in 2011 was about 100mn, indicating Netflix may have tapped out in its largest market. 
This is bad news for other media groups because their valuations have been benchmarked on Netflix. Shares in Warner Bros Discovery fell 5 per cent on Wednesday, while Disney was down 4 per cent and Paramount Global lost 10 per cent. 
Rich Greenfield, an analyst at Lightshed partners, noted the irony that streaming champions such as Netflix and Disney were now embracing advertising, a key pillar of old-media strategy, to revive their businesses. 
“It is scary if the only way to reinvigorate growth is offering cheaper products that worsen the consumer experience, essentially making it more like the dying linear TV experience,” he said.

The world’s largest streaming service said late on Tuesday that its decade-long run of subscriber growth, which had powered its share price, had come to an end in the first quarter of 2022. The company expects to shed 2mn subscribers in the current quarter, having lost about 200,000 in the previous three months. 
Market saturation, especially in the US and Canada, signalled that it had become “harder to grow membership” in some regions, the company said. 
“We have witnessed a company go from a growth darling to growth purgatory in an instant,” Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note. 
The news reverberated across the media industry, hitting shares in traditional groups such as Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery that have spent billions in an effort to emulate Netflix’s streaming model. Together, video streaming companies are expected to spend in excess of $100bn this year on content to attract subscribers to their services. 
Netflix acknowledged competitors were eating into its audience, and vowed to improve the quality of its programming. Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, said the company’s content “is simply not resonating relative to the level of spend”, which he put at about $17bn a year. 
“Netflix should be creating significantly more must-see TV series and movies that become ongoing franchises,” he said. 
The company also pledged to crack down on the estimated 100mn households that share other users’ accounts. “It feels like something Netflix should have done anyway and years ago,” said one top-10 shareholder in the company. “Not just because they missed their quarterly numbers.”
Reed Hastings, co-chief executive, said the company was working “super hard” on the crack down. 
Hastings also surprised investors by announcing plans to launch an advertising-supported version of Netflix — a step he had long resisted. But that move, which analysts generally welcomed, is expected to take “a year or two”, he said. 
The top-10 Netflix shareholder said an ad-supported streaming service had the potential to cannibalise the company’s existing business “but it could also allow Netflix to grow a new cohort of subscribers”.
Walt Disney, owner of the Disney Plus streaming service, fell as much as 5.8 per cent by lunchtime in New York, while streaming platform and hardware business Roku dropped as much as 9.8 per cent. Music streaming service Spotify slid almost 10 per cent.
Streaming services and other companies that prospered in the pandemic had “lost a lot of value during the past few months”, said Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi Group. “The market was expecting this but nobody expected the [Netflix] subscriber losses to be as dramatic as they were.” 
The US S&P 500 index bucked the fall in Netflix shares, trading broadly flat in the early afternoon in New York. But Netflix was a drag on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which was down 0.7 per cent at lunchtime on Wall Street.

Dear Pershing Square Investor, 
Beginning on Friday and over the last several days, we acquired more than 3.1 million shares of Netflix, making us a top-20 shareholder in the company. The opportunity to acquire Netflix at an attractive valuation emerged when investors reacted negatively to the recent quarter’s subscriber growth and management’s short-term guidance. 
. . . We have greatly admired Netflix both as consumers and as investors, but have never previously owned a stake in the company. Netflix is a primary beneficiary of the growth in streaming and the decline in linear TV driven by its superior customer experience, a vast and diverse amount of superb, constantly refreshed content, global improvements in bandwidth, and the proliferation and continuous improvement and convenience of devices on which one can watch. 
. . . We are pleased to add Netflix to our portfolio. Many of our best investments have emerged when other investors whose time horizons are short term, discard great companies at prices that look extraordinarily attractive when one has a long-term horizon. 
At the time it was seen by many as big but smart $1.1bn trade. But then Netflix reported the first decline in subscriptions in a decade. 
And guess what just landed from Ackman:
Dear Pershing Square Investor:
Today, we sold our investment in Netflix, which we purchased earlier this year. The loss on our investment reduced the Pershing Square Funds’ year-to-date returns by four percentage points. Reflecting this loss, as of today’s close, the Pershing Square Funds are down approximately two per cent year-to-date.
While we have a high regard for Netflix’s management and the remarkable company they have built, in light of the enormous operating leverage inherent in the company’s business model, changes in the company’s future subscriber growth can have an outsized impact on our estimate of intrinsic value. In our original analysis, we viewed this operating leverage favorably due to our long-term growth expectations for the company.
Yesterday, in response to continued disappointing customer subscriber growth, Netflix announced that it would modify its subscription-only model to be more aggressive in going after non-paying customers, and to incorporate advertising, an approach that management estimates would take “one to two years” to implement. While we believe these business model changes are sensible, it is extremely difficult to predict their impact on the company’s long-term subscriber growth, future revenues, operating margins, and capital intensity.
We require a high degree of predictability in the businesses in which we invest due to the highly concentrated nature of our portfolio. While Netflix’s business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company’s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty. Based on management’s track record, we would not be surprised to see Netflix continue to be a highly successful company and an excellent investment from its current market value. That said, we believe the dispersion of outcomes has widened to a sufficiently large extent that it is challenging for the company to meet our requirements for a core holding.
One of our learnings from past mistakes is to act promptly when we discover new information about an investment that is inconsistent with our original thesis. That is why we did so here.
By our back-of-the-envelope calculations, that’s a nearly $400m loss in a matter of weeks. Shoulda held on to that interest rate hedge!

Netflix’s shares lost as much as a quarter of their value today, after the streaming service disappointed on subscriber numbers and investors continued to bail out of stocks that have prospered in the pandemic.

The streaming company projected after the close of trade on Thursday that it would add just 2.5m subscribers in the first three months of this year, far fewer than the 4m it added in the first quarter of 2021 and well below analysts’ expectations that also stood at 4m. 
Netflix shares dropped 24 per cent in early trading on the Nasdaq, wiping about $55bn from the group’s market value. The Nasdaq 100 stock index was down about 1 per cent, while Europe’s Stoxx 600 tech index was down 2.4 per cent. 
Netflix’s disappointing forecast came as Peloton was forced to rush out preliminary second-quarter earnings to shore up investor confidence after CNBC reported the company was temporarily halting production of its connected fitness products. Shares in Peloton, one of the biggest beneficiaries of early Covid-19 lockdowns, fell about a quarter following the report on Thursday, but had pared losses slightly in a 4 per cent rebound on Friday. 
John Foley, Peloton’s co-founder and chief executive, said “rumours that we are halting all production of bikes and [treadmills] are false” but conceded the company was “right-sizing our production . . . as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves”. Peloton’s market value has plummeted in the past 12 months to about $8bn from $50bn.
Netflix and Peloton were among a clutch of “stay at home” stocks that investors snapped up at various stages of the pandemic, and the sharp decline in their share prices came amid growing investor angst over shares in companies that benefited from the pandemic. 
BlackRock’s “virtual work and life” ETF, which was launched during the first wave of the virus to track companies that would prosper from people spending more time at home, is trading close to a record low. It is down 9 per cent since the start of the year and more than 40 per cent below the peak it hit last year.
Shares in Zoom, the videoconferencing service that became ubiquitous as people worked from home, have fallen more than 15 per cent since the start of the year, including a 3 per cent drop on Friday morning. Other pandemic beneficiaries such as e-signature specialist DocuSign and Netflix rival Roku have tumbled more than 20 per cent in 2022.

Investors have also soured on the tech sector in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more quickly than previously expected to tame soaring inflation. Higher rates reduce the value investors place on future profits of fast-growing companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index entered correction territory this week, meaning it has fallen more than 10 per cent from its high in November. 
Streaming companies such as Netflix and Disney Plus hoovered up huge numbers of subscribers during the 2020 lockdowns, but a return to more normal routines has hit growth just as they are spending billions of dollars on content to attract and keep viewers. 
Netflix also undershot expectations for net new subscribers in the last quarter of 2021, adding 8.3m versus expectations ranging from 8.4m to 8.7m. That brought the total number of paying customers to 222m.
The slowdown in Netflix subscriber growth came even as it has assembled one of the strongest catalogues of original content since its launch, including the Korean hit drama Squid Game and Don’t Look Up, a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence.
The streaming wars are leading the big services to spend more on content. Netflix said the amount it was spending had compressed operating margins to 8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021 — down 6 percentage points compared with a year earlier. However, Netflix did not spend as much on content as it had forecast. 
Netflix noted that “competition . . . has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering”.
The company acknowledged that the increased rivalry “may be affecting our marginal growth” but said it continued to grow in every country in which its competitors had launched.

Over the past few weeks the streaming group has suffered the most high-profile internal backlash in its history after employees spoke out against allegedly transphobic comments made by comedian Dave Chappelle in a Netflix special titled The Closer. 
Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive of Netflix, last week emailed roughly 150 senior staff defending the segment, pointing to the importance of Chappelle to the company. “Chappelle is one of the most popular stand-up comedians today, and we have a long standing deal with him,” he said.
Chappelle’s hour-long special made frequent mocking references to transgender people and other members of the LGBT+ community. He defended the position of those who argue that a person’s sex is assigned at birth and cannot be altered, while comparing trans identities to the wearing of blackface. “I’m Team Terf,” Chappelle said, a reference to so-called “trans-exclusionary radical feminists”.
Netflix quickly faced blowback from its own employees in addition to human rights organisations, activists and some of its top talent. Comedian Hannah Gadsby called Netflix an “amoral algorithm cult”, while Dear White People showrunner Jaclyn Moore said she was “done” with the company. 
A former senior Netflix executive said the crisis was part of the “ongoing story of Silicon Valley versus Hollywood”, as Netflix has shaken up the television and film business with its emphasis on data and algorithms.
“This is the robots versus creative, sensitive people,” said the executive. “Netflix tries to codify everything. Reed [Hastings, co-founder] sets extremely high ideals, and can you really live up to all those ideals as you keep growing?”
The company’s employees were planning a virtual work stoppage on Wednesday, while activists rallied outside a Netflix building on Vine Street in Los Angeles, with a list of demands for the company. 
As tensions have swelled, Netflix’s employees have leaked to the press both the chief executive’s internal memos and sensitive financial information — an unprecedented rebellion against a company that has prided itself on progressive values and creative freedom.
“Netflix does this under this tech banner of ‘this is about freedom of information and we’re not going to stand in the way of artists’,” said another former executive. “It has almost been a competitive edge to cable television, because [streaming] wasn’t held to the same standards.”
Hastings has made transparency a core part of the company’s unconventional corporate culture, sharing financial information and company salaries widely. The strategy was previously validated by loyalty among staff. “The financial world sees this as reckless. But the information has never been leaked,” Hastings wrote in a book released last year.
But employees in the past week have shared sensitive information about how Netflix assigns a dollar value to a television show, a question that has mystified Wall Street over the years. Netflix spent $24m to make Chappelle’s The Closer, more than the $22m it cost to make the Korean TV series Squid Game, which went on to far greater viewership, according to Bloomberg figures that were confirmed by the Financial Times. Netflix last Friday said it had fired an employee for leaking documents to the media.
Netflix in 2018 hired British public relations executive Rachel Whetstone to lead its global communications. In the past month, senior communications executives in the US and the UK have exited the company. 
The backlash is the first reputational blow in some time for Netflix, which has attracted some of Hollywood’s most talented executives and creatives with the promise of enormous paycheques and creative freedom. Some workers’ salaries were doubled or tripled from their previous employment; others were given raises in the hundreds of thousands of dollars overnight.
Another former executive described the crisis as “inevitable”.
“What has kept this from happening before is that they pay everyone so much,” said the former employee. “You’d be hard-pressed to find a salary under $100,000 at Netflix. I’ve never seen leaks like this, but now the floodgates are a little open.”
Netflix is unlikely to face near-term financial consequences over the matter. Its stock has climbed more than 20 per cent in the past two months as investors cheered the success of Squid Game, which has become the group’s most popular show ever. Netflix doubled its net new subscribers in the third quarter to 4.4m, exceeding forecasts.
However, the controversy has put pressure on Sarandos, Netflix’s most prominent face in Hollywood, who last Wednesday sent a second internal memo reaffirming his stance on Chappelle. 
“Adults can watch violence, assault and abuse — or enjoy shocking stand-up comedy — without it causing them to harm others,” he said. “While some employees disagree, we have a strong belief that content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.”
Critics were quick to point out that 44 transgender Americans were murdered last year, according to the Human Rights Campaign, the highest since the group started tracking in 2013. 
Late on Tuesday night ahead of the walkout, Sarandos tried to offer a mea culpa, stating that he had “screwed up” with internal communications, but continuing to defend the Chappelle programme.
“This group of employees felt a little betrayed because we’ve created such a great place to work that they forgot that sometimes these challenges will come up,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. 
But the comments appeared to stoke the fire further. “We didn’t forget shit,” Terra Field, a transgender Netflix engineer who was suspended last week for crashing a virtual company meeting uninvited, posted on Twitter. “Stop patronising us.”

At the end of March, the streaming giant had 208m customers globally, it said on Tuesday, falling short of its own guidance for 210m.
Netflix said it also expected the second quarter to be slower, projecting only 1m subscriber additions and a “roughly flat” customer base in North America, its largest market. 
“We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year due to Covid-19 production delays,” Netflix told shareholders, warning that the pandemic would create “uncertainty” over its results.
The 4m figure for first-quarter subscriber growth compared with 16m in the same period a year ago, during the first few months of the pandemic. Netflix recorded 37m new subscribers in 2020 overall.
“The pandemic streaming party has firmly come to an end,” said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight.
Netflix shares were down more than 7 per cent shortly after the opening of trading. The stock had climbed only 2 per cent this year, underperforming the broader market, after soaring more than 60 per cent last year to a high.
Shares in Disney, whose Disney Plus streaming service has surged in popularity through the pandemic, also opened lower against the backdrop of a broadly flat market.

Netflix’s revenues in the March quarter were up 24 per cent from the same period last year to $7.2bn, just above analysts’ forecasts for $7.1bn. 
Net income jumped to $1.7bn from $700m a year ago, which the company partially attributed to pandemic-related production delays, keeping costs down.
Some analysts pointed out Netflix had a relatively weak slate of new TV and movie content in the first quarter.
“Even for Netflix, it turns out that fresh, new original content is a critical factor in driving gross subscriber additions,” said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “In short, content spend is a form of subscriber acquisition costs. That simple observation goes to the heart of our debate on streaming and whether or not current valuations are consistent with the long-term dynamics of the business model.”
Netflix predicted that growth would heat up in the second half of the year with the return of hit shows such as Sex Education and The Witcher. The group expects to spend $17bn on content this year, with production up and running in most of the world. 
As its subscriber base has soared, Netflix has increased revenue fast enough to cover both its operating expenses and its content spending, marking a milestone in the company’s history. In January, it announced it would no longer need to raise extra debt to cover the costs of producing television shows and films.
A crucial question for investors has been whether Netflix can maintain its lead over the competition, which includes streaming services from Apple and AT&T as well as Disney, and keep up momentum as consumers seek entertainment outside their homes again. 
Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, told shareholders it did not believe competition was a “material factor” in the disappointing first-quarter subscriber numbers.
Netflix remains well ahead of the streaming pack. Disney Plus last month said it had reached 100m subscribers.

This year it’ll equally apply to a number of well-known equities.
The Coronavirus pandemic proved a once-in-a-generation tailwind for a select group of businesses. Whether you were an online goods specialist, a video conferencing company or a seller of high-end home office furniture, the instant transition to a working-from-home world created the sort of consumer demand that was unthinkable just months before. 
As restrictions ease and inoculation rates soar, for the likes of Peloton, Ocado and Zoom, the question has now changed to one of sustainability. Did the pandemic simply pull forward two to three years of demand? Or has it reshaped each industry so much that growth will consistently be higher going forward?
Last night, we got our first real answer.
Netflix reported its first quarter earnings, and it missed by a margin on its expected subscriber numbers. Here’s the FT take:
Netflix added only 4m subscribers in the first quarter, a sharp slowdown from its pandemic-driven gains last year, as the US began to emerge from lockdown. 
At the end of March, the streaming giant had 208m customers globally, it said on Tuesday, falling short of its own guidance for 210m. 
Netflix said it also expected the second quarter to be slower, projecting only 1m subscriber additions and a “roughly flat” customer base in North America, its largest market. 
Estimates for subscribers was 6.4m, according to CNBC. While second quarter subscriber guidance was even weaker, with the Californian company estimating that it might add only 1m customers, versus estimates or 4.6m. 
Even the usually unflappable chief executive and founder Reed Hastings seemed a bit skittish about the numbers on the ensuing conference call, telling Fidelity’s Nidhi Gupta, “we had those 10 years where we're growing smooth as silk”, before adding that the streaming service was “just a little wobbly right now.”
Judging from the figures, it looks like 2020’s subscriber surge was more a one-off than the new normal. Of particular concern is its Latin American business, where according to research shop MoffettNathanson, despite relatively low market penetration rates, Netflix expected “roughly flattish” growth in the second quarter.
The fundamentals were relatively good. Revenue came in just above estimates at $7.2bn, while net income was a full $1bn higher than the same period in 2020. Part of the profitability boost, of course, is to do with costs: delayed productions meant its content amortisation and related expenses grew slower than expected, boosting margins. The company expects this to continue in the first half of the year, due to “a lighter content slate” and “hence, we believe, slower membership growth”. 
We’re also not sure stable revenues is what investors have signed up for, given the stock trades at a rather pricey 38 times forward Ebitda.
The link between Netflix’s largely junk-bond funded content spend and its subscriber numbers has been one of the focal points for those on both sides of the trade. The bull case has long been that, as it scales, Netflix can reduce its content spend while both maintaining subscriber numbers and raising prices. Revenue, margins and, therefore, profits will follow. 
The bears, meanwhile, don’t believe in this conscious uncoupling between content and subscribers. Any attempt to take its foot off the content pedal will mean maintaining, let alone growing, subscribers becomes a serious challenge. This problem is potentially further exacerbated by Netflix chasing new markets like India, where not only are the revenues per subscriber lower, but tastes far more local. Bollywood content, it goes without saying, is far less fungible across markets than big budget drama like Stranger Things or The Crown. That’s not to mention competitive supply and demand pressures from the likes of streaming rivals Disney, ViacomCBS and Amazon.
Reading too much into a quarter is always an error, but given Netflix’s commentary about the ties between subscriber numbers and content spend, it’s not hard to think the bears might have got this one right. At pixel, Netflix’s shares are down 7.8 per cent to $507.
As for the other stay-at-home stocks? Well, it’s easy for people to say a bad quarter for Zoom, Wayfair and Ocado is “already priced in”. But, looking at the market reaction to Netflix’s results, we’re still not quite sure that’s the case.

Since 2011, when Netflix leapt into original programming with House of Cards, the video streaming pioneer has funded acquiring content through high-yield bonds as it sought to outspend Hollywood studios and build an enticing catalogue. 
Netflix’s latest quarterly figures on Tuesday underscored how successful that strategy had been: the streaming giant had almost 204m subscribers at the end of 2020, it said, having added 37m paying customers last year. 
Some 8.5m of those were added in the quarter to the end of December, eclipsing analysts’ forecasts of 6m. 
“We believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations,” Netflix said in a letter to investors, adding that it would explore stock buybacks.
The shares jumped about 12 per cent in after-hours trade.

The California-based company has delighted investors in recent years despite burning billions of dollars in cash. Over the past decade, Netflix borrowed more than $16bn in debt as it raced to build a war chest of content. During that time, the value of its stock grew by more than $200bn. 
Netflix had promised that as it hooked more customers and raised subscription prices, it would eventually no longer need raise junk debt to fuel its content spending. Critics questioned whether the company would be able to grow quickly enough to outpace its debt payments. 
But Netflix’s thesis has largely played out, helped by a global pandemic that lured people stuck at home under lockdowns to its streaming platform and kept it comfortably ahead in the race for subscribers. Its fiercest rival, Disney Plus, has 87m subscribers.
The majority of sign-ups in the fourth quarter came from outside the US. In October Netflix, raised prices in the US, its largest market, by $1 to $14 a month for its most popular plan. 
Recommended
As subscriber numbers have soared, revenue has grown sufficiently for Netflix to foot the bill of both its operating expenses and its heavy content spending. Revenues in the fourth quarter were up 22 per cent from the same period last year to $6.6bn, in line with analysts’ forecasts. 
Net income fell to $542m, from $587m a year ago, but the company’s cash flow position was significantly improved. For the quarter, the cash outflow was $284m, narrowing from $1.7bn a year ago, and the company said it expected to break even this year and be cash flow positive after that. 
“Rapid subscriber growth means cash flow is on the up, and external finance is apparently no longer needed to plug what was a cash sinkhole,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, adding that the company’s ability to raise prices feeds a “virtuous loop”.
“The [price] hikes allow it to create better content, boost engagement and then shake more pennies from customer pockets, so the cycle goes on,” she said.

It dabbled with its own content from 2006-2008 when its Red Envelope Entertainment division acquired rights to more than 120 films including Palm d’Or winner 4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days. But it wasn’t until House of Cards in 2013 that it started to get serious about original content, in a move that seemed audacious and even overambitious at the time.
We all know what’s happened since then, including appearances in golden Oscar envelopes. Under lockdown, I’ve been seeking out new Netflix series and movies more eagerly than anything on terrestrial television, for the first time.
So Thursday’s announcement — that Ted Sarandos, who has overseen content during the company’s massive investment period, was being promoted to co-chief executive alongside Reed Hastings — is really no surprise. “Ted drove the revolution in our content strategy,” said Mr Hastings.
It is a milestone though, marking Netflix as a major creator as well as distributor, and a huge competitor for Hollywood. Another landmark of 200m subscribers beckons, as it reported adding 10m in the second quarter to reach 193m. It shares are down nearly 7 per cent today after it predicted only 2.5m additions in its September quarter because “growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions”. 
Lex has a different take on future distribution growth disappointing: the astounding subscriber gains of the first two quarters of 2020 may simply be future 2021 and 2022 converts who joined ahead of schedule. As Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates puts it: “If you haven’t subscribed to Netflix during lockdown, the chances are you never will.”

Netflix posted some extraordinary numbers on Tuesday. Just not in the right area.
Apparently I was one of 76m people who watched the fantasy show The Witcher in the first four weeks of its release, which would make it the biggest debut for a Netflix TV series ever. I don't know how many people felt like me — that this was a pale imitation of Game of Thrones — and stopped streaming just as I did in the first half hour, but it may have been many millions as well. Netflix's new metrics count you as a viewer of a series even if you have only watched two minutes of a single episode.
Anyway, what was more concerning for investors was US subscriber numbers. Netflix added only 420,000 in the fourth quarter — below its guidance for 600,000 and well behind the 1.5m it added in the same period a year ago. It blamed price increases and competition from other streaming services.
The rivalry in its home market is intensifying all the time, with AppleTV+ and Disney+ launching and Peacock due in the summer. Analysts at Wedbush expect subscriber growth to “stall to a very slow crawl”, with only 1.5m added in the whole of 2020 in the US and Canada, compared to 23m additions internationally. 
If the US video streaming saga is getting more interesting, so too is the music one. Anna Nicolaou's scoop reveals Amazon Music has passed 55m users, nearly all of them paying subscribers. This makes it a serious contender in a market historically dominated by Spotify and Apple. Apple last summer said it had 60m subscribers to Apple Music, while Spotify remains the market leader with 113m paying subscribers. Analysts says Amazon has been appealing to a different segment of the market, opening up new, older households to streaming. 
1. Saudi Arabia implicated in Jeff Bezos phone hackFrom extraordinary numbers to extraordinary tales. After the Amazon boss and Washington Post owner exchanged mobile phone numbers at a dinner with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman's WhatsApp account was used to hack Jeff Bezos's handset. That's according to a forensic report seen by the FT, which says the hack allowed troves of data to be uploaded from the phone. Saudi Arabia says this is “absurd”. The journalist Jamal Khashoggi, murdered by Saudi operatives, was a columnist for the Washington Post, whose proprietor had commissioned an investigation into how the National Inquirer tabloid got details of his extramarital affair with former TV presenter Lauren Sanchez. The UN says this looks like “an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post’s reporting on Saudi Arabia”.
2. Vodafone hangs up on LibraThe mobile phone operator has becomethe eighth backer to abandon Libra, Facebook’s digital currency initiative, saying it would focus on its own mobile money payments service, M-Pesa as a means to extending financial inclusion.

Now the strategy that has taken it to the commanding heights of Hollywood is starting to look more shaky.
The company has posted the first drop in subscribers in its core US market since 2011, when the company split off its DVD business and prepared the transition to online video. Its shares closed 10.3 per cent lower on Thursday after it revealed it had lost 130,000 US customers in the second quarter. It was the worst day for the stock price in three years, wiping more than $15bn from Netflix’s market value. 
The weak subscriber numbers could not have come at a worse time for the California-based company, stoking fears that Netflix is losing momentum just as Disney, Apple, HBO and NBCUniversal are ready to pounce with their own streaming services, which will launch in the coming months. 
“Does it make us more nervous? Of course — especially given the timing of the Disney+ launch,” said Todd Juenger, analyst at Bernstein. “If Netflix misses subs in the quarters after Disney+ launches . . . we expect the downside effect on Netflix stock will be several times more than usual.”
The results also prod at the heart of Netflix’s business model. The company has delighted investors despite burning $3bn in cash a year, promising that margins would improve as it hooked more customers and raised subscription prices, meaning it would no longer need to keep raising high-yield debt to fund its shows. This week’s results have thrown that thesis into question. 
Netflix raised prices in the US this year by as much as 18 per cent, a move cheered by investors. But the subscriber defections suggest demand is more elastic than executives thought. The price of a standard Netflix subscription now costs $13 a month — a dollar higher than for rival Hulu. 
While Netflix already has a strong grip in its home country, with more than 60m Americans paying for a subscription, analysts have predicted that number could keep rising to as many as 90m. 
As recently as last month, media research group MoffettNathanson estimated the company would reach 88.4m US subscribers by 2025. But on Thursday it warned “that scenario looks downright psychedelic”. 
“This one quarter calls into question many of those 2025 endpoints,” said partner Michael Nathanson, adding that the results bring into question “Netflix’s ultimate pricing power”.
Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant one
Netflix blamed the miss on a weak content offering during the quarter, without elaborating, and Reed Hastings, chief executive, had little in the way of explanation. 
“It wasn’t just one thing,” Mr Hastings said on an earnings call. “It's easy to over-interpret the quarterly [subscriber] adds, which are a bit noisy.”
Netflix says the picture will improve as its flagship shows return with new seasons. The second quarter is usually Netflix’s weakest, and the third brings the return of worldwide hits Orange is the New Black and Stranger Things, with The Crown to follow later in the year. 
But the business is likely to become more challenging as the new wave of rival services looms. From November, Disney’s streaming service will offer thousands of shows and films from popular franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel — at about half the price of a Netflix subscription.
In the next two years, Netflix is also losing fan favourites Friends and The Office, to WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal, respectively. The sitcoms are the number one and two most-watched shows on the platform, according to Nielsen. Netflix has brushed off the issue, arguing the losses would “free up budget for more original content”. 
The global numbers also disappointed. The 2.7m subscribers added worldwide in the second quarter fell well short of Wall Street forecasts for 5.1m new users. 
Netflix’s long-term debt stood at $12.6bn at the end of June, up from $10.3bn in March. It has forecast a free cash burn of more than $3bn this year, although it expects an improvement after that. 
“In the meantime, our plan is still to use high-yield debt to fund our content investments,” the company said, doubling down on its strategy to pump money into its own shows and films to further expand its 152m global subscriber base. Analysts expect the company to invest $15bn in content this year alone.

Until now the company has remained a darling of investors. Although the threat of competition and the recent price rises amount to what JPMorgan analysts called a “wall of worry” around the stock, Netflix shares gained more than 35 per cent this year before peaking in May, compared with a 20 per cent rise for the benchmark S&P 500. 
But observers are now wondering whether the golden age of Netflix is losing its sheen. 
“Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant one,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Missing expectations just when competition for viewers is hotting up is doubly worrying and doubly painful.”

The company added 2.7m subscribers globally in the three months ending in June — well below its guidance for 5m additions and Wall Street forecasts for 5.1m new users. 
Netflix also revealed that it had lost subscribers in the US for the first time since 2011, as customers defected after price rises of as much as 18 per cent earlier this year. 
“There was no one thing” to explain the decline, said Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, adding that “if investors believe in internet TV . . . our position in the market is very strong”. 
Investors showed their disappointment with the results on Wall Street, sending shares down more than 11 per cent in midday trading. 
“Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant one,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Missing expectations just when competition for viewers is hotting up is doubly worrying and doubly painful.”
In the US, its largest market, Netflix lost 130,000 subscribers in the quarter. The company in January raised prices for all US customers. The price of a standard Netflix subscription now costs $13 a month — a dollar higher than rival Hulu. 
California-based Netflix already has a strong grip in its home country, with more than 60m Americans paying for a Netflix subscription. But the latest results “could point to potential saturation in the [US] market,” said Patrice Cucinello, director at Fitch.
Netflix blamed its content slate for the large miss, while adding that its forecasts “strive for accuracy (not conservatism)”.
The company said that it expected the US to return to “more typical growth” in the third quarter, during which two of its biggest original hits, Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black, return with new seasons. Netflix expects to add 800,000 US subscribers in the period.
Netflix has continued to pump billions of dollars into its own shows and films. Analysts expect the company to invest $15bn in content this year. It has justified the splurge with fast subscriber growth: at the end of June, Netflix had 152m subscribers across the globe.
However Netflix’s disappointing quarter comes as the company faces looming competition in the streaming market it pioneered. Disney, Apple, AT&T and Comcast’s NBCUniversal are preparing to unveil rival services in the coming months.

As the streaming battle heats up, some fan favourites will be pulled from Netflix as media companies claw their content away from the service. NBCUniversal last month announced it had taken the rights back for The Office, starting in 2021, while WarnerMedia is pulling Friends from Netflix next year. 
Netflix on Wednesday brushed off the threat, instead arguing that the losses of these shows would “free up budget for more original content”. 
It reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 60 cents a share, on revenue of $4.9bn. Analysts were looking for 56 cents a share on sales of $4.9bn. 
The company uses debt to help finance its heavy spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $12.6bn at the end of June, up from $10.3bn in March. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that. “In the meantime, our plan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments,” the company said.

Despite an underwhelming reaction from investors to its latest quarterly results, the streaming giant’s stock is up nearly 30 per cent so far this month, continuing its powerful recovery from the December sell-off’s nadir.
That helps keep Netflix on course for one of its best starts to the year on record. But in contrast to other big Januaries, the share price gains have been front-loaded, as a broad market rebound lifts other stocks and indices from their recent lows.
Netflix released a strong slate of holiday programming during the December quarter. That included Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller that prompted many viewers to mimic the main characters and attempt day-to-day tasks blindfolded, sometimes with predictably harmful results. Still, results showed new subscriber additions and revenue fell short of market forecasts, with investors marking the shares down 2.3 per cent on Friday to $345.35.
Among the so-called Faang stocks, Netflix has had the most powerful recovery since the lows that most of the quintet struck on December 24. It is up nearly 50 per cent over that period, but had also suffered the biggest drop among the group from its record high last year, falling 44.2 per cent to $233.88 on Christmas Eve from $418.97 on July 9.
Netflix is down 17.2 per cent from its record high, lagging Alphabet and Amazon on this measure.
Up 29.2 per cent so far this month, the stock’s performance this January still lags that of even last year, when it rose 40.8 per cent, and has plenty of work to do to take out 2013’s 78.5 per cent leap.
So far this month, the S&P 500 is up 6.5 per cent, with biotechs Nektar Therapeutics, Celgene (which are both no strangers to big share price moves) and oil company Hess the only three companies to have outpaced Netflix.

The Austrian privacy campaign group None of Your Business asked the country’s data regulator to investigate the firms for violating GDPR, the data regulation that came into force last May. 
The group said the companies failed to provide basic information, such as how they buy and sell user data, when contacted by 10 private citizens with requests for their personal information. 
“When tested, none of these systems provided the user with all relevant data. In most cases, users only got the raw data, but, for example, no information about who this data were shared with. This leads to structural violations of users’ rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information,” said Max Schrems, co-founder and director of NOYB, who has already beaten Facebook in a major privacy case and filed complaints against the company across Europe.
GDPR grants users the right to be informed about where and how their data are transacted, and how long it is stored for. This “right to access” is enshrined in Article 15, with violations theoretically leading to fines of up to €20m or 4 per cent of the companies’ worldwide turnover. 
To investigate whether large firms were indeed complying with GDPR, the group worked with 10 volunteers in Vienna who requested their own data from eight companies — Netflix, YouTube, Apple, Amazon, Spotify, SoundCloud, Flimmit and DAZN. “The results confirmed they were all evading their obligation to provide data or providing insufficient or inaccurate responses,” said Ioannis Kouvakas, a NOYB data protection lawyer who drafted the complaints. 
Recommended
Of the eight services that were queried, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Amazon had automated systems that allowed users to download their data immediately. 
Apple provided users roughly “40 Excel spreadsheets filled with alphanumeric data that made absolutely no sense,” said Mr Kouvakas. “More than 80 per cent of the data from Apple was in an incomprehensible form.” 
Similarly Google-owned YouTube also provided files that were mostly gibberish to the average person, including in esoteric file formats like JSON, he said. 
Netflix provided a list of raw data including descriptions of all series watched, details of when and where they were watched and which devices they were watched on. 
But they did not disclose what third parties they shared or procured data from. Mr Kouvakas added the company had also retained certain data such as a user’s IP address, a proxy for their exact location, for more than five years. “They have to delete the data as long as they’re no longer necessary for processing, and they have to provide justification for retaining each data type,” Mr Kouvakas said. “They did not.”
Tech groups have been preparing for a rush of similar claims under GDPR. In November, Privacy International, a campaign group, filed a series of complaints to the British, Irish and French data regulators against data brokers and advertising technology companies asking why they gather certain information and share it with third parties.
The case for users’ right to their own data has been fought publicly by Apple chief executive Tim Cook, who wrote in an essay this week: “[W]e believe the Federal Trade Commission should establish a data-broker clearinghouse, requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and giving users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all.”
Recommended
Mr Kouvakas said this was ironic. “Making declarations about how you respect user privacy is important but in order for it not to be a marketing statement, it has to be borne out in practice,” he said. “If the data they provide is incomprehensible to users, it doesn’t allow users to exercise their rights properly.”
A YouTube spokesperson said: “YouTube and Google provide industry leading tools to give users meaningful data transparency and control.” They added that they inform users of retention practices/time periods in Google’s privacy policy. 
“Privacy and data protection are core to Netflix, and we comply with the GDPR. We have not yet formally received the complaint,” Netflix said.
“Spotify takes data privacy and our obligations to users extremely seriously. We are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant,” a spokesperson said.
Apple and Amazon declined to comment. The Austrian Data regulator did not respond to a request for comment.

Shares in the online video company jumped more than 8 per cent at the open as investors cheered Netflix’s blowout earnings and subscriber gains, which have helped allay concerns over slowing momentum that have dogged the stock in recent months. 
The company behind hit shows such as House of Cards, Lost in Space and Orange is the New Black added nearly 7m net new subscribers in the third quarter — exceeding the 5.3m Wall Street analysts were expecting and the 5m its executives had predicted three months ago.
Netflix also said it was expecting to add 1.5m and 6.1m domestic and international paid subscribers, compared to previous guidance of 1.35m and 5.2m.
The figures should go some ways to reassuring investors who fear Netflix might repeat a shock miss in subscriber additions in its second-quarter report in July, which sent its stock plunging. 
“Upside in both third-quarter results and the fourth-quarter guide essentially . . . confirms our view that second-quarter softness did not reflect any fundamental change in the business,” said Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan.

William Power at Baird added that international growth was especially encouraging. “The standout was the strong fourth-quarter international guidance,” he said. “International growth remains broad-based, with the company calling out Asia as a growing contributor.”
Despite Wednesday’s gains, the stock remains down 11 per cent from its June high of $423.20. 
Shares are nonetheless up 93 per cent for the year, underscoring the scale of Netflix’s stunning rally, which in May briefly propelled the company’s market capitalisation above of that of Walt Disney to make it the most valuable media group in the US.
Not everyone was blown away by Netflix’s latest results, however. Analysts at Keybanc downgraded their rating on the stock to “sector weight” from “overweight”, arguing that they see limited upside to the shares.
“While we remain positive on Netflix’s opportunity to grow subscribers and revenue, we believe revenue growth and accelerating margin expansion are needed to drive substantial upside from here,” they wrote. “The latter has not developed at a pace that exceeds our expectations, which suggests upside is more limited.”
Cash burn could also be another headwind given the company’s frantic pace of spending on original content such as the series Maniac, which starts Hollywood A-lister Emma Stone and comic actor Jonah Hill. 
Netflix forecast a free cash burn of $3bn this year and another $3bn in 2019 but expects an improvement after that. 
Long term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from the $6.5bn reported at the end of 2017. The amount spent on interest payments meanwhile totalled $291.6m for the first nine months of the year, compared to $238m for the whole of 2017.

The video streaming company added nearly 7m net new subscribers in the third quarter — exceeding the 5.3m Wall Street analysts were expecting and the 5m its executives had predicted three months ago. It now counts more than 137m subscribers globally.
Shares jumped as much as 16 per cent in after-hours trading in New York. The rise eased in pre-market action on Wednesday, with the stock up 12 per cent ahead of the Wall Street open.
The results eased worries Netflix might repeat an unusual miss in subscriber additions in its second-quarter report in July, which had then sent its stock plunging.
Overall, this was a strong quarter for the company. Normal service has been restored
The July report brought a sudden end to a rally that had seen Netflix shares more than double between early January and mid-July. The pressure has only been amplified by the recent sell-off among other previously high-flying technology stocks.
Investors and analysts keep a close eye on Netflix’s ability to attract new subscribers as it pours money into new films and television shows.
The company plans to spend $8bn on content this year and has justified its investments as vital to gaining and retaining viewers amid increasing competition from the likes of Walt Disney, Amazon and AT&T.
The company relies on debt to finance its ballooning levels of content spending. It said it now anticipates free cash outflows of about $3bn in 2018, down from an earlier forecast of $4bn.
In the third quarter, Netflix reported robust subscriber growth both in its home country and in international markets where it has made a big push in recent years. It added 1.1m subscribers in the US and 5.9m in other countries, ahead of its own forecast of 650,000 and 4.35m, respectively.
“Overall, this was a strong quarter for the company. Normal service has been restored,” said Paolo Pescatore, a telecoms and media analyst. “More importantly, strong growth in its overseas market is encouraging.”
Reflecting the scrutiny given to Netflix’s subscriber growth, the company said it would focus on a metric it can forecast more accurately: net growth in paid subscribers. This excludes people who use free trial memberships to its service.
Starting in January, Netflix will only issue guidance for paid memberships, Reed Hastings, chief executive, wrote in his letter to shareholders, saying they were “a more reliable indicator of revenue growth”.
Third-quarter net income surged to $403m, or 89 cents a share, from $130m, or 29 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 34 per cent to $4bn. Analysts had estimated earnings of 68 cents a share and $4bn in revenue, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

During the quarter, new seasons of popular Netflix shows such as Orange is the New Black, Bojack Horseman and American Vandal were accompanied by new original franchises such as Maniac and Sacred Games, its first original series in India. The company also noted the success of original films including the romantic comedy To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.
Netflix gave bullish guidance for the current quarter, forecasting the addition of another 9.4m subscribers globally, ahead of analysts’ forecasts of 8.35m, according to FactSet.

Management pledged to protect dividends by slowing growth and concentrating on cash generation. 
● Mediclinic slumped to a record low after a first-half trading update from the hospital operator revealed continued problems in Switzerland due to regulatory changes and disappointing in-patient admissions. Management cut its margin target for the Swiss business as well as paring revenue growth guidance to reflect fewer basic-tariff patients in the United Arab Emirates. 
“Mediclinic is operating in a tough environment where regulation and outmigration, and the pace at which change is occurring, is having a significant impact on the business. We understand it is difficult for the company to predict the endgame here, as it is evolving fast, but we expect the miss on guidance and lack of visibility will be taken negatively by the market.”
● Flybe hit a record low on a profit warning, with the regional airline blaming higher costs combined with a deterioration of domestic and near-continent demand in recent weeks.
● US airline stocks climbed after United Continental raised earnings guidance. United said with third-quarter results that it would deliver full-year earnings per share of $8.00 to $8.75, compared with a previous low-end target of $7.25.
“United’s forward outlook is likely to satiate even the most demanding of bulls, in our view, with an implied earnings range of which the low end surpasses all current estimates. As was the case in July, we’re struggling to find things to complain about, despite our most cantankerous efforts. With many investors having questioned whether United’s sector-trouncing equity outperformance might stall into year-end, we believe these results strongly suggest the contrary.”
● Netflix jumped after its quarterly results showed both its US and International divisions outperforming market expectations. Management also raised guidance for fourth-quarter net subscriber growth and said its annual cash burn would be at the lower end of the $3bn to $4bn target range, with 2019 likely to be similar. 
Buckingham Research remained cautious. A current share price of about $386 implies that Netflix will have 460m global members by 2025, compared with 146.5m at the end of the third quarter, it said. But more than three-quarters of the growth needs to come from markets other than the US and western Europe, which may be a challenge, argued Buckingham Research. The broker picked out the Indian market as likely to “remain competitively intense and difficult to fully monetise”.
● HSBC upgraded Go-Ahead to “buy” and cut Stagecoach to “hold”.
A recovery for Stagecoach’s provincial bus operations has been cancelled out by problems in London and the US, which will keep a lid on earnings, said HSBC. While Stagecoach may look good value at just over 8 times current year earnings, the stock still trades at a premium to peers based on its enterprise valuation in spite of its lack of an obvious route to growth outside rail, the broker said.
On Go-Ahead, HSBC said London bus earnings look protected from spending cuts given the transport group has already retendered a large number of its contracts. It also noted that the award of the strategically important franchise to run the South Eastern rail service has been pushed back to early next year, so some significant time would have elapsed since the summer fiasco at Go-Ahead’s Govia Thameslink Railway. The Go-Ahead share price is underpinned by cash flow from bus operations with rail and international expansion providing option value, said HSBC, which set a £19.70 target.
● Liberum started coverage of Sophos, the security software maker, with a “buy” stance and 530p target. It said the stock’s valuation of 38 times current-year earnings looked cheap versus a peer group at 41 times.
“Sophos’ shares have been battered year to date on the back of both perceived competitive pressures and a disappointing first-quarter billings growth rate. However, the company has a leading cloud platform which combined with top-performing products can drive cross-selling into existing and new customers. We expect billings to return to fast growth in the second half, and the midterm guidance of circa $1bn in billings remains deliverable”
● HSBC cut its target price on Inchcape, the car dealership operator, to 650p from 860p and repeated “hold” advice. It cited sharply lower new-car sales in the UK and Australia as well as a strengthening of the yen against the Australian dollar, which the broker said would increase Subaru import costs. 
● Deutsche Bank started coverage of Fevertree Drinks, the tonic water maker, with a “hold” rating and £30 target. Slowing growth over the medium term makes Fevertree’s valuation look “a bit stretched” at 50 times current-year earnings, a 150 per cent premium to the European consumer staples sector, it said.
● In brief: ConvaTec cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Essentra raised to “buy” at Jefferies; KPN upgraded to “overweight” at Barclays; Logitech upgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Michelin downgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Safran downgraded to “underperform” at Jefferies; Telekom Austria raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

Shares in the video streaming company rallied 4 per cent on Wednesday, buoyed by better than expected subscriber data in its latest financial quarter. The rise extended a run that has lifted its stock more than 90 per cent since the start of 2018.
Despite the rise in Netflix shares, the New York Stock Exchange’s Fang+ index remained lodged in negative territory on Wednesday, down 0.31 per cent from Tuesday’s close.
The benchmark, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google-parent Alphabet and other popular tech names, is down almost 15 per cent from its all-time high struck in June. 
That stumble has been closely watched by Wall Street and global investors, as investing in Faang stocks has been one of the most lucrative and popular trades in recent years. 
For the year to date, the Fang index is 17.8 per cent higher, and the trade has been responsible for driving much of the wider 2018 rally in US stock markets. 
“The concentration of performance in the Faangs over the last three years causes numerous investors to be concerned and rightly so,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations. 
“We need to see more depth and breadth of performance to the market to instil more confidence. That is why today, you aren’t seeing more buyers.”
As investors have increased their exposure to the stocks, there is a rising awareness that a concentration of capital in a select few companies has raised the risk that a fall in their prices could magnify losses across the market should turbulence persist. 
Fund managers surveyed by Bank of America ranked the long-Faang position, combined with a long position in the Chinese equivalent BAT trade, which includes Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as the most crowded for the ninth consecutive month.
Combined with a record proportion of investors believing the global economy is in the late stage of the economic cycle, increasing the likelihood that any dip will become a concerted downturn, the exposure to tech stocks threatens to ripple through other sectors should investors rush to sell.
The upcoming earnings season is seen as an important test for other big tech names and for Wall Street more broadly. 
“Netflix is important short term, but as soon as the next tech bellwether company reports, it will be forgotten,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. “It is a sort of ‘what have you done for me lately’ mindset.”

The company, whose shares had more than doubled in the year to date, opened 13 per cent lower on Tuesday, initially wiping as much as $20bn off its valuation, before recovering some ground. 
Netflix’s stunning rally came to a halt after it missed its own subscriber forecasts on Monday afternoon. The early stock drop was Netflix’s biggest since its last serious disappointment on subscriber numbers in July 2016.
Netflix’s market capitalisation fell below $150bn at the opening of trading, compared with Disney’s $166bn, before bouncing back above its rival. Netflix’s valuation surpassed that of the home of Mickey Mouse, Star Wars and Marvel’s Avengers in May. Disney is preparing to launch its own Netflix rival next year. 
Netflix reported worse than expected subscriber growth for both its international and domestic markets in the second quarter and cut its estimates for third-quarter growth, despite ramping up spending on marketing over the past year. 
Reed Hastings, chief executive, insisted in an analyst Q&A session on Monday afternoon that the company’s “fundamentals have never been stronger”, with viewing setting new records. Executives blamed their own forecasting errors for the subscriber shortfall, which was not concentrated in any one part of the world. 
In a note on Tuesday, analysts at UBS warned investors that “bingeing Netflix requires digestion”. The shortfall marked a “clear break from recent business model momentum”, after four straight quarters of exceeding its forecasts, UBS said. 
William Power, analyst at Baird, noted that Netflix had quickly returned to form after its last significant subscriber shortfall two years ago. “Overall, we suspect the miss is more of a blip than a significant change to the broader growth opportunity,” he said, sympathising with the company’s “forecasting challenges . . . given the many moving pieces in 100-plus countries”. 
John Janedis of Jefferies added that “while there was no single source of the weaker results”, neither was there a “breakout hit during the quarter”, despite debuts of new seasons of Marvel superhero series Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, and controversial teen drama 13 Reasons Why. 
Some analysts questioned why a near-doubling of Netflix’s marketing spend in the first half of the year had not yielded better results, while the company’s ability to raise prices might be curtailed given increasing competition from Disney and HBO, now part of AT&T. “It is what it is,” Mr Hastings said of the new competition, adding that Netflix would focus on improving its content, user interface and marketing. 
Other observers suggested Netflix would have to raise prices to offset the slower growth. 
“The real question is how long investors will be willing to be patient with Netflix’s losses in original content spending, especially in light of the growing competitive environment,” said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies. “It helps when investors believe the company has little to no real competition. Perhaps that was a belief of Netflix a few years ago, but I don’t think that is a safe assumption any longer.”

B Riley FBR analysts said that with Netflix trading at nearly 140 times 2018 earnings, the risk of a commissioning misfire was significant enough to avoid the stock. “Other content creators have dry spells. Netflix has not seen that yet. It is possible that after huge successes that Netflix’s ability to create hit new shows may be settling into a robust plateau,” the team said. “Netflix would argue that this could influence quarterly results, but that its full-year growth will be driven by the deep library. That assertion has yet to be tested, because Netflix has not yet had a sustained dry spell for impactful new content. If that happens, we suspect that subs growth would be impacted.”
Royal Mail led the FTSE 100 gainers after a first-quarter trading update from the group came in slightly ahead of expectations, with growth for its pan-European parcels business offsetting a revenue decline in the UK. Management also reiterated full-year guidance for UK letter volumes and margins. 
TalkTalk rallied after the broadband provider left full-year guidance unchanged, in spite of delivering mixed first-quarter results. Net customer additions were better than analysts expected, with TalkTalk adding 80,000 accounts in the period, though the increase was via wholesale rather than its own brand after an unidentified company migrated its customer base from a rival provider.
WPP and Publicis retreated after US peer Omnicom’s quarterly update showed weaker growth than expected. Deteriorating demand in the UK and US meant Omnicom’s organic sales slowed from 2.4 per cent in the first quarter to 2.0 per cent in the second, which missed a consensus forecast of 2.7 per cent growth.
Publicis is due to deliver second-quarter figures this week, while WPP’s next scheduled report is in early September.
Schibsted was the Stoxx 600’s biggest gainer after interim results from the Oslo-based newspaper publisher showed improving trends for its online classified ads business in Norway, Sweden and Spain. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation beat consensus forecasts by 7 per cent on in-line revenue, thanks to reduced investment costs, which “confirms improving operational gearing”, said JPMorgan Cazenove, which called Schibsted “the best play in online classifieds”. 
● Goldman Sachs upgraded Asos to “buy” from “neutral” with a £79 target. Accelerating momentum in the US and EU from next year will deliver 24 per cent sales growth in the financial year ending 2020, putting Asos on a path to increase sales from £1.9bn last year to about £7bn by 2024.
Historically, Asos has generated £7 of incremental revenue for every £1 of capital expenditure, said Goldman. It also forecast that falling warehouse and distribution costs would help offset headwinds including US import duty and an increasing reliance on third-party brands, which would squeeze gross margin to 49.9 per cent by 2021. “We also view beauty as an incremental opportunity. Amid tough competition, we expect Asos to continue to differentiate versus incumbent and newer players,” said the broker.
● Citigroup upgraded Stagecoach to “neutral” from “sell” after its dividend cut last month, which followed the transport group being ordered by government to hand back the East Coast rail franchise.
“Although we see some further risks remaining, the worst now appears to be behind,” said Citi. Its 281p-a-share sum-of-the-parts valuation included just 6p for Stagecoach’s rail operations, against 242p for the UK regional bus division. “While the company is shortlisted to bid on three rail franchises, we think the recent East Coast situation makes a new franchise win unlikely in the short term,” it said.
● Berenberg repeated “sell” advice on Greene King in a note calling the pub operator “a value trap”.
Underlying trading looks poor, with Greene King delivering just 2.2 per cent like-for-like sales growth in the first eight weeks of its 2019 fiscal year in spite of warm weather and the World Cup,” said Berenberg. “Even in one of the best periods for the pub trade in recent history, Greene King did not achieve adequate like-for-like growth to offset cost increases and increase earnings,” it added.
The broker also criticised last year’s refinancing of high interest-rate bonds tied to its Spirit acquisition, saying management had been “disingenuous with shareholders”. Highlighting that the deal had an exceptional cash charge of nearly £50m attached, Berenberg said: “Management refused to tell us the interest rate on its new £350m revolving credit facility used to fund the refinancing. However, we would have to assume it is less than 2.5 per cent for the refinancing to have created any value. Given even the company’s cheapest secured debt costs circa 4 per cent, we consider it more likely that it has destroyed £25m to £30m of value.”
Greene King’s real motivations for refinancing debt may have been to make dividend cover look more sustainable and to remove debt securitisation on more pubs, allowing them to be sold, said Berenberg. “We think both of those are indicative of the challenging financial position Greene King is in now. With underlying trading still poor and leverage at 4.2 times net debt to ebitda, we struggle to see sense in the business continuing to pay £103m of dividends per annum when it will only generate free cash flow of £50m to £60m.”
● Investec downgraded Paddy Power Betfair to “sell” from “buy”, with an £80.10 target. Its downgrade follows the US Supreme Court in May freeing individual states to allow sports betting by ruling that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, was unconstitutional.
“While Paddy Power Betfair has significant first-mover advantage in the US, we caution that, especially post the recent re-rating, it is very much a long-term value-driven strategy,” said Investec. “UK gaming stocks, especially Paddy Power Betfair, saw a significant re-rating in relation to the US repeal of PASPA (arguably up to 27 per cent), and we question whether gambling stocks will continue to tick up on further positive US news (as US state regulation is announced) or drift down as investors realise fundamental value is opaque, skewed to US-listed incumbents (licence issuers), and longer term in nature.”
Valuing the bookmaker’s US operations at 850p a share, or 50 per cent of the full value to reflect regulatory risks, Investec said the shares look too expensive against key peers GVC and William Hill.
● In brief: Morgan Advanced Materials raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Amino Technologies rated new “buy” at Liberum; Proximus upgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Michelin upgraded to “buy” at HSBC; Brunello Cucinelli cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Assa Abloy downgraded to “reduce” at HSBC; SBM Offshore cut to “market perform” at Bernstein; Siemens Gamesa and Vestas Wind Systems rated new “buy” at UBS.

1998,https://www.ft.com/content/e76910eb-a786-3437-850d-c492cca44aa5,Alexandra Scaggs,The Netflix dilemma -- updated,2018-07-17,12:10:47,"Netflix, the ever-churning content flywheel, reported subscriber growth of 5.2m in the second quarter, below its own forecasts of 6.2m. 
This led to a slide of more than 10 per cent in its share price: 
Its bonds fared a bit better, but still fell:
This backs up the idea that platforms get their equity value from user numbers, not profits or revenues. Indeed, Netflix's second-quarter user growth was 16 per cent lower than expected, and shares fell nearly 15 per cent in after-hours trading, almost in line with the user shortfall. 
And because Netflix needs to grow its user numbers to improve its valuation, it faces the same dilemma as any content platform: a trade-off between the quality of its content and the quantity of its users.
This tradeoff is glossed over in a recent series of posts about the company on REDEF, an aggregation site of “interest remixes”. The latest argues that “ Netflix isn't being reckless, it's just playing a game no one else dares”. The name of that game is monopoly, according to author Matthew Ball, former head of strategy at Amazon Studios: 
In short, he says the streaming company wants to replace television altogether: “The company doesn’t want to be a leader in video, or even the leader in video – it wants to monopolize the consumption of video; to become TV.”
Succeeding in that goal requires providing content for everyone, from the career television snob to the medical assistant seeking to unwind after a long day of work. If Netflix is indeed set on developing and producing most of its own content, it is not clear it can succeed in reaching all of those markets at once.
The issue is quality. While programming in the US has gone through a bit of a renaissance, and high-quality shows do seem to find more commercial success now, let's level here: most of those quality shows are not developed by Netflix. 
While we will not begrudge anyone their go-to costume drama or ultraviolent science fiction, the best television shows in recent years have been financed and developed by networks on the fringes of popular programming: Atlanta on FX, Counterpart on Starz, and Mr Robot on -- however improbably -- USA. 
It is interesting that Ball is a former Amazon employee, because all of these shows can be found on Amazon's video-streaming platform, and none of them are carried by Netflix.
Even Babylon Berlin, Netflix's ambitious period drama about Weimar Germany, was not developed or produced by the streaming platform, but by a collection of European production companies and Sky, the UK television network.
That backs up the argument that Netflix cannot be all things to all people, especially because it develops and produces most of its programming in-house. If it needs to hit a viewership home run with each of its original programs, it cannot afford to take a risk on “ Twin Peaks with rappers” -- instead it will go with the safer bet, which is more Twin Peaks. 
It can be argued that the rise of prestige television would not have happened without the internet's fragmentation of consumption. Such programming is by its nature challenging and not widely accessible, and requires consumers who have enough insulation from the daily stressors of life that they can afford to spend their leisure time thinking about its existential tensions. 
Lest we forget, even today, the most popular show in the US is 'The Big Bang Theory,' which has a plotline banal enough to “ turn [one] off from the ^%$*&$^ situation comedies altogether.”
HBO understands this. Amazon understands this. Netflix might understand this -- but if it does, it seems to want to become the new CBS, not the new HBO. And if it cannot develop both mass-market hits and more artful fare, it will not be able to replace television entirely. (Not without buying more content from networks, at least.)
In fact, a note published by UBS last week argues that it is not slowing subscriber growth that is the problem, but declining engagement: 
UBS downgraded the shares to neutral and cut their price target to $375 from $425 raised their price target to $425 before the results. From the note: 
They have since cut their price target to $360, calling the earnings report a “clear break from recent business model momentum”. 
It may be the case that Netflix has decided to re-focus on movies, as it says it has original films with Martin Scorsese and Michael Bay in the works. But movies require a bigger initial time commitment from the viewer, and they are not bingeable in the same way as, say, a sci-fi spy drama that doubles as a Cold War allegory and a deeper interrogation of human nature. 
The winner may in fact receive the spoils, as Ball argues -- but without better content, it is not clear the winner will be Netflix.

All feedback is welcome, particularly of the constructive variety, as we try to get this right. (Email to authersnote@ft.com). Premium subscribers can click here to receive it every day by email.
Welcome back from New York, where the most significant event of the market day may have happened immediately after the market closed. The after-hours market did not like Netflix's results one little bit, as is shown by this chart, which uses Bloomberg data:
That 13 per cent fall after-hours may yet be seen as a turning point. Of all the Fang stocks (originally for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), Netflix has always looked the most uncomfortably similar to the dotcom stocks from 1999. It is burning a lot of cash and relying on junk-rated debt to keep going, with a business model that seems easy to copy. 
We, of course, know that the Fangs have led the market for most of the time since the presidential election in November 2016:
Perhaps less appreciated is the way Netflix has taken the lead among the Fangs this year:
Nothing about Netflix's results pleased investors, even though the headline earnings per share were 7 per cent ahead of consensus estimates. The problem is that its growth is unsustainable, and that the company admits it faces stiff competition.
The Fangs have wobbled on the edge of a correction before, notably during Facebook's data privacy scandal earlier this year. The reception for Netflix now ups the ante for the rest of the Fangs considerably.
For the next two days, the market will be dominated by Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell's testimony before Congress. Let me try to mark your card very briefly.
First, the market is now plainly positioned for more rate rises, with two more this year regarded as a certainty, and three as a likelihood:
If Jay Powell wanted to convince the market that he meant business, then he has succeeded. The reason he might well mean business is that the US economy, if not that of the rest of the world, shows real signs of overheating. 
The latest evidence for this came with today's retail sales numbers, which confirmed a historic shift towards online retailing, but also showed overall sales increasing at a rate not seen since the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession:
The big question is the yield curve. A flattening yield curve on its face represents a belief in a hawkish Fed error, so that rates will rise in the near future, but not much thereafter. And the yield curve indeed continues to flatten:
Why is the yield curve flattening? It may well be to do with foreign sanctuary flows, as investors worried by slowing Chinese growth and an incipient trade war seek a haven in long treasuries. But Mr Powell will have to offer his own explanation.

Facebook shares climbed as much as 1 per cent to an all-time high of $209.34 while Google-parent Alphabet rose as much as 1.9 per cent to $1,218.76 per cent. 
Amazon, the third of the original quartet, rose as much as 1.6 per cent to $185.69, leaving shares up 58 per cent so far this year. The advance in shares of Jeff Bezos’ ecommerce juggernaut came despite the embarrassing technical glitch the US website suffered at its 36-hour global discount event dubbed ‘Prime Day’ on Monday and strikes by its workers in Germany on Tuesday. 
Netflix was the main outlier falling as much as 14.1 per cent — after saying its quarterly net new subscribers fell 1m shy of analysts estimates before — clawing back those losses to trade about 6 per cent lower. 
Despite the sell-off in the streaming site the Nasdaq Composite scaled new highs rising 0.7 per cent to 7,863.06. The broader NYSE Fang+Index that includes Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Twitter, Baidu and Alibaba however failed to match that feat but was up 0.8 per cent on the day.

The S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent within the first hour of trade, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.1 per cent.
Technology was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500, up 1.7 per cent. Netflix, up 7.2 per cent, did a lot of the heavy lifting, after delivering a solid quarterly result after the closing bell on Monday.
The benchmark’s next-best sectors were consumer cyclicals, up 1 per cent, and industrials, up 0.9 per cent. Telecommunications, down 0.25 per cent, consumer staples, down 0.1 per cent, and energy, which was flat, were the worst performers.
Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson, the two major companies that reported forecast-beating first-quarter earnings this morning, had given up pre-market gains and were down 0.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively.
Tesla, which late on Monday denied its most recent shutdown of its Model 3 production line was related to safety issues, was down 1 per cent.
US Treasuries were a touch weaker, with yields (which move in the opposite direction to bond prices) slightly higher. 
The dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s performance against a weighted basket of global currencies, was up 0.2 per cent to 89.61, bouncing off yesterday’s close, which was its lowest this month.

Netflix closed up 9.2 per cent to a record high of $336.06 after delivering a forecast-busting set of results after the closing bell on Monday. It was the stock’s second-biggest one-day jump in 2018, and also its 10th-biggest of the past five years.
That helped push up the NYSE Fang index, which tracks some of the market’s most popular tech stocks, up 3.7 per cent. It was the gauge’s biggest advance since late August 2015 in sessions that were also powered by gains for Netflix.
The S&P 500 closed 1.1 per cent higher, with the technology sector the best performer with a 2.3 per cent gain. Next best were consumer cyclicals, up 1.6 per cent, and basic materials, up 1.1 per cent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9 per cent and flicked into positive territory for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.7 per cent.
Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson both reported forecast-beating first-quarter results on Tuesday morning, but closed 1.6 per cent and 0.9 per cent lower, respectively. 
Southwest Airlines finished 1.1 per cent lower. A federal regulator said Tuesday that one person died after an engine failed on a Southwest flight and forced it to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia.
Despite the gains for shares, longer-dated US Treasuries still managed to advance. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction to price, on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was down 0.9 basis points to 2.823 per cent, although the more policy-sensitive two-year Treasury was up 1.3 bps to 2.3898 per cent.

The milestone comes as Reed Hastings, chief executive, suggested on Monday that Netflix’s business model meant it was “substantially inoculated” from the legal and regulatory battles that tech companies are increasingly facing around the world over issues such as data privacy.
“I’m very glad that we built the business not to be ad-supported [and] to be subscription,” Mr Hastings, who sits on Facebook’s board, said in an analyst interview.
He also pointed to the $10bn that Netflix plans to spend over the next year in content and marketing, compared with $1.3bn on technology. 
“Objectively we are much more of a media company, in that way, than pure tech,” he said. “Of course, we want to be great at both but again, we are really pretty different from the pure tech companies.”
Even as stocks such as Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon have come under pressure in recent weeks amid rising legal risks, Netflix has surged. Shares jumped more than 7 per cent in early trading on Tuesday to hit an all-time high. 
For the first quarter, the digital entertainment group posted net additional subscribers of 7.4m, compared with about 5m that most analysts were expecting, to reach a total of 125m members. 
There are so many competitors especially around the world. If we get lazy or slow we’ll get run over just like anybody else
Revenues were up 40 per cent to $3.7bn in the three months to March, the fastest quarterly year-on-year increase it has posted since introducing its online streaming service. Net income rose 63 per cent to $290m. 
The jump came from a combination of last year’s price rise, driving a 14 per cent increase in average selling price, coupled with faster than expected subscriber growth. The quarter saw the debut of new series including a second season of Marvel’s Jessica Jones and the splashy sci-fi drama Altered Carbon. 
Its revenue outlook for the second quarter was just ahead of Wall Street’s previous estimates at $3.9bn, with 6.2m net additional subscribers. 
International streaming revenues will hit $1.94bn in the second quarter, Netflix said in its outlook, compared with $1.9bn for the US. 
The Silicon Valley-based company already has more members overseas — international subscribers overtook the US in the second quarter of 2017 — but customers typically pay more in its most developed markets.

A more global business also means a wider range of rivals, from traditional broadcasters to local streaming services. Netflix is producing original content in 17 different markets and expects an increasing number of those films and shows, such as the Brazilian sci-fi series 3%, to be viewed globally.
“There are so many competitors especially around the world,” Mr Hastings said. “If we get lazy or slow we’ll get run over just like anybody else.”
That would mean this year’s $8bn budget for TV shows and movies would continue to grow, he added. 
Observers lauded the company’s latest results, with analysts at Baird asking: “Can anything slow its subscriber momentum?” 
Baird forecasts Netflix will reach 300m global subscribers by 2025 but predicts that the company will not achieve free cash flow break-even until 2024, as it continues to invest heavily in content and marketing. Netflix’s cash outflows are expected to be as much as $4bn this year. 
Most analysts, however, are confident that investors will continue to stomach the losses so long as Netflix continues to increase membership. 
“Netflix’s programming win streak continues and it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors,” said Credit Suisse in a note. “Given the accelerated pace of subscriber additions, we believe the Street will continue to underwrite the investments.”
However, none of Netflix’s films will be up for an award at the Cannes Film Festival this year. The streaming service decided not to enter the awards because of a rule that, it said, means any film in competition at Cannes “cannot be watched on Netflix in France for the following three years”.
Ted Sarandos, Netflix content chief, denied that this would affect the company’s ability to attract talent or win bids for new films. 
Netflix gave 33 films a theatrical release last year at the same time as they appeared online, five of which were nominated for Academy Awards.
“It’s becoming more and more accepted as part of the distribution norm,” Mr Sarandos said. “Defining distribution by what room you see it in is not the business we want to be in.”

Shares were up 10.5 per cent in morning trade in New York on Tuesday, and had gained as much 13.2 per cent earlier in the session. It was the second-best performer in the benchmark S&P 500, behind a 17.7 per cent gain for ResMed.
That brought Netflix’s gain in 2018 to 30.9 per cent, making it the top stock in the S&P 500, and nearly five times the gain for the benchmark. At Monday’s close, before the release of its December quarter results, the stock was the index’s 10th-best performer.
Today’s share price jump pushed Netflix’s market capitalisation through $100bn for the first time, putting it ahead of the likes of Nike and Goldman Sachs, and just behind oilfield services company Schlumberger.
Last year, Netflix shares gained 56.4 per cent, while the S&P 500 rose 19.4 per cent.

2031,https://www.ft.com/content/c97f0352-ffeb-11e7-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5,Tim Bradshaw,Netflix races to bolster content as former partners become rivals,2018-01-23,05:33:49,"When the first season of House of Cards made its debut on Netflix in February 2013, pundits wondered whether the video streaming service could really afford the $100m political drama. At the time, Netflix had 33.3m streaming subscribers, many of whom quickly became glued to the tale of Washington DC scheming and intrigue. 
Five years ago, original commissioning was a novelty for what was only a few years earlier known primarily as a DVD-by-mail business. Then, Netflix was heavily dependent on content distribution deals with traditional media groups including Walt Disney and Mad Men-maker AMC for the vast majority of its online library. 
Fast-forward to early 2018 and Netflix can afford to write off $39m without Wall Street even blinking. The $39m non-cash charge incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 was related to programming, including two episodes of House of Cards that Netflix commissioned but will never air due to the sexual harassment scandal that erupted around the show’s leading man, Kevin Spacey. 
That charge was reported alongside another forecast-busting set of results released on Monday that sent Netflix’s market capitalisation soaring above $100bn for the first time, sending shares up more than 10 per cent on Tuesday morning. 
Annual revenues jumped 32 per cent year-on-year to $11.7bn in 2017, while net income tripled to $559m, thanks to hit shows including Stranger Things, The Crown and 13 Reasons Why. 
“Given the big beat on subscribers in the quarter — especially for the domestic business, it is hard to argue with Netflix’s statement that they ‘had a beautiful quarter’,” said analysts MoffettNathanson. 
Tuesday morning also gave Netflix a preview of its most promising Academy Awards yet, as its movie Mudbound received four nominations — its first for a feature film. Other titles brought its nomination total to eight, up from just three last year. 
Yet as investors cheered Netflix’s accelerating growth to reach 117.6m subscribers globally, the company warned that maintaining its momentum in original content would come at an upfront cost that makes that initial $100m outlay look like a rounding error. 
Netflix’s liabilities from content pre-payment and debt have increased fourfold in the last five years. The combination of its long-term debt and streaming content obligations has swelled from $6.1bn at the end of 2012, when House of Cards was first commissioned, to $24.2bn at the end of last year. 
Of that total, $17.7bn is streaming content obligations — what it pays for the acquisition, licensing and production of television shows and movies, sometimes years in advance of broadcasting a show. The other $6.5bn is debt — and Netflix said on Monday that it planned to tap the bond markets again soon. 
Analysts at Jefferies said in a note to clients that expenses such as marketing spending and programming cost were “higher relative to our expectations”. 
To justify that $24bn of liabilities, chief executive Reed Hastings is asking investors to bet on Netflix’s success in producing hit shows as it races to fill the programming gap left by the likes of Disney turning from partner to competitor in the streaming market. 
“We’ve had that track record in the last couple of years at greater and greater scale,” Mr Hastings said in Monday’s quarterly analyst interview, which the company streamed on YouTube. “We are continuing to take it up a notch.” 
Many analysts agreed, with researchers at Bernstein saying that the results confirmed Netflix’s “flywheel is working brilliantly”, as more content drives more subscribers which fuels further programming investment. 
“Content and marketing investment is working better than anticipated — so the indicated action is: press the gas pedal,” Bernstein’s Todd Juenger wrote in a note on Tuesday. “Spending more, faster is ironically the less risky path, since the most important key to long-term success is extending the scale advantage as wide and fast as possible.”
Netflix executives touted the upcoming launches of Altered Carbon, a science-fiction show, and Everything Sucks, a coming-of-age comedy-drama set in 1990s Oregon, as examples of shows that would continue to attract new subscribers in 2018. 
The company also plans to commission more programming in languages other than English, from just a handful of shows last year such as Germany’s Dark to more than 30 international “originals” in 2018, from producers in Poland, South Korea and Japan. Alongside that are dozens more full-length movies, after the Will Smith blockbuster Bright proved a hit with viewers last month. 
In total, Netflix plans to invest as much as $8bn in new content this year — and Mr Hastings warned that the budget would continue to grow. 
“It will definitely of course be higher in 2019 and 2020,” he said of Netflix’s content costs. “Don’t think of $8bn as some new plateau.” 
Competition, too, is increasing. Disney is planning to launch new subscription streaming services starting later this year and Hulu, the US internet video service that is jointly owned by Disney, Fox and Comcast, grew to 17m subscribers last year. 
Anticipation of that competition from traditional media companies was what drove Netflix to invest in its own TV shows in the first place, according to content chief Ted Sarandos. 
“We have strategically and they have strategically been moving in this direction for a long time,” he said on Monday. “One of the reasons that we entered into original programming was that if we got to the place where networks didn’t want to sell us their content in second [distribution] windows that we would be replacing that by creating our own original programming. And it’s playing out in that direction.”
Mr Sarandos added that many Netflix shows that are licensed from or made by Disney, such as Marvel spin-offs Jessica Jones and The Punisher, are locked into long-term deals. “As long as they keep making those shows, they continue on Netflix,” he said.
If Mr Hastings was concerned about the impact of Disney’s $66bn plan to buy 21st Century Fox’s entertainment businesses, he did a good job of hiding it when he was quizzed by analysts about it for the first time on Monday. 
“These kind of big US media company mergers are pretty peripheral to us,” he said. “I was as surprised as anyone else that Fox was willing to sell”. 
Yet even though Rupert Murdoch has suggested that the competitive threat from Netflix contributed to his decision to sell Fox to Disney, Mr Hastings said he was looking forward to the new streaming services that would follow the deal — as a viewer, at least. 
“Disney, with its strength of brand and unique content, will have some real success,” the Netflix chief said. “I know I'll be a subscriber of it for my own personal watching.”

2041,https://www.ft.com/content/e9d7e4de-b2b6-11e7-a398-73d59db9e399,Tim Bradshaw,Netflix subscriber growth tops estimates,2017-10-17,00:02:17,"Netflix attracted more new subscribers than expected in the third quarter, driving its shares to a record high, despite flagging an uptick in its content investment costs to up to $8bn next year. 
The number of global subscribers rose by 5.3m to 109.3m, almost 1m more than Netflix and Wall Street analysts had forecast, for a 29 per cent increase in net additional subscribers so far this year. 
That growth is set to continue into the fourth quarter as Netflix predicted net additions of 6.3m subscribers, even after the price rises in several markets that it announced earlier this month. Netflix is targeting “slow and steady” price increases, which it hopes to justify by increasing its library of original content. 
“Price is all relative to value,” Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said on Monday. “We are continuing to increase the content offering and we are seeing that reflected in viewing around the world. We try to maintain that feeling that consumers have that we are great value in the amount of content that we have, relative to price.”
Revenues at the US-based streaming service rose 30 per cent year-on-year to $2.99bn, exceeding analysts’ forecasts, while net income jumped 150 per cent to $130m. Netflix’s shares rose as much as 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading before settling to be 1.5 per cent higher at $205.65 — a new record. Shares in the company this year have risen more than 60 per cent.
To fuel its growth, Netflix has been spending billions of dollars on original content, from TV shows such as The Crown and Stranger Things, as well as forthcoming Will Smith movie Bright and its first series in Italian and German, Suburra and Dark. 
Netflix said its content budget would range between $7bn-$8bn next year, up from $6bn this year and higher than its executives had forecast for 2018. It said it will release about 80 original movies next year, up from only eight in the last quarter.
However, Mr Hastings effectively ruled out buying The Weinstein Company, which is facing an uncertain future after allegations of serial sexual harassment by its co-founder Harvey Weinstein. “It would be extremely unlikely for us to be a bidder for the firm,” Mr Hastings said. 
Netflix has made $17bn worth of content commitments over the next “several years”, as it plans for the day when the library of older TV shows and movies that it licenses from traditional media companies dries up.
“While we have multiyear deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear,” Netflix said. “Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes.” 
That investment in content will contribute to free cash outflows of up to $2.5bn this year, in line with its previous guidance. Netflix said it expected to turn to the debt markets to finance those costs.
The Silicon Valley-based company noted that competition was heating up, after The Walt Disney Company announced plans to launch its own streaming services and Facebook recently launched a new Watch tab for original videos. Last week, Apple secured its first TV series commission with Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories. 
In its quarterly recorded conversation with an analyst posted to YouTube on Monday, Mr Hastings played down the affect of Disney content being pulled from Netflix. Disney shows and films are only available on Netflix in a handful of countries around the world, he said, which has not impeded global growth.
