{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: The global opportunity for streaming TV shows and movies becomes more compelling every year with the rise of smart TVs and faster broadband. With our streaming growth, Netflix is leading the development of Internet TV. Members enjoyed over 2 billion hours of Netflix streaming video in Q4, which is approximately 30 hours per member per month on average. Every quarter we are improving our content selection, we are improving our user experience, we are learning more about social, and we are increasing our brand awareness in the 47 countries where we offer our Internet TV network. 1    2  Domestic Streaming  Q4 Results  Domestically, we grew faster than expected in streaming members (up 220k to 21.67 million) in Q4.  October and November member trends were consistent with our expectations from our last earnings  call, while in December, we not only returned to strongly positive net streaming additions (aided by  strong seasonal gross adds) but exceeded our forecast.  In particular, we saw fewer streaming  cancellations, as well as lower migration to DVD-only plans, resulting in the outperformance for  streaming members.    The domestic streaming segment delivered $52 million of contribution profit, or 10.9% contribution  margin. We exceeded our domestic streaming contribution margin target of around 8% due to higher  than expected streaming members and revenue, as well as some under-spending in both content and  marketing.    Outlook   We are encouraged by the strength in acquisition that we are seeing, coupled with continued  improvements in retention among our domestic streaming members. For Q1 to date, our domestic net  additions for streaming are tracking close to our net additions in Q1 2010 of 1.7 million net additions.   Given this trend, we are comfortable with our ability to continue to expand our domestic streaming  contribution margin.   Since we significantly out-performed our 8% domestic streaming contribution margin target in Q4, we  are increasing our Q1 contribution margin target to approximately 11%. Then, consistent with our  previous guidance, we expect to increase the domestic streaming contribution margin throughout the  year to deliver a trend of margin expansion that averages 100 bps per quarter.  We will continue to  increase our content spending sequentially every quarter, but not at the year-over-year rate expected in  Q1 (more than doubling).    Domestic Content Library  As a result of the significant investments in our streaming library throughout 2011, our current domestic  offering is dramatically improved from a year ago. We have a material increase in the quantity and  quality of the content to show for our increased spending – most notably across on-air TV, kids TV and  library TV. While our 2012 domestic streaming content commitments are already substantially in place,  that doesn't mean our offering will be static in the coming months. The relationships we've established  with all major producers of film and TV in the U.S., including multiple output arrangements, ensure a  steady flow of new titles to the service.  The remaining Starz titles will come off our domestic service at the end of February.  Since the Sony  output came off in Q2 2011, the remaining Starz content is primarily the Encore catalog titles and the 15  current Disney Pay 1 titles.  For the Encore catalog titles, we have plenty of substitutes and in many      3  cases have already directly relicensed from the studios some of the top performing Encore titles. So, the  only significant loss is the current 15 Disney output titles, such as Toy Story 3 and Tangled, which  currently constitute about 2% of our domestic viewing.      Throughout 2012, Paramount will provide us (through our EPIX deal) with such successful family fare as  The Adventures of Tin Tin, Rango and Hugo, which, with 11 Oscar nominations including Best  Picture, is one of the most acclaimed movies of the year.  And in 2013, when our DreamWorks  Animation output deal comes online, we'll strengthen our long-term, stable flow of great animated  family film titles.    More generally, the Pay 1 titles from our other output deals will increase in the coming months as EPIX,  Relativity, Film District, Open Road and others provide Netflix with films that have already tallied more  than $1.3 billion in domestic box office, including Thor, Transformers 3, Captain America, Super  8, The Immortals and Footloose.  Last quarter, we explained that the evolution of video streaming services to a large extent reflects the  legacy of television networks: namely, historical reliance upon exclusive content as a differentiator.  Consistent with this practice, we are increasingly licensing content on an exclusive basis.     Domestic Streaming Competition  We compete for viewing time with a very wide range of providers.  As other viewing solutions for TV  shows and movies get better, we will face increased competition and potential decreased viewing share.  On the other hand, if our service improves faster than others, we will increase our viewing share.   One class of competitors is the other over-the-top pure plays such as Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime.   We  expect Amazon to continue to offer their video service as a free extra with Prime domestically but also  to brand their video subscription offering as a standalone service at a price less than ours.  Both Amazon  and Hulu Plus's content is a fraction of our content, and we believe their respective total viewing hours  are each less than 10% of ours.   In the case of Hulu Plus, subscribers have to pay for the service ($7.99)  and still watch commercials (unlike, commercial-free Netflix).  Even if Hulu could afford our level of  content spend, at the same price consumers would prefer commercial-free Netflix over commercial- interrupted Hulu Plus.    As we've often said, we see the biggest long term threat as TV Everywhere, and in particular, HBO GO,  the leading implementation of TV Everywhere to date.   HBO has some great content, particularly their  original series, but today for most people it is locked behind a linear interface, or at best, behind a DVR  interface and in all cases tethered to a linear subscription plan.   As HBO GO grows and becomes the  primary way that consumers experience HBO, it will become a much more effective competitor for  viewing time.  Similarly, Showtime's TV Everywhere application is very impressive and just starting to  gain traction.  Every major network is investing in their Internet application, on tablets, smart TVs,  phones, game consoles, and laptops.  Pricing is simple: the consumer just authenticates with their MVPD  provider.   Over the next few years, UIs will evolve in astounding ways, such as allowing viewers to      4  watch eight simultaneous games on ESPN, color coding where the best action is in a given moment or  allowing Olympics fans the ability to control their own slow-motion replays.  A decade from now,  choosing a linear feed from a broadcast grid of 200 channels will seem like using a rotary dial telephone.  Just as broadcast networks have substantially transformed themselves into cable channels over the last  twenty years, both broadcast and cable networks will effectively also become Internet networks like  Netflix.   As a pure-play we have many advantages, however, just as cable did over broadcast.   We are  100% on-demand and highly-personalized.  Our brand is broad, rather than niche, so we can combine  the benefits of multiple channels into one service.   Additionally, our Internet culture enables us to  create and drive social TV, recommendations TV, and other Internet innovations faster than our cable  and broadcast network competitors.     As cable networks developed, they were able to both compete with broadcast networks, and to bolster  broadcast networks economics through syndication.   Today it is accepted practice for networks to  license parts of their content to other networks, if they get paid well enough.   That is the world of  content licensing in which we live.   In that sense, we are just another network competing for viewing  time with, and licensing content from, other networks.   VPPA Update  In 46 of the 47 countries we serve, members can currently enjoy automatic seamless video sharing  between friends on Facebook, in the same manner that they can choose to enjoy automatic seamless  sharing between friends of their music listening and news story viewing.    As we've highlighted before, under a U.S. law enacted in the 1980s, companies that rent or sell physical  video tapes or DVDs are subject to particular privacy rules.   This law, the Video Privacy Protection Act,  or VPPA, creates confusion over our ability to allow U.S. members to choose to automatically share their  viewing history with their friends.   A broad bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House recognized  the benefits of modernizing and simplifying this law and passed H.R. 2471, an amendment to the VPPA  that clarifies the ability of consumers to elect to share their viewing history on an ongoing basis if they  so wish.   Now this proposed amendment is with the Senate, and they have scheduled a hearing on the  VPPA for next week.    International Streaming  In our 5th quarter since launching international operations, we reached 1.9 million international  streaming members in Q4.   Canada  In Canada in Q4, we enhanced our offering with fresh movies and TV shows from existing output deals,  as well as new deals. For TV, we've significantly improved our television catalog with new content from  FOX, Sony, and AMC and for film, we have continued to add Pay 1 film titles such as Black Swan, True  Grit, The Chronicles of Narnia and Rango, as well as great catalog titles like Pulp Fiction. The      5  addition of lots of compelling new shows and movies both drove increased hours viewed per member  and member acquisition during the quarter.   The market opportunity in Canada is exciting enough that we continue to invest in the content library,  meaning that we'll run at roughly break even for two quarters, and we expect to return to a positive  contribution profit starting in Q3 of this year, two years after our initial launch.  Our plan after that is to  grow our contribution margin as we continue to grow our membership.     Latin America  In Latin America, we ended the year with about the same number of members as we had in Canada at  the same time post-launch last year.  Latin America has about 4x more broadband households than  Canada; so, our focus is on capturing a larger portion of the market opportunity.  Latin America presents unique challenges relative to our other markets; namely, low device penetration,  high piracy, varying preferences for subtitles, and relatively low credit card usage for ecommerce. We  are quickly learning what content works best in the region, and are adjusting our content library  accordingly. We have already nearly doubled our content library since launch, adding considerably more  U.S. and local movies and TV.  We are rapidly increasing the accessibility of our service by adding more  subtitles in both Spanish and Portuguese (in addition to dubs), as well as expanding the range of Netflix  enabled devices in the region. Finally, as expected upon launch, we've found that processing  ecommerce consumer payments is quite challenging as compared with North America and Europe. To  overcome this challenge, we are working with our local payment partners to optimize our systems,  exploring adding new payment methods and testing various trial campaigns to improve conversion.   We are committed to the region over the long-term, encouraged by the prospect of building a large,  profitable business over time, just as DIRECTV has done.   UK and Ireland  Our UK and Ireland launch at the beginning of the month was very successful, and we're seeing faster  member growth than we did when we launched Canada.   As our membership in the UK and Ireland  grows, we'll be able to invest more and more in content.  We have a great selection of new films from  Lionsgate and others, and will have on our service such highly-anticipated films as Hunger Games and  The Hobbit, in addition to catalog movies from 5 of the 6 major studios.  On the TV side, we have  current Hollywood TV from the major networks and three key local channels.    In the UK and Ireland we launched with our best Facebook implementation to date.  The positive social  effects get stronger as the number of connected members rises, so we are working hard on making  connecting very easy, and the connected experience very enjoyable.  Just as in the U.S. where our primary long-term competition will likely be TV Everywhere, in the UK our  long-term competition will likely be Sky Go offering Sky Movies and Sky Atlantic on-demand.  (Sky  Atlantic is mostly HBO Originals content, and Sky Movies is one channel with the Pay 1 movie output  from all six major U.S. movie studios).  We believe we will compete very effectively against Sky Go, given      6  our advantages of being an unbundled low-priced offering with broad content that is purely on-demand,  and personalized. Over the coming years, we hope to be able to grow large enough to outbid Sky for one  or more major studio output deals, as we did this year for MGM.    Finally, in the UK, but not in Ireland, we also have the free BBC iPlayer and Amazon's LOVEFiLM as  competitors for viewing time.  LOVEFiLM is primarily a DVD-by-mail service with 2 million DVD  subscribers in the UK, Germany and the Nordics.  iPlayer is an excellent over-the-top last few days catch- up service, free for UK residents.   Total International Results & Outlook    In Q4, international revenue of $29 million was in-line with expectations, while contribution loss of $60  million was slightly better due to lower content expenses.  In Q1, the combined investments in both Latin America and the UK and Ireland will result in a total  international contribution loss of between $108 and $118 million. In future quarters, we intend to  continue to increase our investment in the content libraries in each market, just as we have done in  Canada since launch. Doing so improves the consumer experience, builds strong word of mouth and  positive brand awareness, and drives additional acquisition, all elements of a strong foundation for long- term success. As we improve the service, we grow membership and thus we expect the quarterly  international losses to moderate slightly.   DVD  Q4 Results  As expected, DVD members declined this quarter to 11.2 million due to the continued impact of the  price changes, as hybrid members continued to predominantly choose a streaming-only plan over a  higher priced hybrid plan.  Both hybrid cancellation and migration to streaming-only plans ebbed  through the quarter. We added over 600k unique domestic members in Q4, ending the quarter with  24.4 million.   The domestic DVD segment delivered $194 million of contribution profit in Q4, representing a 52.4%  contribution margin.  The slight out-performance relative to our guidance was predominantly  attributable to a higher ASP than forecasted due to more DVD members staying on 2+ disc plans.    Outlook  While DVD members declined sharply over the last two quarters, the weekly rate of DVD cancellations  has subsided from peak levels in September. Looking out across 2012, we expect continued attrition  among our DVD members. Specifically, in Q1, we expect net losses of DVD members of approximately  1.5 million, with the sequential decline moderating in future quarters.   The DVD business model is predominantly variable cost based. So, as the size of the market opportunity  continues to decline, we expect healthy contribution profit margins to be maintained. Meanwhile, for      7  customers with DVD needs (namely, completeness, simplicity, and with limited broadband), our product  is priced 20% lower than our nearest competitor, and our service remains better and faster.  Earlier this month, Warner Home Entertainment announced it was moving the availability date for rental  DVDs to kiosk and all subscription by mail services to 56 days post the release date for retail sale. This  followed its move to impose a 28 day delay on store based rentals. While we didn't like the new release  date schemes, we decided that it was better for our members for us to maintain a direct relationship  with Warner under the selling terms it has imposed. The alternative was to secure discs through  multiple retail and third party channels, which can be unreliable and may have added to the time it  takes to procure enough DVDs to meet member demand. We suspect there will be increasingly  differentiated dates as the studios re-configure their shrinking packaged goods businesses.  Product Improvement  Constantly improving our service is key to satisfying current members and attracting new ones. The  better we make the Netflix experience, the more hours are watched, translating into increased retention  and strong word of mouth referral.  In Q4, we announced several product enhancements to that end.    We improved the Netflix experience on the Xbox 360, launching a user interface (UI) that is compatible  with Kinect, allowing members to navigate the Netflix UI with voice and gesture.  The new Xbox app  makes substantial improvements in the streaming experience, reducing the amount of re-buffering,  accelerating start-up, and delivering higher quality streams. We introduced a new UI for the iPad,  making it easier and quicker for members to find what to watch, and we expanded our presence on  tablets as a launch partner of both Amazon's Kindle Fire and the Barnes & Noble NOOK Tablet.     Following our well-received launch of the Just for Kids feature in July, we rolled out the feature to the  Nintendo Wii. Additionally, we made updates to the Netflix app for Android which improved the user  experience and increased the breadth of Android devices supported.  Finally, we had several  personalization algorithm breakthroughs for how we sort titles in each category, making it easier for our  members to find movies and TV shows they'll love.      Original Programming    Our first Netflix original series, \"Lilyhammer,\" a fish-out-of-water story set in Norway and starring \"The  Sopranos\" mainstay and E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt, will debut on our service on February  6th in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.  All eight first season episodes of \"Lilyhammer\" will be  available at once, so Netflix members can enjoy the first season as quickly as they like, instead of having  to wait a week for each new episode as they would with linear programming.    More Netflix original series are planned for 2012 and 2013, including House of Cards (Q4 2012), and an  exclusive and original fourth season of Arrested Development (2013). Our spending on original  programming is intended to allow us to test a new licensing model using a small portion of our content      8  budget. If Lilyhammer or House of Cards is popular enough on Netflix so that the fees we've paid for  each are in-line with that of other equally-popular content on Netflix during the same time period, we'll  consider them a success.   Global Profitability: Q4 Results & Outlook  Q4 net income of $41 million, and $0.73 per share, exceeded our expectations, predominantly driven by  the out-performance of domestic streaming contribution profit discussed above.  In general, member growth or contraction in a quarter effects revenue the following quarter more than  the quarter of the change.   The sharp decline in DVD members in Q4 means that in Q1 our DVD revenue  will decline by about as much as our streaming revenue will increase, resulting in approximately flat  sequential revenue in Q1.     Due to the increased investment in international, in particular the launch of the UK, our current outlook  is for a consolidated loss of between $9 and $27 million in Q1. While contribution profit from domestic  streaming will grow sequentially, it will not be sufficient to offset the sequential decline in DVD profits  (~$50 million), and the sequential increase in our international losses (~$50 million), as well as cover our  global G&A and Technology & Development costs.   As a result, we expect modest quarterly losses, as well as losses for the calendar year. Until we achieve  our goal of returning to global profitability, we do not intend to launch additional international markets.    Q4 Free Cash Flow   In Q4, FCF of $34 million slightly trailed net income of $41 million. Significant sources of cash flow in the  quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation and an increase in accounts payable  related to timing of marketing payments. These sources of cash were more than offset by cash  payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense), a decline in deferred revenue and an interest  payment on our notes.   In the quarter, we continued to add to our domestic and international content libraries. For the full year  2011, we added $2.3 billion of streaming content library assets (or, $1.6 billion net of amortization  expense) to our balance sheet. Since we have been generally successful in matching payment terms with  the expense, the growth in streaming content assets also coincided with an increase in our content  related liabilities of $1.5 billion, representing payment obligations under our content licenses not yet  due.    As we add original content in the last quarter of this year, we expect payments for originals to weigh on  FCF as they typically require more up-front payments than non-original content license payment terms.       9    Q4 Financing  Our standard practice with regard to managing our capital structure has been to evaluate on an on- going basis the appropriate cash level and capital structure for the business. In Q4, given the pain from  our price changes and the impact to our 2012 outlook, this analysis led us to the decision to strengthen  our balance sheet by raising $400 million of additional capital from two long-term oriented  shareholders. $200 million was raised through the sale of equity (2.86 million shares at $70 per share),  and $200 million was raised through the private placement of zero-coupon convertible notes.  We have  no intentions to spend this additional capital; it is merely a stronger safety-net for an aggressive, fast  moving business with a big opportunity.    After the financing, we finished the quarter with $798 million in cash and equivalents.   Metrics evolution  As stated in our January 2011 investor letter, net additions, along with revenue and contribution profit,  are our core performance measurements for each of our segments.  This is the final letter in which we  will provide gross additions, churn and SAC in our domestic results, conforming to how we have been  reporting our international streaming results.  Starting this quarter, we will be also providing guidance for paid members, in addition to our traditional  guidance for total members. Since paid membership drives revenue and profit, we believe a focus on  this metric is most relevant for our financial discussions. We will continue to report free, paid, and total  subscribers by segment.      As we evolve our focus from DVD to streaming, we are slightly updating our definition of membership  starting with this quarter's membership guidance. Members who are on payment hold will no longer be  counted as members, while members who cancel mid-period will be counted until their service ceases at  the end of the period. We estimate the net effect of these changes will be less than 200k fewer  domestic streaming members than we would otherwise report in Q1. There is no effect on revenue from  this change.      10    CEO Stock Sales  Reed has some 10-year options expiring in Q1, and will be making a one-time sale of those shares as  part of a 10b5-1 plan, but is otherwise not selling stock this quarter.    CMO Search  As we announced last week, we're looking for a CMO who today probably runs marketing at a cable  network or a mobile phone network, and has strong global experience.  Typically these searches take 4-6  months.  In the meantime, our long time executive Jessie Becker is our Interim CMO, and is a candidate  for the role also.   Leslie Kilgore made huge contributions over the last 12 years to nearly every part of  our business, and we're very happy to have her join our Board of Directors to continue to help Netflix  prosper.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: We grew annual revenue 35% to $16 billion in 2018, and nearly doubled operating profits to $1.6 billion. Fueling this growth was our high member satisfaction, which propelled us to finish 2018 with 139 million paying memberships, up 9 million from quarter start and up 29 million from the beginning of the year. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Average paid memberships and ASP rose 26% and 3% year over year, respectively. Excluding the impact of F\/X, international ASP increased 6% year over year and 1% sequentially. Foreign exchange headwinds continued to move against us in the quarter, similar to the trend we saw in Q3'18. As expected, Q4 operating margin dipped to 5.2% vs. 7.5% prior year due to so many titles launching in the quarter. Our full year 2018 operating margin of 10% was in-line with our target. EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.41 included a $22 million non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We added a record 8.8m paid memberships (1.5m in the US and 7.3m internationally), higher than our beginning-of-quarter expectation for 7.6m paid net adds and up 33% year over year. For the full year, paid net adds grew 33% to 29m vs. the 22m we added in 2017. 1As discussed in our last letter, we reclassified certain personnel costs from G&A to Cost of Revenues and   Marketing, and from Technology & Development to Other Cost of Revenues. This change has no impact on operating profit or margin or total operating expenses and historical quarterly pro forma financial statements for 2016-2018 can be found here.   The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q1'19, we forecast global paid net additions of 8.9m, +8% year over year, with 1.6m in the US and 7.3m internationally. Our Q1'19 revenue forecast represents 21% year over year growth (27% FX neutral). Our paid member growth is fairly consistent. Quarter to quarter, revenue growth varies due to factors like FX changes and timing of price changes across different markets. For example, we forecast Q1'19 international ASP will be up year over year, excluding FX. We change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience. We want to ensure that Netflix is a good value for the money and that our entry price is affordable. We just increased our US prices for new members, as we did in Q4 in Canada and Argentina, and in Japan in Q3. The new pricing in the US will be phased in for existing members over Q1 and Q2, which we anticipate will lift ASP. Our multi-year plan is to keep significantly growing our content while increasing our revenue faster to expand our operating margins. We're targeting a 9% operating margin in Q1'19, which we expect will grow over the course of the year and our full year operating margin target for 2019 remains 13% vs. 10% in 2018. A majority of our revenue is not in dollars, so when there are material FX moves, investors know to expect proportionate top line changes. In such FX cases, we'll seek to adjust our prices and costs over time, but since that will lag the revenue changes, and since we don't hedge FX, this would lead to short-term margin variations from our steady progression. 2Content In its first 4 weeks on Netflix, we estimate that Bird Box from director Susanne Bier will be enjoyed by   over 80 million member households, and we are seeing high repeat viewing. In combination with our other movie hits such as: Dumplin' from director Anne Fletcher, Chris Columbus-produced The Christmas    Chronicles, Alfonso Cuarón's critically acclaimed ROMA, Paul Greengrass' 22 July, Tamara Jenkins'      Private Life and the Coen brothers' The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, we are beginning to have our original     movie offering mirror the success of our series offering for consumer enjoyment. The global reach of our  audience and the quality of the experience producing for Netflix continues to attract the world's top directors. We are expanding the film market: while our films drew bigger and bigger audiences in Q4, the North American box office also set records. Today, five weeks after its Netflix debut, ROMA is still   being exhibited in theaters and has played on over 900 unique screens around the world, including some special 70mm format presentations. People love films...at home and in theaters.   Around the world, our titles are not only pleasing consumers, but they are transforming the careers of our talent. Elite, our Spanish original, has been a huge success with over 20 million member households   around the world enjoying the series in its first four weeks on service1. In addition to being highly watched, social engagement has been phenomenal and the cast's popularity on social media skyrocketed, continuing to demonstrate our ability to be a launching pad for talent. We're making significant investments in productions all over the world because we have seen that great stories transcend borders. For example, Bodyguard (co-produced with BBC One, from ITV Studios) ranks   as one of our most enjoyed co-productions. Baby, our second original series from Italy, and The    1 For series, due to their highly variable length, we count a viewer if they substantially complete at least one episode (70%). For a film, it is if they substantially complete the film (70%). 3Protector, our first Turkish original series, both saw strong viewing both inside and outside their home  countries. All three of these debut seasons from around the world were each enjoyed by over 10 million member households in their first four weeks. From Hollywood, in Q4 we launched new global scripted series like The Haunting of Hill House, Chilling    Adventures of Sabrina, and The Kominsky Method (from Chuck Lorre, starring Michael Douglas and Alan    Arkin), as well as new seasons of returning shows like adult animation Big Mouth and Narcos: Mexico,     the latest installment in the Narcos franchise. We were very pleased with our launch of You three weeks     ago; we estimate it will be watched by over 40 million member households in its first 4 weeks on Netflix. This binge-worthy show started as a Lifetime linear series in the US, but is now a full Netflix global original. A week ago, we launched Sex Education from the UK and it is also tracking to be a huge hit   (estimated over 40 million households watching the title within the first 4 weeks). Netflix films and TV shows picked up five 2019 Golden Globe wins, including Best Comedy Series for The    Kominsky Method and Best Actor in a Comedy Series for Michael Douglas and Best Actor in a Drama  Series for Richard Madden from Bodyguard. Alfonso Cuarón won the Golden Globe for Best Feature   Director and Best Foreign Language Feature for ROMA.   As a result of our success with original content, we're becoming less focused on 2nd run programming. For example, we launched our originals strategy for the unscripted genre only two years ago. Today, Netflix originals, like Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, account for a majority of total unscripted view share   on Netflix, while viewing of all unscripted programming has increased meaningfully during that time. We are ready to pay top-of-market prices for second run content when the studios, networks and producers are willing to sell, but we are also prepared to keep our members ecstatic with our incredible original content if others choose to retain their content for their own services. Looking forward in 2019, we will be launching many new highly-anticipated titles including The Umbrella  Academy (February 15th); Triple Frontier from J.C. Chandor (March); The Irishman from Martin Scorsese;      6 Underground from Michael Bay; and The Politician from Ryan Murphy; as well as returning seasons of    The Crown led by a new cast including Olivia Colman, Ben Daniels, and Helena Bonham Carter; 13   Reasons Why, La Casa de Papel, Elite, and, of course, Season 3 of the epic Stranger Things, coming to    members all around the world on July 4th. Product and Partnerships We test many different approaches to our business in order to learn how to grow quickly. We continue to test new plan options (both below and above our existing offers) in certain markets. We are also expanding our bundled offerings which now include: Telefonica in Spain, Comcast and T-Mobile in the US, Sky in the UK and Germany, Free in France, and KDDI in Japan. As discussed in our Q1'18 investor letter, in the case of these hard bundles, we report revenue net of economics we share with our partners. On December 28, we released Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, our first interactive movie for adults,   allowing viewers to make decisions on behalf of the lead character. We've created thousands of different pathways to make it through the story, including multiple endings. This level of complexity 4necessitated the creation of a system to make such storytelling manageable. Branch Manager helped series creator and writer Charlie Brooker and our internal teams produce this popular multi-branched movie. We'll be using Branch Manager to construct additional interactive projects going forward. We're thrilled with the global excitement that Bandersnatch has created and it serves as a strong example of   how we can marry technology and entertainment to evolve video storytelling. Competition In the US, we earn around 10% of television screen time2 and less than that of mobile screen time. In other countries, we earn a lower percentage of screen time due to lower penetration of our service. We earn consumer screen time, both mobile and television, away from a very broad set of competitors. We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few   minutes in October, our viewing and signups spiked for that time. Hulu is small compared to YouTube for viewing time, and they are successful in the US, but non-existent in Canada, which creates a comparison point: our penetration in the two countries is pretty similar. There are thousands of competitors in this highly-fragmented market vying to entertain consumers and low barriers to entry for those with great experiences. Our growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen time experiences from which consumers choose. Our focus is not on Disney+, Amazon or others, but on how we can improve our experience for our members. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q4'18 was -$1.3 billion vs. -$0.5 billion in Q4'17, totalling -$3 billion for 2018 (compared to our original forecasted range of -$3 to -$4 billion for the full year). We expect 2019 FCF will be similar to 2018 and then will improve each year thereafter (assuming, as we do, no material transactions). This FCF improvement will be driven by growing operating margin, which will allow us to fund more of our investment needs internally. During Q4, we raised 1.1 billion 4.625% senior notes and $800 million 6.375% senior notes (weighted € average coupon of 5.3%). As long as we judge our marginal after-tax cost of debt to be lower than our marginal cost of equity, we'll continue to finance our working capital needs through the high yield market. We finished the year with cash of $3.8 billion and our $500 million unsecured credit facility remains undrawn. Spence Neumann joins as CFO We're pleased that Spence Neumann has joined Netflix as our new CFO and we thank David Wells for his many contributions to Netflix. Spence is a veteran entertainment executive who brings a wealth of experience and new perspectives to the company as we expand our original content around the world. 2 We serve on average about 100 million hours a day to television screens in the US, and we estimate television screens in the US are on about a billion hours daily (120m homes x 2 TVs x 4 hours, plus hotels, bars, etc). 5Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2018, July 2018, April 2018,  January 2018, October 2017,  July 2017, April 2017, January 2017.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  6  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Netflix added nearly 3 million streaming members in Q1, bringing our total to over 26 million global streaming members, and strengthening our position as the world's leading Internet TV network. We anticipate returning to global profitability in Q2, and plan to launch our next international market in Q4. We are constantly improving our service with better personalization, better user-interfaces, better streaming, and more content. As a result, per-member viewing hours set new records in Q1 and are on track to do so again in Q2, on a year-over-year basis. We launched our service in the UK and Ireland in January and are very pleased that, after the first 90 days, we had substantially more members than we had after the first 90 days of Canada or Latin America. 1    2  Domestic Streaming  Q1 Results  Domestically, we achieved strong quarter-over-quarter growth in streaming members, adding 1.7  million total net additions (and 1.9 million paid net additions) in the quarter, and reaching 23.4 million  total streaming members.    New content additions, steady improvement to the Netflix user-interfaces and personalization  algorithms, and the receding impact of last year's brand hit, all continue to contribute to incremental  improvements in our domestic streaming business and the resulting member growth.    The domestic streaming segment delivered $67 million of contribution profit, equivalent to a 13%  contribution margin. We exceeded our domestic streaming contribution margin target of around 11%,  due to slightly lower than expected content, delivery, and customer service expenses.  Outlook – Increased Seasonality in Net Adds  We anticipate that U.S. streaming contribution margin will expand in Q2 to about 15%.   For Q3 onward,  we are targeting 100 bps of average margin expansion per quarter, consistent with our January  guidance.   We think our 2012 domestic streaming net adds will be about the same as in 2010 (about 7 million), and  that gross adds will approximately follow the 2010 seasonal pattern.    At the same time, we have more net add quarterly seasonality this year due to our larger starting  membership base for the same amount of annual net adds.  In other words, given the same gross add  quarterly distribution as in 2010, and the same annual net adds, it is inherent that the quarterly  variation in net adds is amplified.  We have included an appendix at the end of this letter to illustrate  this.    Due to this increased net add quarterly seasonality, Q2 net adds will be below those of 2010, despite Q2  gross adds following the traditional seasonal pattern, and despite us expecting to match 2010 in annual  net additions.    We see nothing new or particularly concerning this quarter to date in our member viewing, acquisition  and retention.  All are healthy.     Domestic Content Library  As a result of the significant investments in our streaming library over the last 18 months, we have  meaningfully increased the quantity and quality of the TV shows and movies on the service. Going  forward, we continue to sign new agreements to bolster our content offering, while also benefiting from  our established relationships with all major producers of film and TV in the U.S. that continue to ensure  a steady flow of new titles to the service. As we stated in our January letter, we are growing content      3  spend sequentially every quarter, but slower than domestic streaming revenue growth to allow for  margin expansion.   Feature Films  In Q1, we added several notable new release Pay TV 1 feature film titles to the service, including  Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature, Rango, The Lincoln Lawyer, and Justin Bieber:  Never Say Never.  Meanwhile, our studio partners continue to provide additional high quality catalog  product.    We recently announced a new multi-year licensing agreement with The Weinstein Company that will  make foreign language, documentary and certain other movies exclusively available for Netflix members  in the U.S.  As a result, this year's Academy Award winner for Best Picture The Artist and Best  Documentary Undefeated will be shown in their Pay TV 1 window exclusively on Netflix.   Looking forward to Q2, the volume of exclusive titles we receive through agreements with several mini- major distributors will steadily increase.  Notably, the action-thriller Killer Elite distributed by Open  Road Films will come to Netflix along with several films from Film District including Golden Globe  nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, In the Land of Blood and Honey, critically acclaimed action- drama, Drive, and The Rum Diary starring Johnny Depp.  Meanwhile, titles arriving from Epix are  getting even better with Thor and Transformers: Dark of the Moon, also coming this quarter.  The Starz deal for 15 Disney Pay TV 1 output titles, plus some catalog films, ended in February.  There  was no discernible change in churn or viewing levels.   Instead, the trend towards watching episodic TV,  like Breaking Bad, on Netflix continues to grow.  On a year-over-year basis, our content is stronger  than it has ever been, and our viewing per member is at a record high level.     TV Content  Our selection of TV content also got stronger in Q1, as we added  shows like Supernatural and 90210  from the CW, Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior and the Showtime series United States of Tara from  CBS, AMC's The Killing and A&E's Breakout Kings from Fox, Being Human (U.S.) from Muse  Entertainment, and Comedy Central's Workaholics from Viacom Media Networks. Meanwhile, we  continue to add new seasons of existing series every quarter. In addition, we recently announced our  first deal with Hasbro, providing Netflix with a wide variety of new kids content including My Little  Pony and Transformers: Prime.      In the past, we have said that our licensing of complete back seasons of on-air TV series is not only a  great experience for Netflix members, but can help build the audience for new seasons. We saw this  demonstrated recently with the premiere of Season 5 of Mad Men on AMC achieving its biggest  audience yet (20% higher than last season's premiere), subsequent to the first four seasons becoming  available on Netflix last summer.  Even now, the most watched episode of Mad Men on any given day  on Netflix is the first episode of the first season. This means we are still growing the fan base for this  show nearly 6 years after it first premiered on television.      4  Domestic Streaming Competition  We compete for consumers' viewing time with a very wide range of video sources, including linear TV  (MVPD and free-to-air), DVR, over-the-top (OTT) pure plays such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant  Video, and authenticated streaming offerings of the MVPDs and cable networks (TV Everywhere).   Hulu launched its first original series, and has continued its platform (Wii) and country (Japan)  expansion.   While we have ten times more domestic paid members, and we added over three times  more domestic net additions than Hulu in Q1, we do watch them carefully.   Most of their viewing, we  believe, is from current-season broadcast-network content.    Amazon continues to grow its U.S. video content library available through Amazon Prime.  We think they  are still substantially behind Hulu in viewing hours.  Given Amazon's size and ambitions, we continue to  track their progress carefully as well.    As we've often said, we see the biggest long-term competition for viewing hours from MVPDs and cable  networks through their TV Everywhere offerings. Consistent with this view, we began to see the  consumer promise of TV Everywhere emerge in Q1, with all major networks and many MVPDs investing  in their Internet applications and taking steps to evolve to Internet TV networks. Among recent  developments, both HBO GO as well as Comcast's Xfinity application became available on the Xbox.   Additionally, Comcast announced its Streampix streaming service available to current Comcast  subscribers. Given the superiority of our content selection, user interfaces and device ubiquity, we don't  currently see any meaningful near-term impact on our business from these developments.   Internet Caps Should Apply Equally, or Not At All.   Comcast caps its residential broadband customers at 250 gigabytes per month.   On the Xbox, the Netflix  app, the Hulu app, and the HBO GO app, are all subject to this cap.  But Comcast has decided that its  own Xfinity Xbox app is not subject to this 250 gigabyte cap.   This is not neutral in any sense.   The Xbox  is a pure Internet device with a single IP address, works over a consumer's home wifi, and data to the  Xbox is Internet data.  When the Xfinity Xbox app uses lots of bandwidth, it competes for that  bandwidth with all other Internet usage and users in the home.  The Xfinity Xbox app speaks TCP\/IP  like any other Internet device. The only difference between the Xfinity Xbox data and Netflix Xbox data  is the Xfinity data is favored by Comcast exempting it from the cap.    Comcast could raise the cap and make it apply equally or just eliminate the caps.   Net neutrality  principles mean a level playing field for all Internet applications.    International Streaming  We surpassed 3 million total international streaming members this quarter, growing 65% sequentially,  and adding 1.2 million total net additions (and nearly 1 million paid net additions).  Just six quarters after  our first international market launch, our non-U.S. members account for nearly 12% of total (and 10% of  paid) Netflix streaming members.      5  UK and Ireland  The largest driver of growth in international members in Q1 was the launch of our service in the UK and  Ireland at the beginning of January. From the start, we achieved the highest net additions we've ever  seen in the first 90 days of an international market launch.   While the UK is a very competitive market, we have found that the existence of competition can be  beneficial for driving interest and demand in our service.  The existence of other over-the-top (OTT)  streaming and on-demand services creates a high level of product understanding and acceptance among  consumers and that, in turn, increases their willingness to try Netflix.  In January, we launched with an impressive and diverse base of movies and TV shows, and as our  membership continues to grow, we'll be able to add further to the content library.  Lately, we've offered  members new movies from our existing deals, including Pay TV 1 and 2 titles like Insidious, Horrid  Henry: The Movie, and Angels & Demons, as well as iconic catalog titles, such as, Pulp Fiction, The  Godfather, and Top Gun.  In the coming months, Netflix will be the Pay TV 1 UK home of 21 Jump Street and The Hobbit from  MGM, The Woman in Black from Momentum and the recent monster hit Hunger Games from  Lionsgate. Collectively, our upcoming offerings account for 20% of UK box office year to date, compared  to our competitor LOVEFiLM, whose deals we estimate account for around 6%.  Our TV offering is also strong, with previous seasons of current shows from the major U.S. networks and  three key local channels. We are particularly excited to be the UK and Ireland TV premiere destination  for shows like, Breaking Bad and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  From our experience to date, we continue to believe our biggest competitors will be Sky Movies and Sky  Atlantic (and potentially Sky's yet-to-be-launched Now TV streaming service), as well as LOVEFiLM.   Without details on consumer pricing or content selection, it remains unclear whether Sky's Now TV will  be a meaningful competitor. Ultimately, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in the UK and  Ireland based on our content selection as well as our superior streaming technology.   If the UK Competition Commission eventually forces Sky Movies to not control the Pay TV 1 output from  all six major studios, that then may provide an opportunity for Netflix to bid earlier for major studio  deals than otherwise would have been the case.  It is premature to know how it will play out.   In the UK and Ireland we launched with our most broad-scale Facebook integration to date, and are  pleased with the level of consumer engagement.   Social TV show and movie discovery is heavily used by  our Facebook connected members.    Canada  Canada continues to be a strong market for Netflix.  Member growth remained healthy in Q1, and we  ended the quarter with nearly double the members we had a year ago.      6  Our on-going investment in new content for Canada is driving increased engagement and hours viewed.  Just this month, through our Pay TV 1 deals we've added such blockbusters as, Thor, and  Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon, with Kung-Fu Panda II and Captain America coming soon.  We are also licensing for our members some great Canadian content, including Dragon's Den, Arctic  Air, and Mr. D, three of the top rated shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC).  Even with our continued content investment, we anticipate a small contribution profit in Canada in Q2  and will remain profitable in this market going forward. This is a quarter earlier than our January  expectations for Canadian profitability, made possible by the continued strength of member growth and  increased efficiency of our marketing spend. Long-term, we intend to steadily increase our contribution  margin in much the same way as we are doing for our U.S. streaming business.   Latin America  As mentioned in our January investor letter, Latin America differs significantly from our other markets.  While there is limited current OTT streaming competition in the region (different from the UK), this lack  of OTT competition means that the concept of on-demand streaming video (outside of piracy and  YouTube) is nascent, requiring us to do more work in driving consumer understanding and acceptance of  our streaming service.  In addition, Latin America presents unique infrastructure challenges relative to  our other markets; namely, low device penetration, under-developed Internet infrastructure and  relatively low credit card usage as well as general consumer payment challenges for ecommerce.  For  example, many banks turn down all ecommerce debit card transactions due to fraud risk, making it a  more challenging environment than our other markets.  To offset these challenges and improve the consumer experience, we have been continually expanding  the content offering. In Q1, we added new series to our TV offerings including, Dexter, Ancient  Aliens and Charmed, as well a host of popular feature films including, Twilight: New Moon,  Gnomeo & Juliet, The Incredibles, Insidious,  Couples Retreat, and Saving Private Perez (the  top Mexican film of 2011). For Q2, we are beginning to ramp up the number of Pay TV 1 titles on our  service, including Best Picture winner The Artist in June; and Something Borrowed, and From Prada  to Nada, during the quarter.     In Q1, we increased our subtitle coverage to nearly 100% of non-kids English language content (in  addition to previously available dubbing) to accommodate varying viewing preferences. Finally, we're  very focused on optimizing our payment processing to continue to improve free trial conversions to paid  members, as well as exploring adding new payment methods to expand the addressable market of  consumers.  Our revenue and membership is growing in Latin America, and we are rapidly learning.   The odds of us  building a large, profitable business in Latin America are very good, but it will take longer than we  initially thought.         7  Total International Results & Outlook    In Q1, international revenue of $43 million was up more than 3X from a year ago, and in-line with  expectations. Contribution loss of $103 million was better than anticipated due to slightly higher  revenue combined with lower than expected content, subtitling and marketing expenses.  In connection  with our Latin American market, we incurred increased subtitling costs in Q1 which have been  capitalized into the content library ($5 million, net of amortization).  Last year, such costs were  immaterial and expensed as incurred.  We expect subtitling costs to continue to be meaningful as we  launch additional non-English markets in the future.  So, our forecast incorrectly assumed $5 million in  expense.    In Q2, we expect Canada to deliver a small profit, and the growth of members and revenue in Latin  America and the UK and Ireland to lower the contribution loss in each of those markets. In total,  international contribution loss is expected to sequentially improve to a range of between ($98) and  ($86) million.   Our early success in Canada – sustainably profitable less than 2 years after launch – is probably unusual  given the proximity of Canada to the U.S. and the broad pre-launch awareness of our brand.  As a result,  we expect Latin America and the UK and Ireland to take longer than 8 quarters to reach sustained profits  as we build membership and invest in content improvements.   Given our expected return to global profitability in Q2, and how well we've been received in the UK,  we've decided to open an additional attractive European market in Q4 of this year.   Assuming  continued success, and additional markets we can enter with confidence, we expect to roughly match  the roll-out of new markets to global profitability for the foreseeable future.    DVD  DVD members declined this quarter to 10.1 million, slightly better than our expectations. About 7  million of these 10 million also subscribe to our streaming service.  Going forward, we believe DVD will  continue to decline but at a slower pace than the past few quarters.      The domestic DVD segment delivered $146 million of contribution profit in Q1, representing a 46%  contribution margin. We expect contribution margin to be roughly flat in coming quarters.   Product Improvement & Partnering  We are constantly working to improve the Netflix experience so our members can easily sign up, find  something great to watch and then relax and enjoy our service.  Q1 was no exception in terms of  continual improvements to the service.   As mentioned above, we improved our Latin American customer experience by increasing subtitle  coverage to nearly one hundred percent of non-kids content, while in the UK and Ireland, we launched  our most thorough Facebook integration to date, allowing members to share what they watch on      8  Facebook and giving them the ability to get great viewing ideas from their friends. We also continued  our efforts to better serve families, launching our Just for Kids feature on the PS3 as a follow up to the  successful launches of this feature on the website, Apple TV, and Wii.   Finally, based on successful test  results, we rolled out a smarter personalization algorithm to determine members' Top 10 suggested title  lists.       In March, we launched a deeper integration with the Apple TV, allowing consumers to sign up for Netflix  directly on device and pay via their iTunes account.  We've been very pleased that this simplification for  new users has been popular, and that the integration has gone so well.  Members who sign up through  Apple TV are full Netflix members, and can use Netflix on multiple devices. The Apple TV relationship  covers all of our markets.       Many companies like Apple already have a billing relationship with millions of people, including ISPs,  major retailers, MVPDs, and others.   In cases where these firms have an efficient means to generate  demand for Netflix, and can provide a very simple way to add a Netflix line item to the existing bill, it  may make sense for us to let them bill on our behalf.   We'll take it slowly; we must make sure we've got  the right customer support and financial integration, while maintaining a direct relationship with our  members, to ensure the member experience is actually simpler.  Our Apple TV integration is one  example where we have accomplished that.     Original Programming  When we embarked on original programming, it was a strategic experiment.   We've gained enough  confidence and perspective that we now view it as a strategic expansion.   In particular, we are now  treating it as a capability we should build, like international, to achieve our long-term ambitions.   What  is still uncertain is when or whether we will take it beyond 5% of our large content spend.   We'll take it  year by year, and see how good we can get at originals for our members.     One way to think of originals is in terms of brand halo.   If we are able to generate critical success for our  originals, it will elevate our consumer brand and drive incremental members to the service.   That took  HBO nearly a decade to accomplish, so we don't expect overnight results.  The breadth of media  coverage we already get, though, for the highly anticipated new season of Arrested Development, as  well as for Lilyhammer and House of Cards, has been great.      Another way to think of originals is vertical integration; can we remove enough inefficiency from the  show launch process that we can acquire content more cheaply through licensing shows directly rather  than going through distributors who have already launched a show?  Our on-demand and personalized  platform means that we don't have to assemble a mass audience at say, 8pm on Sunday, to watch the  first episode.  Instead, we can give producers the opportunity to deliver us great serialized shows and  we can cost-efficiently build demand over time, with members discovering these new franchises much  in the same way they've discovered and come to love shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad.  In this  regard, we are happy to report that in terms of cost per viewing hour, which is how we evaluate content      9  efficiency, Lilyhammer so far performs in line with similar premium exclusive content that we  currently license.  Finally, a third way to think about originals is as a hedge, in case, say, FX chooses not to license us prior  seasons of their next hit as good as Sons of Anarchy.  FX in this case would seek to monetize prior  seasons of their next hit in parallel to how HBO does, in other words, only on FX GO.    As long as we  can better monetize prior seasons, through both scale and technology, than anyone else, then this  scenario is not likely, except from a premium TV competitor like HBO that is strategically motivated to  impede our growth.    We know we have a lot to learn in the originals area.   In terms of early results, we exceeded our targets  on Lilyhammer in terms of PR, viewing, and critical acclaim.   The show has driven millions of hours  viewed, is rated highly (4 out of 5 stars on average) and generated hundreds of millions of consumer  impressions with a comparatively small PR and marketing spend. In the quarter, we announced another  original premiering in 2013, Hemlock Grove, a one-hour 13 episode series from Eli Roth and Gaumont  International TV based on Brian McGreevy's gothic horror novel.    As we build our capability in originals, we will have some advantages relative to our competitors.  Namely, we have extensive user viewing history and ratings data to allow us to better understand  potential appeal of future programs, as well as a very broad and already segmented audience. At the  same time, we don't face the same pressure as linear or ad-supported online networks to deliver  ratings. Finally, we should be able to use our size and international scale to bring the best original and  exclusive content from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. This is a real advantage over  our regional competitors.   Global Profitability: Q1 Results & Outlook  Q1 net loss of ($5) million, and ($0.08) per share, was better than our expectations, predominantly  driven by the outperformance in both domestic and international streaming contribution profit, in  addition to slightly lower global Tech & Dev and G&A costs than anticipated.  Looking forward to Q2, sequential growth in domestic streaming contribution profit will offset the  decline in DVD contribution profit from Q1, while improvements in profitability in each of the  international markets will reduce the international losses by approximately $11 million (based on the  midpoint of guidance). As a result, we are forecasting a much earlier return to global profitability than  anticipated on a Q2 net income \/ (loss) range of ($6) to $8 million. The improvement in the outlook is a  result of continued member growth (both domestically and internationally), as well as increased  efficiency of our content and marketing spending.  As described above, looking past Q2 and our expected return to international expansion this year, we  expect to invest the growing profits from our domestic business in additional global expansion in order  to both position ourselves to be the first to scale in each of our international markets, as well as  expedite reaching such global scale that will allow us to license global content rights economically.       10    Free Cash Flow   In Q1, despite our net loss of ($5) million, we generated positive FCF of $2 million. Significant sources of  cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation, depreciation  expense in excess of PP&E purchases, and accrued interest on our notes, which more than offset cash  payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense) and cash payments for taxes relative to the P&L  benefit for income taxes.   In general, FCF and net income track each other reasonably closely with the primary exception of  payments for original content.  Originals will not materially impact free cash flow until the second half of  this year and will ramp in 2013 as we add more original programs.  We finished the quarter with $805 million in cash and equivalents.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: We achieved several milestones in 2021: we had the biggest TV show of the year (Squid Game), our two biggest film releases of all time (Red NoticeandDon't Look Up) and Netflix was the most Emmy-winning and most nominated TV network and the most Oscar-winning and nominated movie studio of 2021. Full year revenue of $30 billion grew 19% year over year while operating income of $6.2 billion rose 35% year over year. We finished Q4 with 222m paid memberships (with 8.3m paid net adds in Q4). Even in a world of uncertainty and increasing competition, we're optimistic about our long-term growth prospects as streaming supplants linear entertainment around the world. We're continually improving Netflix so that we can please our members, grow our share of leisure time and lead in this transition. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Revenue in Q4'21 grew 16% year over year with a 9% increase in average paid memberships. ARM1rose 7% year over year on both a reported and foreign exchange (F\/X) neutral basis, two percentage points faster than Q3'21 (ex-F\/X). Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 8%, a six percentage point decrease vs. the year ago period. The decline in operating margin was expected given our large content slate in Q4 this year. Operating margin was above our beginning of quarter forecast of 6.5% due to slightly lower than forecasted content spend. As a result, our full year operating margin was 21% vs. 18% in 2020, 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1above our 20% guidance forecast. EPS in Q4 of $1.33 vs. $1.19 a year ago included a $104m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We slightly over-forecasted paid net adds in Q4 (8.3m actual compared to the 8.5m paid net adds in both the year ago quarter and our beginning of quarter projection). For the full year 2021, paid net adds totaled 18m vs 37m in 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with more than 90% of our paid net adds in 2021 coming from outside the UCAN region. Nonetheless, our UCAN region added 1.2m paid memberships in Q4'21 (vs. 0.9m last year), marking our strongest quarter of member growth in this region since the early days of COVID-19 in 2020. In APAC, we increased paid memberships by 2.6m (vs. 2.0m in the year ago quarter) with strong growth in both Japan and India. EMEA was our largest contributor to paid net adds in Q4 (3.5m vs. 4.5m in the prior year period) and the region delivered record quarterly revenue, exceeding $2.5 billion for the first time. LATAM paid net adds totaled 1.0m vs. 1.2m last year. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and in others it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net adds performance vs. forecast. For Q1'22, we forecast paid net adds of 2.5m vs. 4.0m in the year ago quarter. Our guidance reflects a more back-end weighted content slate in Q1'22 (for example,BridgertonS2 and our new original film The Adam Projectwill both be launching in March).In addition, while retention and engagement remain healthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels. We think this may be due to several factors including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts of the world like LATAM. 2For 2022, we are currently targeting an operating margin of 19%-20% (assuming no material swings in foreign currency from current levels). Our operating margin outlook is driven by two main factors. First, as seen in the chart below, we delivered above the three percentage point annual linear progression over the past two years (average of four percentage points per year). Second, theUS dollar has strengthened meaningfullyagainst most other currencies. With ~60% of our revenue outside of the US due to our international success, we estimate that the US dollar's appreciation over the past six months has cost us roughly $1 billion in expected 2022 revenue (as a reminder, we don't hedge). With the vast majority of our expenses in US dollars, this translates into an estimated two percentage point negative impact on our 2022 operating margin. As we have written in the past, over the medium term we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. In the near term, we want to continue to invest appropriately in our business and don't want to over-react to F\/X fluctuations to the detriment of our long term growth. There is no change to our goal of steadily growing our operating margin at an average increase of three percentage points per year over any few year period. 3Content Our Q4 content slate epitomizes what we strive for: a wide variety of quality TV series and films. We had a number of big hits in Q4. We released new seasons of returning shows likeThe Witcher(484 million hours viewed2),You(468m hours viewed),Emily inParis(287 million hours viewed) and on December 31, Cobra Kai(274m hours viewed*), as well as the criticallyacclaimed limited seriesMaid(469m hours viewed). The dystopian Korean thrillerSquid Game- a late Q3 release that broke through globally early in Q4 - generated 1.65 billion hours viewed in its first four weeks and is now our biggest TV season ever. The fourth quarter also featured the conclusion to one of our most popular shows -La Casa de Papelaka Money Heist(6.7 billion hours viewed over its lifetime).We're excited to expand theLCDPuniverse with our Korean adaptation,Money Heist: Korea - JointEconomic Area, launching later this year. Over the years, we've learned that big hits can come from anywhere in the world (with great subtitles and dubbing), as we've seen withLa Casa de Papel,Squid Game, andLupinto name just a few. But our goal with non-English originals is to first and foremost thrill audiences in their home country. And in the quarter, we saw big local viewing for titles such asLove is Blind Brazil,My Namefrom Korea, superhero filmMinnal Muralifrom India and Danish thrillerThe Chestnut Man. Film is incredibly important for our members, which is why our ambition has always been to work with the world's best filmmakers and stars to create a wide variety of quality movies. We took a large step forward in Q4 on this front with our biggest film slate ever. Our blockbusterRed Notice(starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds) quickly became our most popular movie launch of all-time with 364 million hours viewed in its first four weeks. Other hits this quarter includeThe Unforgivable,starring 2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through January 18, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 4Sandra Bullock (215m hours viewed), Army of the Dead prequel Army of Thieves (158m hours viewed), feel-good holiday romcom Love Hard with Jimmy O. Yang and Nina Dobrev (134m hours viewed), animated feature Back to the Outback (105m hours viewed) and The Harder They Fall (122m hours viewed). On Christmas Eve, we released the star-studded satire Don't Look Up (featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep), which is already our second most popular film ever with 353m* hours viewed. Overall in 2021, Netflix series accounted for six out of the 10 most searched shows globally while our films represented two of the top 10. Google Year in Search, 2021 (Global) In November we debuted our mobile games experience globally on Android and iOS. Members can now discover and launch games from within the Netflix mobile app. Since launch, we released an additional five games, bringing the total to ten for 2021. It's still very early days but we're pleased with our progress. In 2022, we'll expand our portfolio of games across both casual and core gaming genres as we continue to program a breadth of game types to learn what our members enjoy most. Marketing & Communications One of our goals with marketing is to help drive conversation about and passion for our titles. We know that Netflix fans want to dive deeper into what they watch with behind-the-scenes details, interviews, and updates. To make it easier and more engaging for our fans, we've launched the site Tudum (named after our sonic logo) as a home for extending stories and conversation and further building fandom for our TV shows and films. Product & Pricing Netflix offers a wide variety of TV shows and films to its members, which we know they value. We also work hard to make it easy for members to access this content. For instance, in October, we introduced voice-driven Play Something, first on Amazon Fire TV devices (TVs, sticks, and set top boxes). Now, members can simply say Play Something on Netflix or Play a movie on Netflix and playback will start 5 regardless of whether you are browsing Netflix or another service. If they don't like what's playing, simply saying play something else or next will play the next title in the list. Voice-driven Play Something makes choosing effectively effortless. In December, we lowered our prices in India across all four plans. India is fairly unique because pay TV pricing is very low. We believe these new prices will make Netflix more accessible to a broader swath of the population - strengthening our value perception. Our goal is to maximize long term revenue in each of our markets. Competition Consumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time - competition that has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering. While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth some, we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched. This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition from linear to streaming and that with under 10% of total TV screen time in the US, our biggest market, Netflix has tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$403 million vs. -$138 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was -$569 million vs. -$284 million in Q4'20. For the full year 3 2021, FCF amounted to -$159 million, in-line with our expectation for approximately break-even. We didn't engage in share repurchases in Q4 as we funded our acquisition of the Roald Dahl Story Company from cash on hand during the quarter. We anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We're also targeting $10-$15 billion of gross debt. We finished Q4 with gross debt of $15.5 billion and we'll pay down $700 million of our senior notes due in Q1'22. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) While our current governance structure has served our shareholders extraordinarily well with a sustained period of substantial growth, we've clearly proven our business model: streaming is now an established business, we're self-funding and expect sustained positive free cash flow, and we've substantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margin. So the Netflix Board has decided to evolve to a more standard large-cap governance structure and will recommend several changes at our 3 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6 next annual meeting. These include declassifying our board, removing supermajority voting provisions in our charter and bylaws, and enabling shareholders to call special meetings. We will also change the voting standard for our directors in uncontested elections.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: In Q2, revenue increased 19% year over year to $7.3 billion, while operating income rose 36% year over year to $1.8 billion. We finished the quarter with over 209m paid memberships, slightly ahead of our forecast. COVID has created some lumpiness in our membership growth (higher growth in 2020, slower growth this year), which is working its way through. We continue to focus on improving our service for our members and bringing them the best stories from around the world. Our summary results and forecast for Q3 are below. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Revenue growth was driven by an 11% increase in average paid streaming memberships and 8% growth in average revenue per membership (ARM) . ARM rose 4%, excluding a foreign exchange (FX) impact of 1 +$277m. Operating margin of 25.2% expanded 3 percentage points compared with the year ago quarter. EPS of $2.97 vs. $1.59 a year ago included a $63m non-cash unrealized loss from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The pandemic has created unusual choppiness in our growth and distorts year-over-year comparisons as acquisition and engagement per member household spiked in the early months of COVID. In Q2'21, our engagement per member household was, as expected, down vs. those unprecedented levels but was still up 17% compared with a more comparable Q2'19. Similarly, retention continues to be strong and better than pre-COVID Q2'19 levels, even as average revenue per membership has grown 8% over this two-year 1 Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 period, demonstrating how much our members value Netflix and that as we improve our service we can charge a bit more. We added 1.5m paid memberships in Q2, slightly ahead of our 1.0m guidance forecast. The APAC region represented about two-thirds of our global paid net adds in the quarter. As expected, Q2 paid memberships in the UCAN region were slightly down sequentially (-0.4m paid net adds). We believe our large membership base in UCAN coupled with a seasonally smaller quarter for acquisition is the main reason for this dynamic. This is similar to what we experienced in Q2'19 when our UCAN paid net adds were -0.1m; since then we've added nearly 7.5m paid net adds in UCAN. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q3'21, we forecast paid net additions of 3.5m vs. 2.2m in the prior year period. If we achieve our forecast, we will have added more than 54m paid net adds over the past 24 months or 27m on an annualized basis over that time period, which is consistent with our pre-COVID annual rate of net additions. We forecast that ARM will grow roughly 5% year over year on a FX neutral basis in Q3'21. We continue to target a 20% operating margin for the full year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. After our big global launch in January 2016, we committed to steadily growing our operating margin thereafter at an average rate of three percentage points per year over any few-year period. Some years we'll be a little over (like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021). Assuming we achieve our margin target this year, we will have quintupled our operating margin in the last five years and are tracking ahead of this average annual three percentage point pace. 2 With revenue and margin both increasing, our operating profit dollars have risen dramatically as well (even as we have been investing heavily), from about $100 million per quarter in 2016 to nearly $2 billion per quarter so far in 2021. Our belief is that as we steadily improve our service to better please our members, this will lead to continued growth in our membership base, ARM, revenue, operating margin and profit dollars. Content We launched our first original scripted TV series in 2012 and we've since expanded our original programming effort to many additional categories, from all over the world. Our goal is to be everyone's first choice for entertainment because of the variety and quality of our titles. And despite the COVID-related production delays in 2020, we were able to deliver an exciting portfolio of titles in Q2'21 that exemplify this ambition. For example, Shadow and Bone, a fantasy series based on the popular Grishaverse book series, proved to be very popular with our members. Over 55m member households chose to watch this show in its first 28 days and we've renewed it for a second season. Sweet Tooth, based on the beloved DC comic, was another hit series with 60m member households choosing this title in its first four weeks. Our expansion into non-fiction series is going well. This past quarter, standout unscripted titles include season two of dating show Too Hot to Handle and social experiment reality program The Circle (an estimated 29m and 14m, respectively, chose to watch in the first 28 days) as well as the true crime docu-series The Sons of Sam (19m). We're building out some of these unscripted titles with local versions of the same formats. As one example, Too Hot to Handle: Brazil and Too Hot to Handle: Latino will be launching later in July and September, respectively, to serve our LATAM region. 3 We're also quickly growing both our live action and animated original film offering, with several impactful titles in Q2. Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead was a blockbuster as 75m member households chose to watch this action packed zombie spectacle in its first 28 days of release. As an extension to Army of the Dead, a prequel, Army of Thieves, will be released in Q4'21 along with a spinoff anime series later in 2022. Fatherhood, a dramedy starring Kevin Hart, was another hit, drawing an estimated 74m member households in its first 28 days. And Q2 also featured our biggest Netflix animated film to date with 53m member households choosing to watch The Mitchells vs. The Machines. Last week, Netflix series and specials received 129 Emmy nominations. With 24 nominations, The Crown tied for the most nominated series. Bridgerton with 12 nominations was also nominated for Best Drama series while The Queen's Gambit received 18 nominations including Best Limited Series. Cobra Kai, Emily In Paris and the finale season of The Kominsky Method were all nominated for Best Comedy series. Beyond this acclaim, these are also among our popular series on Netflix. Our non-English content investments are growing both in scope and impact. Our P&L content expense for this content category has more than doubled in the past two years. Illustrating how great stories can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere, part two of Lupin from France was our largest non-English title in the quarter with 54m member households choosing this title in its first four weeks. Season four of Elite from Spain drew 37m member households in its first 28 days, while season two of Who Killed Sara? built on the success of the first season with 34m households choosing the latest installment of this gripping thriller from Mexico. As discussed in previous letters, COVID-related production delays in 2020 have led to a lighter first half of 2021 slate that will build through the course of the year. In the first six months of 2021, content amortization grew only 9% year over year (as compared to 17% in FY20). COVID and its variants make predicting the future hard, but with productions largely running smoothly so far, we're optimistic in our ability to deliver a strong second half slate. Through the first half of 2021 we've already spent $8 billion in cash on content (up 41% yr-over-yr and 1.4x our content amortization) and we expect content amortization to be around $12 billion for the full year (+12% year over year). Our Q3 slate will include new seasons of fan favorites La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), Sex Education, Virgin River and Never Have I Ever as well as live action films including Sweet Girl (starring Jason Momoa), Kissing Booth 3, and Kate (starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the animated feature film Vivo, featuring all-new songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda. We're also in the early stages of further expanding into games, building on our earlier efforts around interactivity (eg, Black Mirror Bandersnatch) and our Stranger Things games. We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV. Games will be included in members' Netflix subscription at no additional cost similar to films and series. Initially, we'll be primarily focused on games for mobile devices. We're excited as ever about our movies and TV series offering and we expect a long runway of increasing investment and growth across all of our existing content categories, but since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games. Product 4 We're constantly innovating across a broad range of areas to improve the viewing experience and better serve our members. That's why this quarter we globally launched Play Something on television, our new feature that lets Netflix do the work when you don't feel like choosing what to watch. Recognizing that broadband quality and cost varies around the world, we also improved the Netflix download experience to enable you to start watching a show or film even if it hasn't finished downloading. Once you reconnect, you can complete the partial download and keep watching — also helping members avoid exceeding their data limits. We recently expanded our low-cost mobile-only plan to an additional 78 countries across South East Asia and sub-saharan Africa. Like in our other markets, this plan complements our existing three tiers of service. In the five markets where we had previously launched a mobile-only plan, we have found that the mobile only plan has been an effective way to introduce more consumers to Netflix while being roughly revenue neutral as the lower average revenue per membership is offset by incremental acquisition and generally better retention. Competition We are still very much in the early days of the transition from linear to on-demand consumption of entertainment. Streaming represents just 27% of US TV screen time, compared with 63% for linear television, according to Nielsen. Based on this same study, Nielsen estimates that we are just 7% of US TV screen time. Considering that we are less mature in other countries and that this excludes mobile screens (where we believe our share of engagement is even lower), we are confident that we have a long runway for growth. As we improve our service, our goal is to continue to increase our share of screen time in the US and around the world. 5 Share of Total US TV Time, June 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) The planned combination of Warner Media Group and Discovery and Amazon's pending acquisition of MGM are examples of the ongoing industry consolidation as firms adapt to a world where streaming supplants linear TV. The industry has consolidated materially over the years (Time Warner\/AT&T, Viacom\/CBS, Discovery\/Scripps, Disney\/Fox, Comcast\/NBCU\/Sky, etc.) and we don't believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if at all. While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don't view any assets as must-have and we haven't yet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon. In the race to entertain consumers around the world, we continue to compete for screen time with a broad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok (to name just a few). But, we are mostly competing with ourselves to improve our service as fast as we can. If we can do that, we're confident we can maintain our strong position and continue to grow nicely as we have been over the past two-plus decades. Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q2, net cash generated by operating activities was -$64 million vs. $1 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was -$175 million vs. $899 million in Q2'20. FCF in last year's 2 Q2 benefited from COVID-related production shutdowns. We are still expecting full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately break even. As we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6 During Q2, we increased our revolving credit facility (which remains undrawn) to $1 billion from $750 million and extended the maturity from 2024 to 2026. We also repurchased 1m shares for $500 million (at an average per share price of about $500) under our $5 billion share authorization. Our main priority is to invest in the organic growth of our business while maintaining strong liquidity and retaining financial flexibility for strategic investments. Our growing operating profit allows us to complement this priority with a return of capital to shareholders. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In June, the independent sustainability think tank The Carbon Trust published a white paper examining the carbon impact of video streaming. Key findings of the work include:  The average carbon footprint for Europe per hour of video streaming is approximately 55gCO2e, equivalent to driving 250 metres in an average petrol car.  Devices (TVs, laptops\/PCs, smartphones, tablets) make up the largest portion of carbon emissions from streaming (over 50%), compared to other components like energy from data centers or networks. Good news: Devices are getting more efficient over time and total device usage is fairly constant (with Netflix gaining share from linear).  Changing resolutions and other viewing settings were found to result in only a very small change in the carbon impact. Changing from standard definition to 4K resolution grows transmission emissions from just under 1g CO2e\/hour to just over 1g CO2e\/hour.  As demand for streaming and other internet services increases, the carbon intensity of these services will decrease over time. This is due to (1) networking equipment becoming less energy-intensive with technological advances, and (2) increased use of renewable electricity.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Q2 was better-than-expected on membership growth, and foreign exchange was worse-than-expected (stronger US dollar), resulting in 9% revenue growth (13% constant currency). Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product, content, and marketing as we've done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience. We're in a position of strength given our $30 billion-plus in revenue, $6 billion in operating profit last year, growing free cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q2 Results Revenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year (or 13% excluding a -$339 million foreign currency impact), driven by a 6% and 2% increase in average paid memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F\/X), ARM rose 7% year over year. The appreciation of the US dollar (USD) vs. most other currencies since our April earnings report was the primary reason for the variance to our revenue guidance forecast. We slightly under-forecasted global paid net adds in Q2 (-1.0m vs. -2.0m forecast and compared to +1.5m in the year ago quarter).  In APAC, revenue grew 23% year over year, excluding F\/X. At over $900 million of revenue, APAC is approaching the size of our LATAM business. We added 1.1m paid memberships in the region (vs. 1.0m last Q2). ARM in APAC was -2% year over year on a F\/X neutral basis, due to the impact from our price decrease in India last December as well as plan mix, which was partially offset by 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1higher ARM in Korea and Australia. Excluding India, APAC ARM grew 4% year over year on a constant currency basis.  Excluding F\/X, EMEA revenue and ARM increased 13% and 6% year over year, respectively, while paid net additions totaled -0.8m vs. 0.2m in the year ago quarter.  Revenue in LATAM grew 19% year over year excluding F\/X and surpassed the $1 billion quarterly mark for the first time, helped by constant currency ARM growth of 15%. Paid memberships were flat sequentially (compared to 0.8m paid net adds in Q2'21).  In UCAN, ARM and revenue each increased 10% year over year, excluding the impact of F\/X. Paid net adds were -1.3m vs. -0.4m in the year ago period. Retention improved over the course of the quarter and, while churn remains slightly elevated, it is now back near pre-price change levels. We've adjusted our cost structure for our current rate of revenue growth. This resulted in approximately $70 million of severance costs and an $80m non-cash impairment of certain real estate leases primarily related to rightsizing our office footprint. Excluding these items totaling $150 million, and the F\/X impact of the stronger US dollar since our April report, operating profit and operating margin were slightly ahead of our guidance forecast. EPS of $3.20 vs. $2.97 a year ago exceeded our guidance forecast of $3.00 due to a $305 million non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in interest and other income. Our approximately $5 billion of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge against the Euro for net income, but doesn't affect operating income. Year to date, our gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro debt is $467 million. Q3 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the current uncertain macro-economic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. The US dollar continues to strengthen meaningfully against most currencies at ahistoric pace, withthe Euro recently falling below the US dollarfor thefirst time in two decades, a significant headwind for all multinational US companies. We have high exposure to this unprecedented appreciation in the USD because nearly 60% of our revenue comes from outside the US and swings in F\/X have a large flow through to operating profit as most of our expenses are in USD and don't benefit from a stronger USD. Our Q3 revenue growth forecast of 5% translates into 12% year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Similarly, excluding the impact of currency, operating profit growth would be -3% year over year (vs our forecast decline of -29%) and operating margin would be 20% (vs our forecast of 16%). As we have written in the past, over the medium term, we intend to continue to adjust our business as appropriate given the relative strength of the USD to protect our operating margin and try to avoid immediate actions that we believe could be detrimental to the business. We forecast paid net adds for Q3 of +1.0m vs. 4.4m in the year ago quarter. We continue to expect full year 2022 operating margin of 19%-20%, excluding the unanticipated $150m of restructuring costs in Q2 2noted above and the material movement in F\/X from January 2022, as our guidance was set based on F\/X at that time (see our Q4'21 letter). Content, Marketing, and Product Last quarter, we discussed our slowing revenue growth, which we believe is the result of connected TV adoption, account sharing, competition, and macro factors such as sluggish economic growth and the impacts of the war in Ukraine. We've now had more time to understand these issues, as well as how best to address them. First and foremost, we need to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix. This focus on improving our core service has served us well over the past 25 years, and remains our north star to drive continuous growth. It's why we strive for an ever better content, marketing and product experience. Also as a pure play streaming business, we're unencumbered by legacy revenue streams. This freedom means we can offer big movies direct-to-Netflix, without the need for extended or exclusive theatrical windows, and let members binge watch TV if they want, without having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. This focus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believe to be a significant long term business advantage. Our content offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of member tastes by providing an unmatched variety and quality of titles. Our Q2 slate is emblematic of this approach, headlined by season four of Stranger Things, which returned to tremendous fan reception and was a smash hit by all measures - including an outstanding drama Emmy nomination (along with Ozark season 4 and Squid Game). In its first four weeks, Stranger Things season four generated 1.3 billion hours viewed , making it our biggest 2 season of English TV ever. Season four also re-ignited interest in past episodes with season one through three experiencing a greater than five-fold increase in viewing in the month after the release of season four (vs. the prior month). Season four of Stranger Things also showcased the effectiveness of our marketing strategy in driving conversation around our titles. When we deliver shows and movies that members are talking about in large numbers, we can influence pop culture, build passion for Netflix and create an experience that is differentiated and difficult-to-replicate. For example, the show catapulted the 1985 song Running Up That Hill to the top of the music charts. Metallica also enjoyed a return to the charts in the US and UK with their 1986 song Master of Puppets after being featured in the new season of Stranger Things. The cumulative Twitter volume for Stranger Things continues to outpace both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Top Gun Maverick, highlighting the big conversation around this title and reinforcing that our binge versus one week at a time release strategy drives lots of water cooler conversation. 2 Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release for each title; since some titles have multiple premiere dates, whether weekly or in parts, we count the 28 days from each episode premiere date in each country. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 17, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed at Netflix Top 10. 3 We also delivered a wide variety of other English language series hits in Q2, including season three of The Umbrella Academy (284m view hours*) and season one of The Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama, which generated 277m hours viewed and has been renewed for a second season. We've also renewed the endearing, UK-produced young adult drama Heartstopper (67m view hours) for another two seasons. In unscripted, audiences embraced season five of Selling Sunset, which recorded 95m view hours in its first four weeks, while the debut season of marriage reality show The Ultimatum had 148m view hours. In unscripted, we are also taking global formats and creating local versions. This quarter, we had Rhythm + Flow France, our rap competition show, which was a big local success. The winner of season one, Fresh, was formerly unknown, working in a gym. But since his appearance on the show, he has become a star with his song CHOP that he performed in the finale hitting #1 on every streaming service in France. He was also invited to the Les Ardentes music festival where he performed for an audience of 15,000 people - another example of \"The Netflix Effect.\" We're making good progress in film. The basketball drama Hustle (starring Adam Sandler) was our biggest Netflix movie in Q2 (186m hours viewed) and was loved by critics and audiences alike, followed by the comedy Senior Year, starring Rebel Wilson, with 161m view hours. We continue to invest in animated features; building off our initial titles like Over the Moon and Back to the Outback, we released The Sea Beast (102m hours viewed*) early in Q3 to audience and critical acclaim. Today, we announced that we will be acquiring leading animation studio Animal Logic, with ~800 amazing people mostly in Sydney and Vancouver, which will help us accelerate the development of our animation production capabilities and reinforces our commitment to build a world-class animation studio. We've been partnering with Animal Logic for two years now, working on The Magician's Elephant (directed by Wendy Rogers) and the recently announced The Shrinking of the Treehorns (directed by Ron Howard). Together, we'll create an animation studio that will produce some of our largest animated 4 feature films. We'll fund the purchase from our existing cash balance. The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals and we anticipate closing later this year. We're building on our lead in non-English programming. We want Netflix to be relevant to audiences all over the globe and our local language titles are a differentiator for us. We focus first on telling authentic stories for local impact, but we see that great stories can travel everywhere. Another example of this In Q2 was The Marked Heart, a Colombian series, which found a global audience and ended up in the top 10 in 81 countries around the world by its second week.  Similarly, The Takedown, a French film, was in the top 10 in 91 countries around the world by its second week, again showing the power of an authentic story and our ability to serve those stories - with subtitling, dubbing, and personalized discovery - for members to enjoy around the world. While we always have room to improve, we're very pleased with how far we've come in providing so much satisfaction and enjoyment to our members. For instance, in the US, which is one of the most competitive markets in the world, we drew more TV viewing time than any other outlet during the 2021-22 TV season (see chart below), nearly matching the combined total of the two most watched broadcast networks. And, as Nielsen will announce on Thursday, our share of US TV viewing reached an all-time high of 7.7% in June (vs. 6.6% in June 2021), demonstrating our ability to grow our engagement share as we continue to improve our service. Since our launch of a small selection of licensed mobile games last November, we've released new games every few weeks, with the portfolio growing to the current total of 24. The games are all intended to be accessible to broad audiences, and span several genres and categories, including racing with Asphalt Xtreme, the digital version of the irreverent card game Exploding Kittens, zombies in Into the Dead 2 and the knitting for cats in Knittens. We've had millions of our members play games through the service and we are learning about what games work for different audiences. We're adapting our 5 licensing and partner-based development activities in response to these learnings. We've also acquired three games studios (Night School Studios, Boss Fight Studios, and Next Games) which gives us a range of expertise in multiple geographies to accelerate the buildout of our internal development capacity. We are building a solid pipeline of new games that will launch over the next several years and are excited to see our members engage with these titles. Near Term Focus In the near term, a key priority to re-accelerate revenue growth is to evolve and improve our monetization. In the early days of streaming, we kept our pricing very simple with just one plan level. In 2014, we introduced three price tiers to better segment demand. Going forward, we will focus on better monetizing usage through both continued optimization of our pricing and tiering structures as well as the addition of a new, lower-priced ad-supported tier. Advertising Our lower priced advertising-supported offering will complement our existing plans, which will remain ad-free. Our global ARM has grown at a 5% compound annual rate from 2013 to 2021, so it makes sense now to give consumers a choice for a lower priced option with advertisements, if they desire it. We recently announced Microsoft as our technology and sales partner and we're targeting to launch this tier around the early part of 2023. They are investing heavily to expand their multi-billion advertising business into premium television video, and we are thrilled to be working with such a strong global partner. We're excited by the opportunity given the combination of our very engaged audience and high quality content, which we think will attract premium CPMs from brand advertisers. We'll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant. Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So, our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one. Over time, our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that's more seamless and relevant for consumers, and more effective for our advertising partners. While it will take some time to grow our member base for the ad tier and the associated ad revenues, over the long run, we think advertising can enable substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth (through ad revenues). Paid Sharing We're in the early stages of working to monetize the 100m+ households that are currently enjoying, but not directly paying for, Netflix. We know this will be a change for our members. As such, we have launched two different approaches in Latin America to learn more. Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023. We're encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America. 6 Simplicity At Netflix, focus remains very important to us. These initiatives - paid sharing and advertising - do introduce some additional complexity, but our approach has always been to keep our business model as simple as possible within the context of our growth objectives. In this vein, these initiatives are similar to expanding into originals, launching our service across the world, and building our own studio, each of which also increased complexity but are natural extensions intended to enhance our existing business. F\/X Neutral Operating Margin Disclosure To provide additional transparency around our operating margin, we'll now disclose our year-to-date (YTD) operating margin based on F\/X rates at the beginning of each year.  This will allow investors to see how our operating margin is tracking against our target (which was set in January of 2022 based on F\/X rates at that time), absent intra-year fluctuations in F\/X (which have been substantial in 2022). As can be seen from the table below, F\/X-driven changes to our revenue have a high flow through to operating income (the operating profit impact ranges from ~75% to 80%+ of the revenue impact). This is because the bulk of our expenses don't change with F\/X fluctuations. * Based on F\/X rates at the beginning of each year. YTD 2022 through June 30, 2022. Note: There were no adjustments to content amortization for the purposes of this calculation, as titles are amortized at the historical blended rate at the time of capitalization. 7 Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was +$103 million vs. -$64 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) in the quarter totaled +$13 million, compared with  -$175 million in Q2'21. 3 Cash declined $190m sequentially, primarily due to our Next Games acquisition ($69m) and the F\/X impact on cash ($145m). As we've discussed previously, we are now self-funding. For the full year 2022, we expect FCF to be approximately +$1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars (assuming no material further movements in F\/X). We expect annual positive FCF going forward (with substantial growth in FCF in 2023 vs. 2022) due to our increasing revenue, solid profitability, and the successful multi-year evolution of our content model. We're now more than a decade into transforming our service from licensed second run content to mostly Netflix originals - including more than five years into building out our internal studio to produce the majority of our original titles (60% of our net content assets on our balance sheet are Netflix-produced). We're now through the most cash-intensive part of that transition. As a result, our cash content spend-to-content amortization expense ratio peaked at 1.6x (along with peak negative FCF of -$3.3B in 2019) and is expected to be about 1.2-1.3x in 2022 and to decline going forward, based on our current plans, which assume no material expansion into new content categories in '23. 2022 estimate based on the midpoint of 1.2x-1.3x range. 3 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 8 Gross debt at quarter end amounted to $14.3 billion, within our targeted range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $5.8 billion, net debt totaled $8.5 billion, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA . Our capital structure policy 4 remains unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (eg, about $5.3 billion based on Q2 revenue). After meeting those needs, our intent is to return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) At this year's annual meeting in June, shareholders approved proposals to declassify our board, remove supermajority voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings. We've also changed the voting standard for our directors to simple majority in uncontested elections. Our governance structure is now similar to other large cap company governance structures. With more than one billion people living with some form of disability, we want to ensure Netflix is as accessible as possible. In Q2, we announced that we are expanding the availability of audio descriptions and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing to a total of 20 languages - work that recently won the prestigious Dr. Jacob Bolotin Award. We've also introduced new badges for our titles that have audio descriptions and subtitles on laptop and iOS, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first. Summary Reaccelerating our revenue growth is a big challenge. But we've been through hard times before. We've built this company to be flexible and adaptable and this will be a great test for us and our high performance culture. We're fortunate to be in a position of strength as the leader in streaming entertainment by all metrics (revenue, engagement, subscribers, profit and free cash flow). We're confident and optimistic about the future.

Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F\/X neutral operating margin allows investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currency fluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

Our holiday season was particularly strong, driven by consumers buying new electronic devices, including tablets and smart TVs. Both voluntary and involuntary retention improved in Q4. The increase in involuntary retention was due to improvements in how we process payments and recover those members on payment hold. We believe the gains in voluntary retention stemmed from steady improvements in service and content relative to the broad array of video choices available to consumers, as shown by the continued growth in our median hours viewed per member. Contribution margin continued to climb in Q4, expanding sequentially 210 basis points to 18.5%. Our outperformance relative to our target of 100 basis points of margin expansion per quarter was driven by higher than forecasted members and revenue and lower than forecasted content delivery costs. Starting this quarter, you'll see that we expanded our segment disclosures to break out marketing and cost of revenues. We've been investing in making our service better with increased spending on content, which helps both retain and attract members, and have been able to trim marketing spending yet maintain strong net additions. Our target remains to expand contribution margin on average about 100 basis points per quarter. We anticipate domestic streaming contribution profit will, for the first time ever, be larger than DVD contribution profit (and up about 90% year over year) in Q1. Regarding domestic streaming content, we announced in Q4 that we will be the exclusive Pay 1 home for theatrical releases from the Walt Disney Studio starting in 2016. While we've done similar major studio Pay 1 deals before (e.g. Paramount in Canada, Warner Bros. in the Nordics, and Lionsgate in the U.K. and Ireland), and will do more in the future, the Disney deal is particularly significant because it is our first Pay 1 deal with a major studio in the U.S. and because of the strength of the Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm titles. 2016 is a long way off, and in the meantime, we are adding lots of other great films and TV shows, including a wide assortment of family films from the Disney catalog. More recently, we signed a deal with Warner Bros., the largest TV producer in the world, bringing exclusively to Netflix complete previous seasons of popular on-air serialized dramas such as Revolution on NBC and The Following on Fox. This deal is significant because we are licensing directly from the producer, rather than the networks on which these shows air, allowing us to bring previous seasons to Netflix earlier than traditional network deals have accommodated. This type of license agreement plays right to our sweet spot. When it comes to highly serialized TV series, Netflix 2offers an amazingly better experience than any other alternative as members can start right from season one, episode one and watch episodes how and when they feel like it. In terms of domestic competition, TV Everywhere, including HBO GO, continues to improve, and linear TV distributors clearly see the benefit of offering Internet TV. This competition for viewing time will increase over the next several years, as we have long predicted, as consumers come to expect Internet TV on demand viewing for all their video entertainment. More narrowly, Amazon Prime, Redbox Instant, and Hulu also offer low-cost streaming offerings, and they have some of the same content that Netflix has, as well as some unique content. The more unique content they have (for example, Battleground and Community on Hulu, or Falling Skies and The Closer on Amazon Prime), the more they are a different service than ours. To the degree they have some of the same content as Netflix, they are potentially a substitute for Netflix. To examine this, we looked at the top 200 titles on Netflix: our 100 most popular movies and our 100 most popular TV shows in Q4. Of these 200, 113 are not on Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus or Redbox Instant. Of the 87 that are available on at least one of these services, Hulu Plus offers 27 of the 200; Amazon Prime 73 of the 200; and Redbox Instant 12 of the 200, with significant overlap in TV between Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime, and in movies between Amazon Prime and Redbox Instant. In other words, when it comes to the most popular content with members on Netflix, none of these services are good substitutes to Netflix. 3Like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu are moving towards increasing exclusives and original series, and over time as a group we are likely to compete more like Showtime and HBO do today. In the U.K. this is already the case: Sky NOW TV, LOVEFiLM, and Netflix have very limited overlapping content. The same holds true in the Nordics among the various services. In such a world, our originals will be a great asset. When it comes to competition, we not only have a superior content offering due to our larger budget, but we are further along the experience curve when it comes to improving our user interface and delivering great quality streaming. For all of these reasons, Netflix continues to add members rapidly. Earlier this year, the Video Privacy Protection Act, or VPPA, was modernized and now allows U.S. members to share what they are watching on Netflix with their friends on an ongoing basis. Our members will now be able to choose to have friends rows within the Netflix user interface for friends they have agreed to share viewing with. Our default settings will not auto-post to Facebook timeline, but members will be able to post to Facebook specific titles they are passionate about. We are excited to roll these features out in the U.S. in the next few months. Looking forward, we expect this year's Q1 net additions to be slightly higher than last year's Q1 net additions of 1.7 million. The fact that our growth remains this strong despite intensifying competition, and our already substantial U.S. market penetration, underlines the large opportunity ahead. As a reminder, we detailed in our April 2012 Investor Letter how unchanged seasonality of gross adds would, due to the larger size of our existing subscriber base, result in increased seasonality of net additions. Thus we would expect fewer net additions in Q2 2013 than in Q2 2012, because Q2 is our seasonally lightest quarter. That said, we anticipate the fourth season of Arrested Development to debut in Q2, and that could bring us higher than otherwise expected membership. International During the quarter, we grew to over 6 million international members, as people around the world discover the benefits of Netflix. Our total international contribution loss of $105 million in Q4 was, as expected, higher than the prior quarter international loss of $92 million, owing to the incremental costs associated with our launch in the Nordic countries. The Q4 loss was lower, however, than our guidance midpoint of a $113 million loss, due primarily to the higher than expected growth of international subscriptions and revenue. Over the course of this year, we expect to see declining losses in our current international markets as member growth exceeds growth in content spending. With a Q1 guidance midpoint of $87 million in international losses, we expect a sequential improvement of $18 million, with more modest sequential improvements expected in subsequent quarters. 4                       5      For the first half of 2013, we aren't planning to launch additional international markets. We are  evaluating several expansion markets for late 2013 or 2014, but have not made any decisions yet. Our  launch in the Nordics was very successful, confirming our belief in the large international opportunity for  our service.    In Latin America, we've made steady progress on our consumer payment infrastructure.  In Brazil, we've  recently launched a direct debit consumer payment option with several major banks (Débito  Automático) and are testing the uniquely Brazilian form of payments known as Boleto Bancário. In  Mexico, we've made progress in enabling debit cards for Netflix which has to be done in some cases  bank-by-bank. Over 50 million households pay for residential broadband in Latin America, over half the  U.S. number, so this region is a massive opportunity for us.    In Q4, the 2012 hit film The Hunger Games debuted on our Canadian service, with much success, just  as it had a few months prior on our Latin America service.  In Q1, it will debut on our U.K. and Ireland  services, followed by the U.S. The multi-territorial success of The Hunger Games on Netflix shows the  value that an international programming platform like Netflix offers content brands, and underlines how  such broad international reach remains unique.    In addition to competition from local broadcasters and distributors with TV Everywhere-type products,  and from piracy, we face many pure-play competitors around the world, including Clarovideo, Sky NOW  TV, HBO Nordics, Amazon LOVEFiLM, Viaplay, and others.  Our estimates from Internet data flows and  other sources suggest we lead all of them in both viewing and revenue. We have a large and growing  membership base to invest against, and our R&D effort is more substantial than our competitors,  allowing us to provide a better and faster-evolving user experience that gives members the ability to  find great series and films to watch, no matter the territory.    Given this heightened competition, we'll say a little less about country by country results than in the  past, to avoid inadvertently helping our competitors.  Long-term international success for Netflix is  consumer adoption and contribution margins at the levels of our domestic market.  Progress towards  that can be seen quarterly in our growing international membership and declining international losses.    Original Series    We believe that February 1st will be a defining moment in the development of Internet TV.     On that day, we will release all 13 episodes of House of Cards in all of our markets, allowing our  members the freedom to immerse themselves when and how they want in the world created by David  Fincher and his stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright.                           6      Imagine if books were always released one chapter per week, and were only briefly available to read at  8pm on Thursday.  And then someone flipped a switch, suddenly allowing people to enjoy an entire  book, all at their own pace. That is the change we are bringing about. That is the future of television.   That is Internet TV.     Stepping back, we have three major types of streaming content on Netflix:  1. Movies from one to fifty years old  2. Prior seasons of current TV shows and complete prior season of off-air TV shows  3. Original series only available on Netflix.     The first category, movies, is where we started.  Then, over the last few years, we've greatly expanded  our offering in the second category, prior-season TV, with a particular emphasis on serialized drama.  Such shows were struggling to find a consistent economic return on linear TV, whereas for us they work  great, playing directly into the way that people actually prefer to watch such shows.     Original series are a third type of content to attract and retain members.  Because original series can be  completely exclusive to Netflix (no TVOD, no linear, no kiosks, no theaters) we believe they will be more  effective in attracting and retaining members than equivalent content that is less exclusive to Netflix.       We believe original series developed for Internet TV will be better for creators, better for consumers,  and better for Netflix.  A large on-demand service has fundamental advantages in producing and  launching new series.     Linear channels must aggregate a large audience at a given time of day and hope the show programmed  will actually attract enough viewers despite this constraint.  With Netflix, members can enjoy a show  anytime, and over time, we can effectively put the right show in front of members based on their  viewing habits.  Thus we can spend less on marketing while generating higher viewership.     For linear TV, the fixed number of prime-time slots mean that only shows that hit it big and fast survive,  thus requiring an extensive and expensive pilot system to keep on deck potential replacement shows. In  contrast, Internet TV is an environment where smaller or quirkier shows can prosper because they can  find a big enough audience over time. In baseball terms, linear TV only scores with home runs.  We score  with home runs too, but also with singles, doubles and triples.      Because of our unique strengths, we can commit to producing and publishing books rather than  chapters, so the creators can concentrate on multi-episode story arcs, rather than pilots.  Creators can  work on episode 11 confident that viewers have recently enjoyed episodes 1 to 10.   Creators can  develop episodes that are not all exactly 22 or 44 minutes in length.  The constraints of the linear TV grid  will fall, one by one.                            7      For viewers, Internet TV is a better experience because of the freedom and flexibility it provides, and in  the case of Netflix, the lack of commercials.  In addition, by releasing our shows on the same day across  all of our markets, we will delight international members, as usually, they have to wait months after a  U.S. premiere to enjoy the same content.      House of Cards will be followed by Eli Roth's Hemlock Grove (a horror thriller) on April 19th, the  much anticipated fourth season of Arrested Development in May, Orange is the New Black (a prison  dramedy from Weeds creator Jenji Kohan), Derek with Ricky Gervais, and lastly this year, season two  of Lilyhammer.    If we are successful with our originals, we will produce content with comparable cost per viewing hour  to other exclusive premium content. Success with originals will also enhance the global reputation of  Netflix as a source of unique must-view content.          While our first slate of originals will represent a small percentage of both our content budget (i.e. P&L  expense) and total viewing hours this year, the cash is front loaded relative to the P&L expense.  In Q4,  our current originals became a material use of cash for the first time.  They are expected to consume  more cash in Q1 and then decrease in terms of cash use in Q2 forward.  More on this topic below in the  FCF section.  Programming Great Content    Our content budget has grown rapidly over the last few years, allowing us to greatly expand the scope of  the Netflix offering. With every title we add to the library, we remain focused on our goal of being an  expert programmer, licensing an overall mix of content that delights our members, rather than trying to  be a very broad content distributor.     A distributor aggregates and provides access to wide swaths of content, but usually on a non-exclusive  and undifferentiated basis.  Comcast and DIRECTV are distributors.    A programmer takes an active role in creating a curated content offering, providing selective and often  exclusive content that is differentiated from other programmers.  HBO and Netflix are programmers.     As a programmer, we seek to offer our members high quality and high engagement premium content  choices. To do so, we have increasingly licensed content on an exclusive basis to ensure our members  are receiving an entertainment experience that cannot be replicated by our competitors.    Coincidently, this means we are selective about what titles we add to the service and what content  agreements we renew. Since we can't license everything and also maintain low prices, we seek out  content that delivers the highest member engagement relative to its cost. This also means that we'll                         8      forego or not renew content that doesn't optimize for engagement and cost efficiency across the  available content choices within the constraints of our budget. This was the case when we did not renew  our Starz agreement in 2011, as well as our A&E \/ History Channel agreement last year. In all cases, we  use our extensive member viewing data to inform our programming choices to create a unique and  compelling offering that will most delight our members.    As part of our selective programming strategy, we focus not only on major studio output, but also on  providing our members with interesting and compelling independent content. Because of our  merchandising capabilities as well as our massive member base, we enjoy high engagement on what  would otherwise be considered non-mainstream content. For example, we currently stream three of the  2013 Oscar nominated documentary feature films on Netflix: 5 Broken Cameras, The Invisible War,  and How To Survive a Plague.  In addition, many of the top independent films of the year can only be  found on Netflix.   Improving Member Streaming Experience    We are focused on creating an experience that delights our members and increases their engagement.  Our large member base allows us to do more and bigger experiments, which enables us to learn what  works best for our members more quickly than our competitors.    We recently launched Netflix on Windows 8 with a great user interface that works for both  mouse\/keyboard and touch screen, and we launched Netflix on the Wii U with a second screen  experience for choosing what to watch. We are also pioneering the use of tablets and handsets as  second-screen choosing devices for TV viewing.    As part of the Netflix search experience, we have made it even easier for members to explore our vast  catalog and we'll continue working on improving the algorithms that power our recommendations, as  well as making search more effective for our members.  Another way we're now leveraging our  recommendations system is to identify the audience most likely to enjoy each Netflix Original from our  diverse upcoming slate.  Unlike linear television that needs to build an audience for the premiere  showing, our tools are designed to maximize the value of each show over the long term.  We'll learn the  characteristics of the members who love each show and promote to potential viewers with similar traits.    To make our suggestions more useful, we have recently started testing several variations of a personal  profiles feature that creates suggestions for different members of the household based on their own  taste, not confused by the viewing of their kids or others sharing the same subscription.  If this test  succeeds in increasing member engagement, we will roll out profiles more broadly later this year.    Last year, Netflix launched Open Connect to enable ISPs to receive Netflix media data directly, and for  free, at various standard interconnection points or within their own networks.  This is more efficient                         9      than going through intermediaries, and provides consumers with the highest quality picture and least  rebuffering. Most international ISPs and many domestic ISPs already receive their traffic via Open  Connect.  Our newest and best video formats (Super-HD and 3D) that are larger and more challenging to  deliver are only available on Open Connect.  We are working hard to get all ISPs to directly connect for  free to Open Connect to improve their customers' broadband experience.    DVD    DVD memberships declined less than we had anticipated this quarter to 8.2 million (above the top end  of our guidance range), driven by stronger than forecasted retention.  The decline has slowed in each  quarter since we introduced the DVD-only plan.     The domestic DVD segment delivered $128 million of contribution profit in Q4, representing a 50%  contribution margin, higher than anticipated due to higher members and lower than expected DVD  usage.  We anticipate a decline in DVD contribution margin sequentially from Q4 to Q1 as usage  seasonally increases in Q1 and the expected USPS rate increase of $0.01 each way takes effect in  January.    The US Postal Service is under financial stress, but we don't foresee service changes this year that have a  material negative impact upon us or our members.    Global Profitability:  Q4 Results & Q1 Outlook    Consolidated Q4 net income of $8 million ($0.13 EPS) exceeded our guidance due to contribution profit  out-performance primarily in our domestic and international streaming segments. Net income was flat  quarter over quarter, as increased domestic streaming contribution profit (up $18 million) more than  offset a $3 million decline of DVD contribution profit, and a $12 million increase in international losses  (driven by the launch of the Nordics market), while global operating expenses were flat sequentially.     We anticipate net income will be relatively flat quarter over quarter in Q1, as improvements in both  domestic and international streaming profits will be offset by a decline in DVD contribution profit and  increases in global operating expenses.  Free Cash Flow & Capital    In Q4, the gap between free cash flow (negative $51 million) and net income (positive $8 million)  widened as a result of payments for the original programs coming to Netflix in 2013. Significant uses of  cash in the quarter (relative to net income) were cash payments for both originals and non-originals                         10      content (in excess of the P&L expense), cash payments for PP&E (related to the continued rollout of our  Open Connect servers), and tax payments.    In the past, we have managed our content licensing agreements such that cash payments in any quarter  do not exceed 110% of the P&L expense (in other words, if our P&L expense was $200 million in the  quarter, our cash payments for content would not exceed $220 million in the quarter).  As we shared on  our last earnings call, our original programming will require more up-front cash payments than most  other content licensing agreements, raising this ratio (of cash to P&L for content) to as high as 120% in  certain quarters with material originals payments. The bulk of our remaining cash payments for our  current originals will be in Q1, driving FCF materially more negative than Q4, and then FCF will improve  substantially in subsequent quarters.    As highlighted previously, we have sufficient cash on hand to fund our current slate of originals and  ongoing expenses, and to maintain an adequate reserve, before returning to positive FCF.    In addition, we are exploring taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment to refinance  our $200 million in outstanding notes and raise additional cash through new debt financing.  This would  give us additional reserves as well as increased flexibility to fund future originals.  Miscellaneous    For management purposes, we look at the relatively modest overhead expenses (mostly personnel) in  our global content acquisition group as part of G&A, and as such we don't allocate them across our  three business segments.  For our global marketing team, however, the also relatively modest overhead  costs were historically allocated entirely to just the domestic streaming segment.  Starting in Q1,  marketing overhead will be part of G&A, consistent with how we treat content overhead, and will not be  allocated to the domestic streaming segment.  This is about $5 million of expense in Q1, so the change  will slightly increase domestic streaming contribution profit, and slightly increase global operating  expense by the same amount.  There is no change to operating income, net income, cash flows, or any  other global metric.     Starting in July, Reed has some 10-year employee options expiring every month, and he plans to sell  upon forced-exercise.  He has no other sales planned.    Carl Icahn became a 10% investor last quarter at approximately $58 per share.  We have no further  news about his intentions, but have had constructive conversations with him about building a more  valuable company.                                 11      Business Outlook      Summary    Netflix offers consumers what they want -- compelling content and control over how and when they  watch it.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: 1    July 24th, 2012      Dear Fellow Shareholders,  In Q2, we achieved financial performance in the top half of our guidance in nearly every metric, and  have returned to profitability.    66 months ago, we launched Netflix streaming in the US with limited selection.   Now, we have 24  million domestic streaming members and an incredible selection of TV shows and movies.  Networks  that license us prior season TV shows are in several cases benefiting from record audience numbers in  the current season, partly due to the availability and promotion of prior seasons on Netflix. We are  growing our business, and helping to grow the entire industry.    22 months ago, we launched our first international market:  Canada.  Since then we've grown to over  10% of Canadian households, made substantial increases in our content selection, and achieved enough  scale to begin to generate contribution profits.    10 months ago, we launched Netflix in Latin America.  Recently we surpassed one million members in  the region and announced that one of the year's biggest films, The Hunger Games, would debut on  our service only five months after its theatrical release.  With a population ten times the size of Canada,  Latin America remains a huge opportunity for us.   6 months ago, we launched Netflix in the UK and Ireland, and today we are one million members strong.    We believe we have pulled ahead of LOVEFiLM in every important streaming-related metric. Going  forward, competing effectively with Sky is our core and substantial challenge.     This growth in each of our markets reflects our investment in an easy-to-use personalized selection  experience, ever more compelling content, and higher quality streaming delivery.   Device by device,  title by title, network by network, market by market, we are constantly improving our service.   Q3 has begun strongly for us, and we expect to be profitable again in Q3.   In Q4, we will launch our next international market, which will drive us temporarily back into the red.    We have enormous challenges ahead, and no doubt will have further ups and downs as we pioneer  Internet television.  We are making progress in every market we serve, and see a once-in-a-generation  opportunity ahead to build the world's most popular TV show and movie service.    Our summary results follow:           2      Domestic Streaming  Q2 Results & Outlook  As we forecasted and explained in our April letter, domestic net additions will be more seasonal in 2012  compared to 2010 (2011 is an anomaly due to our mid-year price changes).  Roughly speaking, we would  therefore expect our net adds to be about equal to 2010 in Q1 and Q3, lower in Q2, and higher in Q4,  even given no change in the seasonality of gross adds.      Q2 came in as we expected, which is about 50% fewer domestic net adds than in Q2 2010.   For Q3 quarter-to-date, our domestic net additions are very nearly the same as Q3 2010 over the  comparable partial period.  In that quarter two years ago, we finished with 1.8 million domestic net  additions. However, in the middle of that quarter, we launched Netflix on the iPhone to great reception,   (in millions except per share data) Q2 '11 Q3 '11 Q4 '11 Q1 '12 Q2 '12 Domestic Streaming: Net Subscription Additions  -    -   0.22 1.74 0.53 Total Subscriptions  -   21.45 21.67 23.41 23.94 Paid Subscriptions  -   20.51 20.15 22.02 22.69 Revenue  -    -   $            476  $            507  $            533  Contribution Profit  -    -   $              52  $              67  $              83  Contribution Margin  -    -   10.9% 13.2% 15.6% International Streaming: Net Subscription Additions 0.16 0.51 0.38 1.21 0.56 Total Subscriptions 0.97 1.48 1.86 3.07 3.62 Paid Subscriptions 0.86 0.99 1.45 2.41 3.02 Revenue  $              19  $              23  $              29  $              43  $              65  Contribution Profit (Loss)  $              (9)  $            (23)  $            (60)  $          (103)  $            (89) Domestic DVD: Net Subscription Additions  -    -   (2.76) (1.08) (0.85) Total Subscriptions  -   13.93 11.17 10.09 9.24 Paid Subscriptions  -   13.81 11.04 9.96 9.15 Revenue  -    -   $            370  $            320  $            291  Contribution Profit  -    -   $            194  $            146  $            134  Contribution Margin  -    -   52.4% 45.6% 46.0% Global: Revenue  $            789  $            822  $            876  $            870  $            889  Net Income (Loss)  $              68  $              62  $              35  $              (5)  $                6  EPS  $           1.26  $           1.16  $           0.64  $         (0.08)  $           0.11  Free Cash Flow  $              60  $              14  $              34  $                2  $              11  Shares (FD) 53.9 53.9 55.4 55.5 58.8     3    and we don't have an equivalent launch this quarter. Moreover, this quarter the Olympics are likely to  have a negative impact on Netflix viewing and sign-ups.  So, our Q3 guidance is 1 million to 1.8 million  domestic net adds. If we finish Q3 in the high end of that range, we would remain on track for 7 million  domestic net additions for the year; otherwise it would be challenging to achieve that goal by year end.   In either case, we are generating impressive growth this year in our most developed market.    Our per-member viewing continues to rise on a year-over-year basis.   As our service improves,  members are choosing more often to enjoy Netflix.  The more members enjoy Netflix, the longer they  stay with us, and the more passionately they evangelize Netflix to their friends.     Our reputation with our members and their likelihood to recommend the Netflix service is steadily  improving.  Our original thesis was three years to full brand recovery (subsequent to the DVD-related  price increases last summer), and that seems correct so far.     Our domestic streaming contribution margin improved 200+ basis points sequentially for the second  consecutive quarter to 15.6% (up from 13.2% in Q1 and 10.9% in Q4), surpassing the year end  contribution margin target we outlined back in Q4 2011. The Q2 margin expansion was predominantly  driven by the planned sequential decline in marketing expense, while content expenses grew in line with  revenue (as compared to Q1). For Q3, our guidance implies a further 100 bps expansion in contribution  margin.   Looking out beyond Q3, we will continue to target gradual margin expansion of about 100 bps  per quarter, but any given quarter may see flatness sequentially as we accommodate lumpiness in  content library additions and the seasonality of subscriber net adds.    Domestic Content   Every quarter, we add fresh film and TV titles and episodes to our domestic content library, and we  continue to see good returns on these investments in the form of increased hours viewed by our  members.  Q2 domestic median hours viewed per member grew substantially year-over-year and total  hours were at record levels.   In the past, we have explained that the evolution of video streaming services to a large extent reflects  the legacy of television networks: namely, a reliance on exclusive content as a differentiator. Consistent  with this practice, we have increasingly licensed content on an exclusive basis, including titles such as  Mad Men, Breaking Bad and Gossip Girl.  This quarter we continued this practice, further  differentiating our service through a multi-year exclusive agreement with Warner Bros. for complete  previous seasons of hit shows Pretty Little Liars and The Lying Game.  Exclusivity on the film side is also relevant, and we continue to pursue both exclusive and non-exclusive  deals with our partners.  There are many different kinds of exclusivity in this area.  With EPIX, we  currently have exclusivity for online distribution, but EPIX is increasingly distributed by MVPD and TV  Everywhere.   Our online exclusivity expires shortly, but our agreement to carry EPIX content non- exclusively runs through mid-2013. On the strength of Paramount's and Lionsgate's film slates in 2011  and 2012, EPIX has become a great product and we look forward to our ongoing relationship.       4     We continue pursuing innovative deals with others.  One such deal is an output arrangement with The  Weinstein Company that will allow us to have an exclusive window for theatrical titles that will begin  after the expiration of their first Pay window.  This first-of-a-kind deal will give Netflix members access  to all Weinstein theatrical films in what had traditionally been the first Free TV window -- just 12 months  from the start of the Pay TV window, as opposed to the traditional holdback of nearly 8 years. Among  the titles we will soon have are last year's Academy Award winner, The King's Speech and the highly  acclaimed Blue Valentine.  Next year we'll get My Week with Marilyn and The Iron Lady.  In the meantime, our current feature film offering is better than ever with the arrival of Thor,  Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and Immortals which, together, generated more than $1.2 billion  in domestic box office.  In the coming months, we'll see additional great titles including crowd pleasers  like, Captain America, Abduction, Super 8 and Margin Call along with critically acclaimed films  like this year's Academy Award winner for Best Picture, The Artist, plus Albert Nobbs and  Bernie.   Over time, we will have one of the best feature film offerings in the market as more than one  third of the US box office generated year-to-date are from titles that will flow through our current deals  including The Hunger Games, The Avengers and The Lorax from major studios and Act of Valor,  Mirror, Mirror and The Grey from our mini-major partners.  We have often said that our licensing of complete back seasons of on-air TV series is not only a great  experience for Netflix members, but can help build the audience for new seasons of these series. Last  quarter, the audience for season five of Mad Men swelled subsequent to prior seasons becoming  available on Netflix. Last week, the fifth season of Breaking Bad debuted to record numbers, up 14%  from last year's premiere, no doubt buttressed by new viewers who were introduced to the series on  Netflix.  Sons of Anarchy on FX and The Walking Dead on AMC are additional examples of shows that  have seen season over season viewership growth with the availability of the complete series on Netflix.  Our unique ability to help members catch up at whatever point in the life of a series that suits them is  just one way we add value to our partners when they license their content to Netflix.   Domestic Competition   As we've explained in the past, we compete for consumers' viewing time with a variety of video services,  including linear TV, DVRs, over-the-top (OTT) pure plays, and authenticated streaming offerings of the  MVPDs and cable networks (TV Everywhere).   We have yet to see HuluPlus or Amazon Prime Instant Video gain meaningful traction relative to our  viewing hours, but as we continue to build a domestic profit stream they are likely to increase their  efforts to gain viewing share.  Redbox Instant by Verizon, once they launch, will face a big challenge to  break into the top 3 of subscription streaming services.  We believe our biggest long-term competition for viewing hours will come from MVPDs and cable  networks, both directly and through their TV Everywhere offerings.  MVPDs continue to improve their      5    offering, and Comcast's X1 interface, shown off at the recent cable show, is an impressive and leading  example of this work.  Our task is to keep raising the bar by operating on Internet pace, so that by the  time Comcast broadly rolls out X1 over the coming years, we'll be another generation ahead in member- pleasing experiences.    As for HBO, they continue to do great work with HBO GO, which is now available to most US households  that subscribe to the premium service.   While we compete for content and viewing time with HBO, it is  also possible we will find opportunities to work together – just as we do with other networks.    Consumers who are passionate about movies and TV shows are quite willing to subscribe to multiple  services.     International Streaming   We added nearly 0.6 million international streaming members in Q2, ending the quarter with 3.6 million  international members. Compared to Q1, average paid subscribers increased 41% in the quarter as we  continued to attract new members and convert free trials into paying subscribers. Our total  international subscriber base came in slightly lower than our forecast in April as we implemented  several up-front checks to validate consumer payment methods in Latin America. These changes  reduced our free trials relative to the forecast, but had limited impact on paid subscriber numbers. Our  international segment now represents 13% of total Netflix streaming members, and slightly over half of  the streaming net additions in the quarter.    UK and Ireland   Following our successful launch in the UK and Ireland in Q1, we are encouraged by the continued strong  growth of the service and today have one million members.  This growth has been driven, in part, by our  investments in content.  Over the past quarter, we have added great movies to the service, including the  critically acclaimed Drive and the family comedy Zookeeper in the Pay 1 TV window and recent  blockbusters Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Transformers and Mission Impossible III.  We  have also strengthened our TV offering.  Over the past three months, we launched all six seasons of the  hit series Lost, premiered the third season of the gritty drama Breaking Bad, and became the  exclusive home in the UK and Ireland of the indie comedy series Portlandia.  We will continue to expand and refresh our content offering in the coming quarter.  Notable new titles  will include the action-adventure film Abduction, the sentimental buddy comedy 50\/50 and  blockbusters 2012 and Iron Man 2.  Through our recently announced deal with Twentieth Century  Fox, we will be making available several top US TV series in Q3, including Sons of Anarchy, The Killing  and the Emmy-winning Modern Family.  Subscribers can also look forward to the next seasons of  Breaking Bad and Damages exclusively on Netflix. As with all of our markets, our content additions  are targeted to deliver incremental viewing, and therefore drive higher engagement and retention of  our members.       6    Looking past Q3, we feel our existing partnerships with local broadcasters and producers, US studios and  networks, and independent partners will continue to provide us access to compelling content.  For  example, our upcoming Pay 1 feature films account for 16% of UK Box Office year-to-date, compared to  an estimated 5% for LOVEFiLM's streaming service.   When we launched, we said Sky would be our primary competitor in the UK, and now we potentially  face increased competition from Sky's new OTT service Now TV at £15 per month, more than double  our price. This is Sky's first foray into a pure-play OTT streaming product and will likely be marketed  aggressively. Our content libraries are mutually exclusive with no overlap of titles; as such, many  households may subscribe to both services.   Canada   Our Canadian service continues to grow well – in both subscribers and hours viewed. Similar to trends in  the US, Q2 median hours viewed per member were up year-over-year in Canada. We have movies in the  first pay TV window from Paramount and Fox and our members are currently enjoying hit films like Rise  of the Planet of the Apes, Mr. Popper's Penguins and Kung Fu Panda 2. As in the US, the first four  seasons of Breaking Bad and all six seasons of Lost are setting viewing records in Canada for us.  We  achieved a small contribution profit in Canada in Q2 and expect to remain profitable in this market going  forward, as we manage our content and marketing expenses to grow more slowly than members and  revenue. We intend to steadily increase our contribution margin in much the same way as we are doing  for our US streaming business.   Latin America  In less than a year since expanding our service to Latin America, we are excited that we have more than  one million members. At the same time, given the huge market opportunity, we remain focused on  accelerating our growth by overcoming some of the many unique challenges in the region, namely, low  device penetration, an under-developed Internet infrastructure and consumer payment challenges for  ecommerce.  We are making progress in the area of payments. We have modified our sign-up flow to improve free  trial to paid subscriber conversion, and are in the process of expanding payment options in Mexico and  Brazil.  We are also closely tracking the performance of our content library to figure out the right formula for  adding content that results in higher viewing and therefore greater member engagement, retention and  positive word of mouth.  We're encouraged that the content additions we've made are having an  impact.   Our newest Mexican members are now watching more Netflix than their counterparts in the  US, Canada, or the UK.         7    Our content in the region keeps getting better. Global blockbuster The Hunger Games will debut on  our service in August, only five months after its worldwide theatrical release and on the same date as it  will be released on DVD and VOD in the region.  Additionally, our new deal with FOX has given Latin  American members access to hit shows such as, Glee, How I Met Your Mother, 24 and Prison  Break. Additionally, we are adding episodes of South Park and other on-air TV Series, such as,  Revenge, Once upon a Time, Parenthood, Parks and Recreation and Franklin & Bash. The  fourth season of Breaking Bad debuts for us in Latin America in September.  While challenges remain in the region, with subscribers and revenue growing, we are on-track to  capture the big opportunity that the region represents.   Next International Market   Given our return to global profitability this quarter and our continued success in the UK, we announced  last quarter that we've decided to open an additional attractive European market in Q4 of this year. We  will have more to say about this market later in Q3.    Total International Results & Outlook     Total international revenue of $65 million in Q2 increased 50% sequentially driven by the overall growth  in international members and the conversion of free trials to paid subscribers in both Latin America and  the UK and Ireland.  Total contribution loss of $89 million improved by $13 million compared to Q1, as  subscriber revenue growth exceeded the growth of content expenses while marketing expenses  declined post-UK launch.    Looking forward to Q3, we are guiding to a small increase in the international loss relative to Q2. Similar  to our experience in Canada last fall, the market opportunity we are experiencing in the UK is compelling  enough that we intend to grow our content spend to expand the library and to drive additional growth  in subscribers and viewing. Ultimately, our long-term goal in each market is to become the first  streaming service to reach scale, allowing us to achieve profitability and to expand margins over the  long-term.     We expect to exceed 4 million total international members in Q3, with another half million net additions  in the quarter (at the mid-point of guidance), consistent with Q2's net additions.  Our outlook assumes  that viewing of the summer Olympics in July will dampen acquisitions across all of our markets.   DVD  DVD subscriptions declined this quarter to 9.2 million, in-line with our expectations. About 6.7 million of  these 9.2 million also subscribe to our streaming service. The domestic DVD segment delivered $134  million of contribution profit in Q2, representing a 46% contribution margin, comparable to the Q1      8    margin. Going forward, we believe DVD member declines will continue to moderate, while contribution  margin will be roughly flat for the remainder of the year.  The first round of USPS processing center  reductions took effect in the first week of July.  So far, we see minimal service related impact from these  reductions.  Original Programming  Progress continues in the production of our previously announced original programs: House of Cards  began filming in Baltimore in April, Arrested Development and Orange Is the New Black are in the  writing phase, and principal photography has just begun on Hemlock Grove.  We look forward to the  debut of the entire first season of House of Cards in early 2013, and Arrested Development after  that. Additionally, we expect to deliver a second season of Lillyhammer in 2013 and our original  content team is working on expanding this lineup further.   Product Improvement  Our technology and development spending reflects our continued investments in improving the Netflix  experience.  In Q2, these investments produced improved Netflix players for both PC and Mac, as well as  the continued expansion of our Just for Kids feature, already on PC, Mac, Wii, PS3 and Apple TV, and  coming soon to the Xbox and iPad. In addition, we rolled out globally the much improved catalog sorting  algorithms that we initially launched in Q1 in the US, and added incremental search capabilities (such as  search by actor or director) to the PS3, with plans to roll-out this feature to other devices quickly.    Given our size and growth, it now makes economic sense for Netflix to have its own content delivery  network (CDN). As a result, we recently announced that we are enabling ISPs to get Netflix video data  from Open Connect, a single-purpose Netflix CDN. We'll continue to work with our commercial CDN  partners for the next few years, but eventually our data will be largely served by Open Connect. Like  commercial CDNs, Open Connect will provide the Netflix data at no cost to the locations the ISP desires,  or ISPs can choose to get the Netflix data at common Internet exchanges. About 10% of Netflix data is  already being served by Open Connect.   Global Profitability:  Q2 Results & Outlook  We achieved our goal of returning to global profitability this quarter by posting $6 million of net income,  and $0.11 EPS. Compared to Q1, margin expansion of the domestic streaming segment delivered an  incremental $17 million of contribution profit, more than offsetting the $12 million decline of DVD  contribution profit. Meanwhile, international losses moderated by $13 million and global operating  expenses (Technology & Development and G & A) were flat relative to Q1.     Our highly profitable US business, both streaming and DVD, is funding our international expansion. We  believe this is the right long-term approach.  In Q3, we expect to be profitable, while with the launch of  a fourth international market in Q4, we will move to a consolidated loss.       9        Free Cash Flow   In Q2, positive free cash flow of $11 million was roughly equivalent to our consolidated net income of $6  million and improved quarter-over-quarter largely because of the sequential improvement in net  income. Significant sources of cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock  compensation, depreciation expense in excess of PP&E purchases, and miscellaneous increases to  accounts payable and accrued expenses, which more than offset cash payments for content (in excess of  the P&L expense) and our bi-annual cash payment for interest on our notes.  In general, free cash flow and net income track each other reasonably closely with the primary  exception of payments for certain content deals (including original content and some output deals). We  expect content payments to cause free cash flow to trail net income in Q3. The use of cash for originals  will increase in Q4 and 2013 as we add more original programs.   We finished the quarter with $813 million in cash and equivalents.   New CMO - Kelly Bennett   We were excited yesterday to announce the appointment of Kelly Bennett as our Chief Marketing  Officer. Kelly comes to Netflix after nearly a decade at Warner Bros. where he was most recently Vice  President Interactive, World Wide Marketing with the pictures group, leading international online  campaigns for Warner Bros. movies. Before that Kelly ran digital marketing for Warner Bros. Pictures in  Europe, the Middle East and Africa and worked in promotion and business development in the  company.

Our technology and our content are both huge advantages in getting us to scale;  with scale comes further ability to invest.   We know our shareholders are depending on us to succeed at  our global expansion, market by market, and eventually return to substantial global profits.  Our growing  US streaming contribution profit stream shows what is possible.   We can't wait to serve a global  audience with an amazing Internet video experience.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: As we expected, growth has slowed with 2.2m paid net adds in Q3 vs. 6.8m in Q3'19. We think this is primarily due to our record first half results and the pull-forward effect we described in our April and July letters. In the first nine months of 2020, we added 28.1m paid memberships, which exceeds the 27.8m that we added for all of 2019. In these challenging times, we're dedicated to serving our members. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Q3 average streaming paid memberships rose 25%, while streaming ARPU decreased 1.6% year over year. Excluding a foreign exchange (F\/X) impact of -$158m, streaming ARPU increased 1% vs. prior year. Revenue was 2% above our beginning-of-quarter guidance primarily due to slightly higher than expected ARPU (favorable plan mix in our UCAN, LATAM and APAC regions plus intra-quarter appreciation in the Euro and British pound which helped lift EMEA ARPU). As a result, operating margin of 20% (up 170bps year over year) exceeded our guidance forecast as well. EPS of $1.74 vs. $1.47 a year ago included a $249m non-cash unrealized loss from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which accounted for the variance with our EPS guidance. We added 2.2m net memberships in Q3, compared with our 2.5m guidance. Retention remains healthy and engagement per member household was up solidly year over year in Q3'20. As a reminder, our 1guidance is our internal forecast and we strive for accuracy. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and, in others, it will be low. Our APAC region was the largest contributor to our paid membership growth this quarter (46% of Q3 global paid net adds) and APAC revenue rose 66% year over year. We're pleased with the progress we're making in this region and, in particular, that we've achieved double digit penetration of broadband homes in both South Korea and Japan. While this is encouraging, we still have much work to do and we're working hard to replicate this success in India and other countries. For Q4'20, we forecast 6.0m paid net adds vs 8.8m in Q4'19. As we have highlighted in our recent investor letters, we believe our record first half paid net additions would result in slower growth in the back half of this year. If we achieve our forecast, it will put us at a record 34m paid net adds for 2020, well above our prior annual high of 28.6m in 2018. The state of the pandemic and its impact continues to make projections very uncertain, but as the world hopefully recovers in 2021, we would expect that our growth will revert back to levels similar to pre-COVID. In turn, we expect paid net adds are likely to be down year over year in the first half of 2021 as compared to the big spike in paid net adds we experienced in the first half of 2020. We continue to view quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not that meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment, which we believe is still early and should provide us with many years of strong future growth as we continue to improve our service. 2We forecast Q4 operating margin of 13.5% vs. 8.4% last year, which means we'll over-deliver this year on our original full year margin target; our FY20 operating margin is now expected to be 18% (vs. 16% originally) or a 500 basis point increase year over year. Since 2016, we will have more than quadrupled our annual GAAP operating margin (which is our primary profitability metric). As in the past, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year and at an average rate of 300 basis points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate more lumpiness. Some years we'll be a little over (like this year when we expect to grow operating margin 500bps), some years a little under, but we are trying to keep on a 300 bps per year long-term trajectory. The increased lumpiness is due to increased F\/X exposure from our international success and COVID's impact on the timing of spending. By moving to this multi-year model, we'll be able to manage our short term expenses more smoothly as well as grow slightly more efficiently than in the past. As we wrote last quarter, for 2021, we're targeting a 19% operating margin. Content We are making good and careful progress returning to production, particularly in EMEA and APAC, but also across much of LATAM and UCAN. We've restarted production on some of our biggest titles including season four of Stranger Things, action film Red Notice (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot     and Ryan Reynolds) and The Witcher season two. Since the almost-global shutdown of production back   in mid-March, we have already completed principal photography on 50+ productions and, while the course and impact of C-19 remains unpredictable, we're optimistic we will complete shooting on over 150 other productions by year-end. For our 2021 slate, we continue to expect the number of Netflix originals launched on our service to be up year over year in each quarter of 2021 and we're confident that we'll have an exciting range of programming for our members, particularly relative to other entertainment service options. As 3discussed last quarter, some of our most popular returning titles are expected to launch in the second half of next year. This past quarter, the breadth of our programming was demonstrated with standout titles across many genres. In English language series, we debuted new seasons of The Umbrella Academy and Lucifer; 43m     and 38m member households chose to watch these titles in the first 28 days, respectively. In mid-September, we also premiered Ryan Murphy's Ratched, a thriller based on the character from One    Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. In its first four weeks, 48m member households chose to watch Ratched.    Our #1 and #2 most watched documentary feature films ever were released in Q3. American Murder:  The Family Next Door is projected to have 52m members households choose the title in its first 28 days  and The Social Dilemma had 38m in its first 28 days.   We continue to invest heavily in local language content because we believe that great stories are universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Season one of the Mexican telenovela Oscuro Deseo (Dark Desire) was our biggest local language original globally this quarter. Our     slate of Korean dramas continue to travel well throughout APAC and beyond, while anime is another category of content with fans all over the world. Another example of our content traveling around the globe is our non-fiction series Indian  Matchmaking, which was watched by a quarter of our members in India and millions of members  outside of India in its first four weeks. Original film continues to be an area of opportunity for us and we had several big hits in Q3. Action thriller The Old Guard (starring Charlize Theron and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood) was our most     popular title of the quarter with 78m member households choosing to watch in its first four weeks. Our romantic comedy The Kissing Booth 2 received strong reception (66m member households chose to   watch in the first 28 days), while action film Project Power (starring Jamie Foxx) was also very popular   (75m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks). Late in September, we debuted Enola  Holmes, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill as her famed detective brother. We estimate 76m  member households will have chosen this film in the first 28 days. Our content successes highlight our ability to tap into our global audience of nearly 200m members and underscore the notion that content is discovered on Netflix. This applies not only to Netflix originals, but   also to second run programming, like Schitt's Creek and earlier seasons of Lucifer, both of which are very     popular with our members. The latest example is Cobra Kai (based on The Karate Kid films), which     originally debuted on YouTube's subscription service in May 2018 and recently launched on Netflix on August 28. In its first four weeks of release on Netflix, 50m member households chose to watch season one, dramatically expanding its audience. We're looking forward to season 3 of Cobra Kai premiering exclusively on Netflix on January 8, 2021. In   addition to the recently released The Haunting of Bly Manor (a follow up to the acclaimed The Haunting    of Hill House), season one of Emily in Paris and Adam Sandler's latest film Hubie Halloween, other      notable Q4 titles include our animated family film Over the Moon from legendary creator Glen Keane   (premiering this weekend), season four of our award-winning series The Crown and the first season of   Selena. We'll also have a great slate of films, including The Midnight Sky (directed by and starring George    4Clooney), Hillbilly Elegy (from Ron Howard), Ma Rainey's Black  Bottom (with Viola Davis and Chadwick  Boseman), The Christmas Chronicles 2 (from Chris Columbus),  Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey (with  Forest Whitaker), MANK (David Fincher's first feature at Netflix) and Ryan Murphy's The Prom (starring  Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden and Kerry Washington).   Product and Partnerships  We strive to be a global entertainment service that can satisfy the needs of members all over the world.  Commissioning and producing local language content is an important part of that. But we also invest  heavily into improving our product, partnerships and overall consumer experience. For example, in India  in Q3, we localized our service to support Hindi in our user interface.    We're also working with local partners like Reliance Jio, India's largest mobile operator, where in Q3 we  launched a bundle with their mobile and fiber broadband plans. As part of this broad partnership, we'll  integrate Netflix with two of Jio's set top boxes. We've also partnered with financial institutions in India  to make payment processing easier and more seamless for our members, which we expect will have  retention benefits. All of these initiatives are important and work in concert with our big investment in  local originals to improve the Netflix experience for our members.   Competition  Competition for consumers' time and engagement remains vibrant.  Linear television and other big  categories of entertainment, like video games and user generated content from YouTube and TikTok are  all vying for consumers' attention and are strong drivers of screen time usage.  We remain quite small  relative to overall screen time.   This past quarter, we saw the debut of Comcast's Peacock, which comes on the heels of the launch of  HBO Max and Disney+. Disney's recent management reorganization signals that it is embracing the shift  to streaming entertainment. We're thrilled to be competing with Disney and a growing number of other  5  players to entertain people; both consumers and content creators will benefit from our mutual desire to  bring the best stories to audiences all over the world.   We'll continue to focus on pleasing our members and improving our service as quickly as possible so  that we can be everyone's first choice for online entertainment.   Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was +$1.3 billion vs. -$502 million in the prior year  period. Free cash flow (FCF)  was positive for a third consecutive quarter at +$1.1b vs. -$551 million in  1 Q3'19. Year to date free cash flow is +$2.2 billion vs. -$1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2019.   As productions increasingly restart, we expect Q4'20 FCF to be slightly negative and therefore, for the  full year 2020, we forecast FCF to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of  break-even to positive. This change is due primarily to our higher operating margin expectation for 2020  and the timing of cash spending on content. We expect our FCF profile over the coming years to  continue to improve as we increase our profitability and our transition to the production of Netflix  originals (which requires more cash upfront vs. second run content) matures. For 2021, we currently  expect free cash flow to be -$1 billion to break-even.  With $8.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter plus our $750m credit facility  (which is undrawn), our need for external financing is diminishing. As indicated last quarter, we don't  have plans to access the capital markets this year.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.  Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding the timing and business impact of the global recovery  from the affects of the COVID-19 pandemic; future content offerings and the number and timing of such  offerings; our content production schedules and return to production, including the course and impact  of the COVID-19 pandemic on content production; watch metrics for certain titles; partnerships;  adoption of internet entertainment; impact of competition; future capital raises and external financing  needs; global streaming paid members, paid net additions and membership growth; paid net additions,  consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings  per share; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks, including those related to the coronavirus pandemic; and,  competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and  events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 29, 2020, as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form  10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors  should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by Form 10-Q for the  quarter ended March 31, 2020.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Fellow shareholders,    We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew  streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million  in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than  doubled global operating income.  .    1  Q4 Results  Average paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in  ASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5%  margin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating  margin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year.   EPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items  that affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F\/X  remeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which  partially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed  repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform.   In Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last  year's record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than  expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet  entertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based.  In the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3  million. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although  contribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the  marketing spend we noted in last quarter's investor letter.   Internationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record  for quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F\/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue  and ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments  in a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017  (4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution  profit in our history.   We took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we've decided not to move forward  with. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected  expense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger  than expected member growth and the timing of international content spend.  Forecast  The guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net  adds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally.  As we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year  2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year.   We believe our big investments in content are paying off.  In 2017, average streaming hours per  membership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more  revenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018.   2  Big hits like 13 Reasons Why, Stranger Things and Bright result from a combination of great content and  great marketing. We're taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about  $1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content,  and we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We'll  grow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018.   Content  Q4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of The Crown and Black  Mirror as well as Stranger Things, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon. In the quarter, we  also successfully launched new titles like the limited series Godless, Marvel's The Punisher and  Mindhunter (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It's  amazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had three of the Top  5 most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row.   Our largest investment in original films to date, Bright, a fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a  major success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, Bright has become one of our  most viewed original titles ever. We're thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well  as additional investment in original films.   We're finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of Club de  Cuervos as well as The Day I Met El Chapo, both of which are from Mexico; Suburra from Italy; and an  unscripted series from the UK, Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father. We also debuted Dark, our first  German original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for  instance, Dark, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions  of members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with  attractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this  initiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland,  India, Korea and Japan.   We are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall  deals with Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy and Orange is the New Black and GLOW creator Jenji  Kohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over  the world.  Product and Partnerships  We are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our  mutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix,  while our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of  these types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche  Telekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC  removed the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net  3  neutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association's challenge to the  FCC's action.   Competition  We have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend  becomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On  the commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large  content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with  Apple Music or with iOS.   Facebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their  multi-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for  entertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix.   Traditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring  most of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand  and great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful  services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content  offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower  end of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of  content payments, which will now occur in 2018.   Our operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is  content. When we develop a title like Bright, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated  membership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for  self-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect  that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend  will turn our business FCF positive.   In the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We're  growing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had  planned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018.  Given our track record of content  investments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the  increased investments we are making in original content this year.   We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of  interest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to  grow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt.  High yield has rarely seen  an equity cushion so thick.  4  Board of Directors  We are pleased to add Rodolphe Belmer to our board of directors. Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+  Group in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing  percentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our  board.   Summary  Our goal is to entertain people. We are thrilled to be able to do that at great scale.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding our investments in marketing, technology and  5  development, and content, including original content; content and product partnerships; impact of U.S.  net neutrality rules; growth of internet video and competitive landscape; future capital raises;  expectations of positive free cash flow, impact of the new limitation on the deductibility of interest;  domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic and international operations, as well as consolidated operating  income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Revenue grew 24% year over year and was in line with our beginning of quarter forecast, while operating profit and margin reached all-time highs. We finished Q1'21 with 208m paid memberships, up 14% year over year, but below our guidance forecast of 210m paid memberships. We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays. We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup. In the short-term, there is some uncertainty from Covid-19; in the long-term, the rise of streaming to replace linear TV around the world is the clear trend in entertainment. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Average revenue per membership rose 6% year over year, or 5%, excluding a foreign exchange impact of 1 +$80m. Operating income of $2 billion vs. $958 million more than doubled vs. Q1'20. This exceeded our guidance forecast primarily due to the timing of content spend. EPS of $3.75 vs. $1.57 a year ago included a $253m non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The extraordinary events of Covid-19 led to unprecedented membership growth in 2020, as it pulled forward growth from 2021, and delayed production across every region. In turn, we ended 2020 with a bigger membership and revenue base than we would otherwise have had, contributing to record Q1'21 revenues. And since we were still ramping production levels late last year, we had lower content spend in 1 Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 Q1'21 - content amortization only grew 9.5% year over year in Q1'21 vs. 17% in FY20. The result was a 10 percentage point year over year jump in our operating margin to 27% in Q1, which is an all-time high. As we discussed in past letters, these dynamics are also contributing to a lighter content slate in the first half of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth. In Q1, paid net additions of 4m were below our 6m guidance (and the 16m net additions in the year ago quarter) primarily due to acquisition, as retention in Q1 was in line with our expectations. We don't believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor in the variance as the over-forecast was across all of our regions. We also saw similar percentage year-over-year declines in paid net adds in all regions (see our Regional Breakdown table below), whereas the level of competitive intensity varies by country. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and, in others, it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net additions performance vs. forecast. With similar pull forward and delayed slate dynamics plus our typical seasonality expected to impact Q2'21, we project paid net additions of 1m (vs. 10m in the prior year quarter) with our UCAN and LATAM regions expected to be roughly flattish in memberships (+\/- a couple hundred thousand paid net adds). We anticipate paid membership growth will re-accelerate in the second half of 2021 as we ramp into a very strong back half slate with the return of big hits like Sex Education, The Witcher, La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), and You, as well as an exciting array of original films including the finale to The Kissing Booth trilogy and large scale, star-driven features like Red Notice (starring Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds) and Don't Look Up (with an all-star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and Meryl Streep). We'll also have our most comprehensive offering to date of local language titles including Too Hot to Handle for Brazil and Mexico, 2 a special based on our Korean hit franchise Kingdom, the action-thriller Dhamaka (India), as well as new seasons of Sintonia (Brazil), and Control Z (Mexico). As always, we're focusing on the fundamentals of our business, which remain healthy. In addition to our record financial results, engagement per member household grew solidly year over year in Q1'21. We're also seeing how much members value Netflix with Q1'21 churn below Q1'20 levels, demonstrating that as we improve the service, we can charge a bit more. Our FY21 operating margin target of 20% vs. 18% last year remains unchanged. We are optimistic about the future and believe we are still in the early days of the adoption of internet entertainment, which should provide us with many years of growth ahead. Content As seen in the weekly growth chart above, in early Q1, with the benefit of Bridgerton, Lupin and Cobra Kai, we were following a growth trajectory similar to recent years. As we've noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will lead to a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises. And while the roll out of vaccines is very uneven across the world, we are back up and producing safely in every major market, with the exception of Brazil and India. Assuming this continues, we'll spend over $17 billion in cash on content this year and we'll continue to deliver an amazing range of titles for our members with more originals this year than last. There are several facets to our content strategy. First and foremost, we want to deliver a wide variety of best-in-class stories that our members love and watch in big numbers. Examples of this breadth in Q1 include season one of Firefly Lane (49m chose to watch this title in its first 28 days), season 3 of Cobra Kai (45m), Fate: The Winx Saga (57m), and Ginny & Georgia (52m). Our top movies in Q1 include I Care A Lot (56m), YES DAY (62m), Outside the Wire (66m) and the last installment of To All the Boys I've Loved 3 Before trilogy (51m). We program across many genres because tastes are very diverse. Even for one person, what they desire will vary widely depending on their mood or who they are watching with. Another goal is to create great, locally authentic stories in countries all around the world. It's why our priority for local language titles is to have a big impact in the home territory so we don't sacrifice local impact for travelability. But we're increasingly seeing that these local titles find significant audiences around the world, which supports our thesis that great stories are universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Notable standouts this quarter include Below Zero from Spain (47m chose to watch in its first four weeks), Space Sweepers from Korea (26m), Squared Love from Poland (31m) and Who Killed Sara? from Mexico (an estimated 55m), which is also our most popular non-English title ever in the US in its first 28 days (with season 2 launching on May 19). We want our titles to be talked about by audiences across the globe. Because of our broad distribution and highly engaged members, our titles not only generate high levels of viewing but also can pierce the cultural zeitgeist and transcend the film and TV industry. There were two recent standout examples of this: Lupin, our French language series about a daring gentleman burglar played by Omar Sy, was not only our most popular new title this quarter on Netflix (76m member households chose to watch in the first 28 days), but it also propelled book sales of the novel in France; Lupin: Part 2 will debut later in Q2'21. Similarly, driven by the late December launch of season one of Bridgerton, Julia Quinn's books hit The New York Times bestseller list for the first time in 18 years. Netflix led all studios for recent award nominations including the Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG Awards, BAFTA and the NAACP Image Awards, among others. Heading into the Academy Awards this weekend, we have 36 nominations across 17 films including two nominees in each of the Best Picture (Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7), Best Documentary Feature (Crip Camp, My Octopus Teacher), and Best Animated Feature (Over the Moon, A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon) categories. Mank led all films with 10 nominations. Product We are constantly working to make it easier for members to access and enjoy something they will love, regardless of their location or mood. In Q1, we launched an opt-in Downloads for You feature for Android (with iOS coming soon) that automatically downloads recommended shows and movies onto a member's mobile device, ensuring that they always have something to watch irrespective of connectivity. Knowing that bandwidth and storage can be precious, this feature tries to choose only the most relevant content to download. This quarter we also launched Fast Laughs, a mobile feed of short comedy clips from Netflix favorites - it's initially available in several countries including the US on iOS and will be on Android soon. For television viewers, this month we unveiled an updated and improved experience for Kids Profile that more vividly and easily connects children with their favorite titles and characters. 4 Competition We compete with many activities for consumers' entertainment time, ranging from watching linear TV, video gaming, and viewing user generated content, just to name a few. Against this backdrop, the entertainment market is huge, giving us plenty of room to grow, if we can continue to improve our service. We believe we are less than 10% of TV screen time in the US and even smaller in other regions and when including mobile devices. More and more new streaming services are launching, reinforcing our vision that linear TV will slowly give way to streaming entertainment. Despite our 10+ year head start, we are continually seeking operational and creative excellence; we're working as hard as ever to continually improve our service so that we are the best entertainment option available with best in class stories, an ever-improving product experience and authentic local titles that our members love. Our ability to evolve from a DVD-by-mail to an internet entertainment business, from a US-only to a global service, and from a licensor of second window content to a producer of original content across so many different categories fuels our confidence and optimism for our next decade of challenges, growth and innovation. When comparing services, subscriber figures alone tell only part of the story (given bundles, discounts and other promotions) so it's important to also focus on engagement and revenue as key indicators of success; they drive the flywheel of investment in even more amazing stories for our members and future growth. It's our job to please our members so much on Monday, that on Tuesday, they start with us, and then they stick with us as their first choice for entertainment. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $777 million vs. $260 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was $692 million vs. $162 million in Q1'20. We are on track 2 for full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately break even. As we discussed last quarter, we believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive and that we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repaid our 5.375% February 1, 2021 bond ($500 million principal) out of balance sheet cash, reducing our total gross debt balance to $15.7 billion as of March 31, 2021. We intend to maintain $10-$15 billion of gross debt. Our board has approved a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock beginning in 2021 with no fixed expiration date. We expect our buyback program will begin this quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We've added a new section to our investor relations site that collates all of our ESG information for our investors, including our recently published 2020 ESG Report (filed March 30, 2021). Our 2020 ESG report includes our commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022. We also 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5 released our first Inclusion Report around the makeup of our workforce and a third-party diversity audit of our content by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, designed to set industry benchmarks around these important issues.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: We had a strong finish to 2019, with Q4 revenue growing 31% year over year, bringing full year 2019 revenue to over $20 billion, while FY19 operating income rose 62% to $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we surpassed 100 million paid memberships outside of the US. Streaming entertainment is a global phenomenon and we're working hard to build on our early progress. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast In Q4, average streaming paid memberships grew 21% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 9% year over year. Excluding a -$133 million impact from foreign currency, streaming ARPU rose 12% year over year. Operating income in Q4 amounted to $459m (vs. $216m last year). While this was slightly lower than our beginning-of-quarter forecast of $475m, we're primarily managing by our full year operating margin target, which we met (13% in FY19 vs. 10% in FY18). EPS for Q4 amounted to $1.30 vs. $0.30 a year ago. During Q4, the US Treasury issued final regulations on certain aspects of the 2017 US tax reform. As a result, we had over-accrued in the first three quarters of 2019 for tax, which was adjusted in Q4, resulting in our net income being higher than operating  income this quarter. We paid US corporate taxes for the full year inclusive of this Q4 adjustment. 1Global paid net additions totaled 8.8m in Q4, on par with the 8.8m in the prior year period and ahead of our forecast of 7.6m, fueled by our broad slate of original programming and the worldwide adoption of streaming video. We generated Q4-record paid net adds in each of the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions, while UCAN paid net adds totaled 0.55m (with 0.42m in the US) vs. 1.75m in the year ago quarter. Our low membership growth in UCAN is probably due to our recent price changes and to US competitive launches. We have seen more muted impact from competitive launches outside the US (NL, CA, AU). As always, we are working hard to improve our service to combat these factors and push net adds higher over time. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1'20, we forecast global paid net adds of 7.0m vs. 9.6m in Q1'19, which was an all-time high in quarterly paid net adds. Our Q1'20 forecast reflects the continued, slightly elevated churn levels we are seeing in the US plus an expectation for more balanced paid net adds across Q1 and Q2 this year, with seasonality more similar to 2018 than 2019. This is due in part to the timing of last year's price changes and a strong upcoming Q2 content slate, where we'll have some of our bigger titles like La Casa De Papel  (aka Money Heist) season 4.   We're targeting a 16% operating margin in 2020 (up 300 basis points year over year). As a reminder, large swings in foreign exchange (F\/X) could lead to some temporary variations from our annual margin progression, partially because we don't spend on derivatives to hedge our F\/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars. Content Great content grows engagement among our members, which we believe drives word-of-mouth, improves retention and grows paid memberships. We have many exciting releases for Q1'20 including 2returning seasons of Sex Education, Altered Carbon, Narcos: Mexico, the Spanish series Elite and Korean        historical zombie thriller Kingdom, as well as action film Spenser Confidential (starring Mark Wahlberg)     and the movie sequel To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You. New original series include the recently   released Messiah and the buzzy docu-series Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez and the     upcoming I Am Not Okay with This.  These titles build off of a highly successful Q4 content slate, which included new seasons of The Crown,  Big Mouth and You and new series and films like Rhythm & Flow, American Son, Turkish series The Gift         and French film Banlieusards (aka Street Flow). The psychological thriller You, which originated on US       linear TV with a modest audience, has evolved into a global phenomenon on Netflix; we estimate, based on the first few weeks, 54m member households will choose to watch season 2 in its first 4 weeks. In its first four weeks, over 21m member households have chosen to watch season 3 of The Crown (up over   40% from Season 2 over the same time period) and in total, over 73m households worldwide have chosen The Crown since the series launched. The Crown and the all new Season 3 cast just won the     Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama series and star Olivia Colman won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series. During December, we also launched The Witcher, which is tracking to be our biggest season one TV    series ever. Through its first four weeks of release, 76m member households chose to watch this  action-packed fantasy, starring Henry Cavill. As a testament to how our hit content can penetrate the global zeitgeist and influence popular culture, the show's launch drove up sales of The Witcher books   and games around the world, and spawned a viral musical hit.     Our Q4 movie slate set a new bar for the variety and high quality of films we produce to appeal to our members' many different tastes. We released 6 Underground, from director Michael Bay and starring   Ryan Reynolds, and 83m member households chose this crowd-pleasing action film through its first four weeks. The exceptional breadth and quality of our film slate was recognized as we led all studios with 24 Academy Award nominations across eight different films. The nominated feature films produced by the Netflix studio like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes were also very popular with our       members. Having launched our original film initiative just under five years ago, this is a proud achievement and a testament to the creative talent with whom we partner.  Across both film and TV, we were also recognized for being the home for storytellers and creators from many diverse backgrounds. We're honored to lead the industry in nominations at both the NAACP Image  Awards (42 nominations) and the GLAAD Media Awards (15 nominations).    We know that local audiences love local stories. In fact, local originals were the most popular 2019 titles in many countries, including India, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Thailand, Sweden and the UK. In addition, we've seen how members all around the world also love these stories with La Casa de Papel\/Money  Heist appearing on our top ten lists in more than 70 countries. K-content is also popular globally, and  we're investing heavily in Korean stories. In this past quarter, we inked a TV output deal with JTBC, a leading Korean media company, and a strategic partnership with CJ ENM's Studio Dragon, Korea's largest TV studio. These deals will enable us to bring more K-dramas to fans all over the world. 3Over the past several years, we've been developing an animation studio within Netflix to produce a wide array of animated content for kids, adults and families. We have amazing creators with pedigree from Disney Animation, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination now working at Netflix on their next big projects. In Q4, we debuted filmmaker Sergio Pablos' Klaus, our first original feature-length   animated film that was also nominated for an Academy Award. In its first 28 days, 40m members chose to watch this heartwarming Santa Claus origin story. Later in 2020, we'll premiere the ambitious Over  The Moon, from legendary animator Glen Keane, followed by a schedule that builds to several big  animated feature films per year. As we've expanded our original content, we've been working on how to best share content highlights that demonstrate popularity. Given that we now have titles with widely varying lengths - from short episodes (e.g. Special at around 15 minutes) to long films (e.g. The Highwaymen at 132 minutes), we     believe that reporting households viewing a title based on 70% of a single episode of a series or of an entire film, which we have been doing, makes less sense. We are now reporting on households (accounts) that chose to watch a given title1. Our new methodology is similar to the BBC iPlayer in their rankings based on requests for the title, most popular articles on the New York Times which include  those who opened the articles, and YouTube view counts. This way, short and long titles are treated equally, leveling the playing field for all types of our content including interactive content, which has no fixed length. The new metric is about 35% higher on average than the prior metric. For example, 45m member households chose to watch Our Planet under the new metric vs. 33m under the prior metric.   Product and Partnerships In Product, we are investing our resources to grow engagement and our storytelling capabilities (like the branching narratives in Black Mirror: Bandersnatch), deepen our penetration in key markets and help   our members find great content through better suggestions. To do this, we try many approaches; in 2019 alone, we conducted hundreds of product tests to try to improve our member experience from sign up to billing and payments to content discovery. About 30% of these led to a gain in retention, engagement or revenue, up from 20% in the prior year. It's a humbling exercise as so many of our ideas do not win with members, but this helps tune our judgment and innovation priorities for the future. In Q4, we launched a mobile-only plan in Malaysia and Indonesia (which we introduced to India in Q3 last year). We've seen similar results with this plan driving incremental subscriber growth and improving retention. We expect the mobile-only plan to be revenue-positive which will allow us to further invest in content to be enjoyed by our members and continue to feed the virtuous cycle. We plan to continue to test adding this plan, as well as additional ideas in other countries around the world. Competition Many media companies and tech giants are launching streaming services, reinforcing the major trend of the transition from linear to streaming entertainment. This is happening all over the world and is still in its early stages, leaving ample room for many services to grow as linear TV wanes. We have a big 1 Chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes -- long enough to indicate the choice was intentional -- is the precise definition 4headstart in streaming and will work to build on that by focusing on the same thing we have focused on for the past 22 years - pleasing members. We believe if we do that well, Netflix will continue to prosper. As an example, in Q4, despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the US on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters. Below is a comparison of Google search trends for The Witcher, Disney's The Mandalorian, Amazon's       Jack Ryan and Apple's The Morning Show.    Disney+ were global we don't think the picture would be much different, to judge from the NL results where Disney+ first launched.   Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q4, net cash used in operating activities was -$1.5 billion vs. -$1.2 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2 in Q4 totaled -$1.7 billion vs. -$1.3 billion in Q4'18. For the full year, FCF was -$3.3 billion which we believe is the peak in our annual FCF deficit. Our plan is to continually improve FCF each year and to move slowly toward FCF positive. For 2020, we currently forecast FCF of approximately -$2.5 billion. Along the way, we'll continue to use the debt market to finance our investment needs as we did in Q4'19, when we raised $1.0 billion 4.875% senior notes and 1.1 billion 3.625% senior notes, both due in 2030. With our FCF profile improving, this means € that over time we'll be less reliant on public markets and will be able to fund more of our investment needs organically through our growing operating profits. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2019, July 2019, April 2019,       January 2019, October 2018, July 2018, April 2018, January 2018.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding global paid net additions; churn; seasonality;;  distribution of net adds across quarters; full-year operating margin target; future content offerings;  product tests; revenue impact of product changes; future capital raises; reliance on public markets for  cash needs; impact of competition; global streaming paid memberships and growth; consolidated  revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and  peak free cash flow.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Our revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show. Streaming is winning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently. While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth - through improvements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing - we'll be holding our operating margin at around 20%. Key to our success has been our ability to create amazing entertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewing than our competitors. These are Netflix's core strengths and competitive advantages. Together with our strong profitability, we believe we have the foundation from which we can both significantly improve, and better monetize, our service longer term. Growth Outlook Since launching streaming in 2007, we've operated under the firm belief that internet-delivered, on demand entertainment will supplant linear TV, and that this transition represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a highly popular and profitable entertainment company. People love movies, TV shows and games; broadband and smart TV penetration continue to grow globally with more and more connected devices; and while hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world's broadband homes don't yet, representing huge future growth potential. 1 In the near term though, we're not growing revenue as fast as we'd like. COVID clouded the picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021 was due to the COVID pull forward. Now, we believe there are four main inter-related factors at work. First, it's increasingly clear that the pace of growth into our underlying addressable market (broadband homes) is partly dependent on factors we don't directly control, like the uptake of connected TVs (since the majority of our viewing is on TVs), the adoption of on-demand entertainment, and data costs. We believe these factors will keep improving over time, so that all broadband households will be potential Netflix customers. Second, in addition to our 222m paying households, we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over 100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region. Account sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn't changed much over the years, but, coupled with the first factor, means it's harder to grow membership in many markets - an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth. Third, competition for viewing with linear TV as well as YouTube, Amazon, and Hulu has been robust for the last 15 years. However, over the last three years, as traditional entertainment companies realized streaming is the future, many new streaming services have also launched. While our US television viewing share, for example, has been steady to up according to Nielsen, we want to grow that share faster. Higher view share is an indicator of higher satisfaction, which supports higher retention and revenue. Fourth, macro factors, including sluggish economic growth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID are likely having an impact as well. 2 Our plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix - in particular the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our members value most. On the content side, we're doubling down on story development and creative excellence, which we see reflected in big Q1'22 TV hits like Bridgerton (627 million hours viewed for season 2 *, our 1 biggest English language series in our history) and Inventing Anna (512m hours viewed) - both from our extremely successful partnership with Shonda Rhimes - and films like Tinder Swindler (166m hours viewed, our biggest documentary film ever released) and The Adam Project (233m hours viewed), which come on the back of our Q4 hits Red Notice and Don't Look Up. On the product side, we recently launched double thumbs up so members can better express what they truly love versus simply like - enabling us to continue to improve our personalized recommendations and overall experience. This focus on continuous improvement has served us well over the past 25 years - from our big battle with Blockbuster nearly 20 years ago through the launch and growth of streaming, to the switch from licensed second run TV series and films to original programming, and our development from a domestic business with primarily English language content to a global entertainment service. It's why we are now the largest subscription streaming service in the world on all key metrics: paid memberships, engagement, revenue and profit. Another focus is how best to monetize sharing - the 100M+ households using another household's account. This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying our service. Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. And we've always tried to make sharing within a member's household easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams. While these have been very popular, they've created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households. So early last year we started testing different approaches to monetize sharing and, in March, introduced two new paid sharing features, where current members have the choice to pay for additional households, in three markets in Latin America. There's a broad range of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing. So while we won't be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it's a large short- to mid-term opportunity. As we work to monetize sharing, growth in ARM, revenue and viewing will become more important indicators of our success than membership growth. Over the longer term, much of our growth will come from outside the US. Traditionally, US entertainment companies have viewed international as an export market for US content. But we saw long ago that great stories can be made anywhere and loved everywhere - dramatically broadening the pool of creators with whom we can work, increasing the variety of our programming and better serving local tastes. To support this, we've been building out capabilities like creative development, personalization, and language presentation\/localization. Netflix is now producing films and TV in more than 50 countries with a high degree of integration in the local entertainment ecosystem resulting in the creation of blockbusters from every region. In fact, three out of our six most popular TV seasons of all time are non-English language titles: Squid Game, La Casa de Papel Part 4 and All Of Us Are Dead, which 1 Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through April 17, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed at Netflix Top 10. 3 launched in Q1'22 and has accumulated 561m hours viewed in its first four weeks. So an important focus is working to extend our lead in this area. Our goal is to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating income even faster (as we expand margins) and generate growing positive free cash flow (FCF). During this period of slower revenue growth, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange (F\/X), we aim to protect our profitability and manage to a minimum operating margin roughly in line with current levels (i.e., this year's 19-20% guidance). Once we've re-accelerated revenue growth, we're committed to steadily growing our operating margin. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Our 10% revenue growth in Q1'22 was driven by an 8% year over year increase in average streaming paid memberships and 2% year over year growth in ARM . Excluding a F\/X impact of -$280 million, year over 2 year revenue and ARM growth were +14% and +6%, respectively. Operating income of $2.0 billion was above our beginning of quarter forecast of $1.8 billion due to lower than projected content expense. EPS of $3.53 vs. $3.75 a year ago included a $162 million non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Paid net additions were -0.2m compared against our guidance forecast of 2.5m and 4.0m in the same quarter a year ago. The suspension of our service in Russia and winding-down of all Russian paid memberships resulted in a -0.7m impact on paid net adds; excluding this impact, paid net additions totaled +0.5m. The main challenge for membership growth is continued soft acquisition across all regions. Retention was also slightly lower relative to our guidance forecast, although it remains at a very healthy level (we believe among the best in the industry). Recent price changes are largely tracking in-line with our expectations and remain significantly revenue positive. In EMEA (-0.3M paid net adds, or +0.4m excluding the Russia impact), we saw a slowdown in our business in Central and Eastern Europe in March, coinciding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Paid net additions in LATAM totaled -0.4M; similar to recent quarters, we believe a combination of forces including macroeconomic weakness and our price changes (F\/X neutral ARM grew 20% year over year) were a drag on our membership growth. UCAN paid net adds of -0.6M was largely the result of our price change which is tracking in-line with our expectations and is significantly revenue positive. We're making good progress in APAC where we are seeing nice growth in a variety of markets including Japan, India, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2'22, we forecast paid net additions of -2.0m vs. +1.5m in the year ago quarter. Our forecast assumes our current trends persist (such as slow acquisition and the near term impact of price changes) plus typical seasonality (Q2 paid net adds are usually less than Q1 paid net adds). We project revenue to grow approximately 10% year over year in Q2, assuming roughly a mid-to-high single digit year over year 2 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 4 increase in ARM on a F\/X neutral basis. We still target a 19%-20% operating margin for the full year 2022, assuming no material swings in F\/X rates from when we set this goal in January of 2022. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $923 million vs. $777 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow amounted to $802 million vs. $692 million. We continue to expect to be free cash 3 flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. During the quarter, we completed two acquisitions (leading visual effects company Scanline and gaming studio Boss Fight Entertainment), which had a -$125 million impact on cash. We also announced our purchase of Helsinki-based gaming company Next Games. We've completed the tender offer and expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2022. We finished Q1 with gross debt of $14.6 billion after repaying $700 million of our senior notes. We're now within the top end of our gross debt target range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $6.0 billion, net debt was $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter, equating to a 1.3x LTM leverage ratio . Given those uses 4 of cash and our minimum cash target, we didn't engage in share repurchase activity during the quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We recently published our 2021 ESG Report (March 30, 2022). We've made good progress on our climate commitments announced last year - reducing or avoiding more than 14,000 metric tons of emissions in 2021. This enabled us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 footprint by more than 10% from what it otherwise would have been and puts us on track to cut 45% of these emissions by 2030. We continue to develop our inclusion lens. In 2021, women made up 51.7% of our global workforce , up 5 from 48.7% in 2020. Half of our US workforce (50.5%) is made up of people from one or more historically excluded ethnic and\/or racial backgrounds, including Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern, Native American, and Pacific Islander . That's up from 46.8% in the previous year. The number of US 6 Black employees increased from 8.6% to 10.7% and Black leadership increased from 10.9% to 13.3%. The number of US Hispanic or Latino employees increased from 7.9% to 8.6%, and US Hispanic or Latino leadership grew slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%. As noted in our last investor letter and our 2022 preliminary proxy, the board has decided to recommend to shareholders that Netflix evolve to a more standard large cap company governance structure.

IR Contact: Spencer Wang VP, Finance\/IR & Corporate Development 408 809-5360 PR Contact: Jonathan Bing Director, Corporate Communications 818 643-0146 Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of free cash flow, last twelve months (LTM) leverage ratio, and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow, LTM leverage ratio and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: After a lighter-than-normal content slate in Q1 and Q2 due to COVID-related production delays in 2020, we are seeing the positive effects of a stronger slate in the second half of the year. In Q3, we grew revenue 16% year over year to $7.5 billion, while operating income rose 33% vs. the prior year quarter to $1.8 billion. We added 4.4m paid net adds (vs. 2.2m in Q3'20) to end the quarter with 214m paid memberships. We're very excited to finish the year with what we expect to be our strongest Q4 content offering yet, which shows up as bigger content expense and lower operating margins sequentially. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 9% and 7% increase in average paid streaming memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding a foreign exchange (FX)impact of +$128m, ARM rose 5% year over year. Operating margin for Q3 amounted to 23.5%, a three percentage point increase vs. the year ago period. This was above our beginning of quarter forecast due to the timing of content spend, as well as lower than forecasted marketing spend. EPS of $3.19 vs. $1.74 a year ago included a $136m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We under-forecasted paid net adds for the quarter (4.4m actual vs. our 3.5m projection), while ending paid memberships of 214m was within 0.4% of our forecast. For the second consecutive quarter, the APAC region was our largest contributor to membership growth with 2.2m paid net adds (half of total paid net adds) as we are continuing to improve our service in this region. In EMEA, paid net adds of 1.8m improved sequentially vs. the 188k in Q2 as several titles had a particularly strong impact. The UCAN and 1ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1LATAM regions grew paid memberships more slowly. These regions have higher penetration of broadband homes although we believe we still have ample runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q4'21, we forecast paid net adds of 8.5m, consistent with Q4'20 paid net additions. For the full year 2021, we forecast an operating margin of 20% or slightly better. This means that Q4'21 operating margin will be approximately 6.5% compared with 14% in Q4'20. The year over year decline in operating margin is due mostly to our backloaded big content release schedule in this Q4, which will result in a roughly 19% year over year increase in content amortization for Q4'21 (compared with ~8% growth year to date). Content Our programming strategy is to provide members with a wide variety of high quality content that's loved and watched in large numbers. Season five ofLa Casade Papel(akaMoney Heist) and season three of Sex Educationwere two of our biggest returning showsin the quarter with 69m and 55m member households, respectively, choosing to watch these fan favorites in the first four weeks. On the heels of The Queen's Gambit, we've had another limited serieshit withMaidwhich launched just after quarter-end on October 1. We expect this story about living on the poverty line by award-winning playwright and screenwriter Molly Smith Metzler to reach 67m households during its first four weeks. La Casa de Papelwas our first non-English languagetitle to show that - with subtitling and dubbing - great stories truly can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world. While the goal of our local content executives is always to create locally authentic stories that will resonate in their country (likeThe Chestnut Manwhich we expect to be watched by 2approximately two thirds of our Danish members during its first four weeks), Netflix is a global, direct-to-consumer service which enables creators to reach broader audiences - and gives our members an even greater choice of stories to enjoy. There is no better example of this thanSquid Game,a unique Korean story that first captured the zeitgeist in Korea and then globally. Released on September 17, it has becomeour biggest TV show ever. A mind-boggling142mmember households globally havechosen to watch the title in its first four weeks. The breadth ofSquid Game's popularity is truly amazing;this show has been ranked as our #1 program in 94 countries (including the US). Like some of our other big hits,Squid Gamehas also pierced the cultural zeitgeist, spawning aSaturday Night Liveskitandmemes\/clips on TikTokwith more than 42 billion views. Demand for consumer products to celebrate the fandom forSquid Gameis high and those items are on their way to retail now. Our film slate also continues to build with a variety of successful Q3 titles such as action filmSweetGirl starring Jason Momoa (68m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks),Kissing Booth 3 (59m), the last installment in the rom com trilogy, the animated family filmVivo(46m) andBlood Red Sky, a German-language action horror movie (53m). Later in the year, we will shift to reporting on hours viewed for our titles rather than the number of accounts that choose to watch them. There is some difference in rankings, as you see below, but we think engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction. It also matches how outside services measure TV viewing and gives proper credit to rewatching. In addition, we will start to release title metrics more regularly outside of our earnings report so our members and the industry can better measure success in the streaming world. 3* Total hours viewed per title in its first 28 days on Netflix. ** The number of accounts that have watched at least two minutes of that title in its first 28 days on Netflix. Data as of 9\/27\/21. We're honored to have garnered the most Emmys ever for any single network or service in a season of television, with 44 (tying CBS' tally in 1974 when there were only three national networks). This included our first best Drama series win (The Crown), while The Queen's Gambit won 11 out of 18 nominations, including the coveted best limited series. Both titles are among our most popular ever, demonstrating critical and commercial success. During Q3, we announced our agreement to acquire the Roald Dahl Story Company, pending regulatory approval. This was an opportunity to purchase a beloved and enduring portfolio of intellectual property including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, James and the Giant Peach, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Twits, to name just a few. Roald Dahl's books have been translated into 63 languages and have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. Once we close, we'll be looking to develop even more of these stories into new formats across the live action television and films, animation and pre-school categories. We've begun testing our games offering in select countries. It remains very early days for this initiative and, like other content categories we've expanded into, we plan to try different types of games, learn from our members and improve our game library. During Q3, we acquired Night School Studio, the maker of critically acclaimed games like OXENFREE, to help build out our game development capabilities. 4 As a reminder, games on Netflix will be included in members' subscriptions and will not have advertisements or in-app purchases so game play is purely focused on enjoyment versus monetization. We're eagerly anticipating the rest of our Q4 slate, which includes a great mix of popular returning English language series like The Witcher, You, Tiger King and Cobra Kai, big returning non-English series like Sintonia and the final chapter of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), as well as exciting new movies such as the action film Red Notice (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds), Don't Look Up with an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep, as well as The Harder They Fall featuring Jonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, LaKeith Stanfield, Regina King and Idris Elba, Army of Thieves (the prequel to our hit movie, Army of the Dead) and The Unforgivable starring Sandra Bullock, Viola Davis and Jon Bernthal. The latest films from acclaimed directors Jane Campion (The Power Of The Dog) and Paolo Sorrentino (The Hand of God) are also coming to Netflix in Q4. Assuming no new Covid waves or unforeseen events that result in large scale production shutdowns, we currently anticipate a more normalized content slate in 2022, with a greater number of originals in 2022 vs. 2021 and a release schedule that is more balanced over the course of the year, as compared to 2021. Product We try many different approaches to see what might help our growth. One example in Q3 was the launch of a free plan for mobile users in Kenya. This plan is a great way for anyone in Kenya with an Android mobile phone to explore Netflix - with access to great content, personalized recommendations, and parental controls. We hope that this encourages more people to sign up for a paid membership so that they can watch Netflix on any device (mobile, TV, or laptop), access more features (e.g. downloads) and enjoy our entire catalog. It will take a year or two to determine if this technique helps our paid membership growth or not. We know that members most value the variety and quality of our content. Great recommendations are key to ensuring they can experience that breadth and diversity. So we continue to invest in our recommendations to ensure members can easily find great stories to enjoy on our service. One example of our ability to surface relevant programming is Manifest, a TV series that aired on NBC for three seasons and was subsequently cancelled in June 2021. We added Manifest to our service in the US and Canada during the summer of 2021. In the UCAN region, 25m member households chose to watch this title in its first 28 days and we've ordered a fourth and final season given the popularity of the show. Marketing & Communications In addition to having best in class content and a product experience that allows members to easily find shows and movies they love, we also want our programming to be talked about and in the cultural zeitgeist. In September, we held our first global fan event, TUDUM, which featured news, first looks and trailers from over 100 of the most anticipated Netflix films and series of the next 12 months. TUDUM was a new way for us to connect fans with our titles, talent and brand and to drive conversation at a global scale and trended at #2 globally the day of the event on Twitter. Additionally, TUDUM and the 5 trailers\/content released following the event were watched by fans in over 180 countries, generating close to 700m views and more than 3 billion impressions in less than four days. Competition We compete with a staggeringly large set of activities for consumers' time and attention like watching linear TV, reading a book, browsing TikTok, or playing Fortnite, to name just a few. As one example of this dynamic, on October 4, when Facebook experienced a global outage for several hours, our engagement saw a 14% increase during this time period. We are still quite small, with a lot of opportunity for growth; in our largest and most penetrated market, according to Nielsen, we are still less than 10% of US television screen time. Our approach as always is to improve our service as quickly as we can so that we can earn a greater share of people's time. Share of Total US TV Time, September 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $82 million vs. $1.3 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was -$106 million vs. $1.1 billion in Q3'20. FCF in last year's 2 Q3 was helped by COVID-related production shutdowns. Year to date FCF is $410m. With production volume ramping successfully and a lower operating margin in Q4, we anticipate Q4 '21 FCF to be negative. We continue to expect full year 2021 FCF to be approximately breakeven (plus or minus several hundred million dollars depending on the timing of production starts and related cash spending on content). We anticipate being FCF positive on an annual basis in 2022 and beyond. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6 As we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repurchased 0.2m shares for $100 million. Our slower buyback pace this quarter reflects the pick up in our M&A activity. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above and beyond our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In March, we committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022 and to reduce our emissions to be in line with the latest climate science, ensuring that our internal reductions are consistent with a trajectory of no more than 1.5℃ of warming. We've been making progress on this initiative. We provided an update in September here.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: In Q3, we grew to $5.2 billion in revenue, up 31% over the prior year, and operating income doubled to $1.0 billion. Paid net adds totaled 6.8m compared to our 7.0m forecast and prior year Q3 of 6.1m. As we've improved the variety, diversity and quality of our content slate, member engagement has grown, revenue has increased, and we're able to further fund our content investment. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast In Q3'19, average streaming paid memberships and ARPU grew 22% and 9% year over year, respectively. Excluding a -$137m year over year impact from F\/X, consolidated revenue growth was 35%, while streaming ARPU growth was 12%. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above our guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. EPS amounted to $1.47 vs. $0.89 and included a $171 million non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Our Euro bonds provide us with a small natural hedge for our growing European revenues. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, our guidance forecast was our most accurate in recent history. 1In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. On a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a meaningful impact on paid net adds. However, revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. With more revenue, we'll continue to invest to improve our service to further strengthen our value proposition. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F\/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress. For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. As we outline in more detail below, our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. 2We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. As we've said previously, large swings in F\/X could lead to some variations from our steady annual margin progression, partially because we don't buy derivatives to hedge our F\/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars. Content We strive to program Netflix with the best variety of high quality content across many genres (scripted series, films, docs, comedy specials, unscripted TV, kids & family, anime, etc.). Our ambitious approach reflects our goal to satisfy the entertainment desires of our 158m-plus members and to attract as many of the hundreds of millions of non-members as we can. To accomplish this, we need great breadth of quality content because people have very diverse tastes. If you think about your own habits, you'll recognize that what you want to watch on a Friday night may differ from what you want to watch on Tuesday after a long day of work or what you want to watch with your family on Saturday morning or what you want to watch with your friends on Sunday afternoon. Now, multiply that by the billions of people on the planet and all the other factors that affect viewing preferences and you will have a sense of the breadth of programming necessary to be as successful as we desire. We have been moving increasingly to original content both because of the anticipated pullback of second run content from some studios and because our original content is working in the form of member viewing and engagement. We started first with English scripted TV series more than six years ago to great success. We continued in Q3 with Stranger Things Season 3 (the most watched season to   date with 64m member households in its first four weeks). We also introduced new limited series like 3Unbelievable, one of our most thought provoking and highly viewed dramas (watched by 32m member  households in its first 28 days). We're expanding our non-English language original offerings because they continue to help grow our penetration in international markets. In Q3, Season 3 of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist) became the     most watched show on Netflix across our non-English language territories with 44m households watching the new season in the first four weeks of release. Sintonia, our latest Brazilian original, was the   second most watched inaugural season in Brazil. The Naked Director broke out as the biggest title launch   for us in Japan and was also highly successful throughout Asia. Similarly, in India, we debuted the second season of Sacred Games, our most watched show in India. To date, we have globally released 100   seasons of local language, original scripted series from 17 countries and have plans for over 130 more in 2020. We also plan to expand our investment in local language original films and unscripted series. We're also investing aggressively in original films and making great progress with improving results. Our original film slate in Q3 featured several solid hits like Secret Obsession (starring Brenda Song) and   Otherhood (directed by Cindy Chupack in her feature directorial debut), which were watched by 40  million and 29 million households in their first four weeks, respectively. Tall Girl, a new family film   starring Ava Michelle, was also a success with 41m households watching in the first 28 days. We expect that our Q4 film releases will continue to build and strengthen our film effort. Q4 film releases include Martin Scorsese's The Irishman (with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci), Marriage Story (starring     Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and The Two Popes (featuring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan   Pryce), all of which have emerged as early Oscar frontrunners. We also have several big releases such as Dolemite is My Name (starring Eddie Murphy and featuring a breakout performance from Da'Vine Joy   Randolph), 6 Underground (directed by Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds), The Laundromat, from      director Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman and The King (starring Timothée    Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton) as well as animated features Klaus and I Lost My Body.     Our goal is to have the quality of our slate rival the ambition of its scope. An example is Orange is the  New Black, which wrapped its final new season in Q3. The show was celebrated by fans and the media  for the groundbreaking role it played for Netflix and the culture at large; Time Magazine said ...'Orange is the New Black' is the most important TV show of the decade. Our very popular Ozark,   Our Planet, Queer Eye, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and When They See Us led 40 Netflix original series    and films to a record 117 Emmy Nominations and 27 wins in 2019. With so many firms now looking to provide premium video content to consumers, it's a great time to be a creator of content. Amazing content can be expensive. We don't shy away from taking bold swings if we think the business impact will also be amazing. We don't close every deal we chase and we don't chase every deal on the table. And while not all projects that we do pursue will work out, our large and growing subscription base helps enable us to try many approaches, while the size of our content budget (~$10 billion on P&L spend and ~$15 billion in cash content spend in 2019) insulates us from dependency on any single title. We'll continue to learn as we go, while staying disciplined by assessing each opportunity individually, steadily marching up our operating margin and improving free cash flow. 4Product and Partnerships We seek to make it easier for future members to sign up and enjoy Netflix. To that end, we rolled out a lower priced mobile plan in India in July and we're pleased with the results. Our approach with pricing is to grow revenue and so far, uptake and retention on our mobile plan in India has been better than our initial testing suggested. This will allow us to invest more in Indian content to further satisfy our members. While still only a very small percentage of our total subscriber base, we're continuing to test mobile-only plans in other markets. We continued to expand our partner-based bundle offerings, adding bundles with Sky Italia, Canal+ in France, KDDI in Japan and Izzi in Mexico this quarter. We just localized our service in Vietnamese, Hungarian and Czech so that more entertainment fans can enjoy thousands of hours of TV shows and films in their preferred language. We'll continue to expand language coverage and accessibility. Competition We compete broadly for entertainment time. This means there are many competitive activities to Netflix (from watching linear TV to playing video games, for example). But there is also a very large market opportunity; today we believe we're less than 10% of TV screen time in the US (our most mature market) and much less than that in mobile screen time. Many are focused on the streaming wars, but we've been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade. The upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV. While the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world. The launch of these new services will be noisy. There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. By way of example, our growth in Canada, where Hulu does not exist, is nearly identical to our growth in the US (where Hulu is very successful at about 30 million paid memberships). Our penetration in both markets below: 5We believe this is due to the big factor of streaming growing into linear TV plus the fact that streaming video services have mostly exclusive content libraries that make them highly differentiated from one another. In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and Discovery didn't take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience share from broadcast viewing. Content creation is booming around the world and everyone is vying for consumer attention. Over the next 10 years, many streaming services will grow viewing as streaming replaces linear TV. Our focus will continue to be on pleasing our members and growing engagement because that approach has served us well since 1997. Total viewing, as measured by various 3rd parties, is the best indicator of our relative success since it's a signal of customer satisfaction, and few of the services will disclose streaming video revenue, and subscriber figures are hard to interpret (given bundles, discounts and other promotions). Our focused approach to date has driven meaningful growth in our membership base and engagement. We did well during the first decade of streaming. We've been preparing for this new wave of competition for a long time. It's why we started investing in originals in 2012 and expanded aggressively ever since - across programming categories and countries with an ambition to share stories from the world to the world. In Q4, with The Crown, The Witcher, Klaus, The Irishman, The Two Popes, 6            Underground, and many other amazing titles launching, we're ready to compete to earn consumers'  attention and viewing. 6Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q3'19 was -$502 million vs. -$690 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 in Q3 totaled -$551 million vs. -$859 million in Q3'18. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. As we move slowly toward FCF positive, our plan is to continue to use the high yield market in the interim to finance our investment needs. Next Year Reporting Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region, which is how we think about our business. Our four regions are Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM), and the US and Canada (UCAN). UCAN is roughly 90% US and 10% Canada. Under this new reporting format, we'll only provide membership guidance for global paid memberships for the next quarter with each earnings report.  As we self-produce and license more original content that has global rights, we are finding US vs. international segment contribution margin reporting is becoming less useful internally. We'll stop reporting on it in January 2020 and continue to focus on global operating margin as our primary profitability metric. As a reminder, we'll no longer report free trial members beginning in 2020 as we informed you in our Q3'18 investor letter.   1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 7    Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: July 2019, April 2019, January 2019,   October 2018, July 2018, April 2018, January 2018, October 2017.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  8    that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding pricing; investments in our service; future content  offerings and approach to accessing content; investment in local language original films and unscripted  series; evolution of streaming video services; product tests and changes; impact of and reaction to  competition; future capital raises; U.S. and international streaming paid memberships, paid net  additions, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin; consolidated revenue, revenue  growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; free cash flow; and  changes to earnings reports. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K\/A, filed with the SEC on February 8,  2019.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Fellow shareholders,    In Q3, quarterly global streaming revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time (up 36% year over year),  helped by our strong content slate including Stranger Things and the second season of Narcos. On a  constant currency basis, this represents 39% year-over-year revenue growth, a 400 basis point  acceleration from the last two quarters. Our summary results and forecast are below:             1  Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Global streaming revenue totaled $2.2 billion, of which 40% was generated abroad. Operating income  amounted to $106 million (compared with our $64 million estimate) while net income was $52 million  (vs. forecast of $22 million).   In Q3, we added 0.4 million members in the US vs. our forecast of 0.3 million and 3.2 million members  internationally vs. our forecast of 2.0 million.  Our over-performance against forecast (86.7m total  streaming members vs. forecast of 85.5m) was driven primarily by stronger than expected acquisition  due to excitement around Netflix original content.   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report  and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, we under forecasted member growth, while in Q2, it was the opposite.  For the first nine months of 2016, we've added 12 million global members, the same as in the first nine  months of 2015.  By the end of Q3'16, we had un-grandfathered 75% of the members that are being un-grandfathered  this year and the impact has been consistent with our expectations. ASP grew over 10% year-over-year  in both the US and international segments (excluding a $35 million F\/X impact). With more revenue, we  can reinvest to further improve Netflix to attract new members from around the world, while continuing  to delight our existing customers.   Domestically, revenue rose 23% year over year, 480 basis points faster than Q2. US marketing expense  rose as a percentage of revenue as we spent to build awareness for our expanding number of original  titles. US contribution profit increased 38% year-over-year with contribution margin expanding to 36%,  slightly ahead of our 35% forecast.  In the international segment, we exceeded our internal projection for net adds as the acquisition impact  of our originals was greater than anticipated across many of our markets. F\/X-neutral revenue rose 72%  and international contribution loss was flat sequentially at $69 million as content costs came in under  our forecast due partly to timing. We are investing in more content across multiple international  markets in Q4 and, as a result, we project international contribution loss to grow moderately to $75  million.   In September, we localized Netflix in Poland and Turkey. We began accepting payment in local currency  and added a local language user interface, subtitles and dubbing as well as some local content. We have  seen nice gains in viewing and retention and we'll undertake other localization efforts in the coming  months and years.   For Q4, we forecast 5.2 million global net adds, with 1.45 million net adds in the US and 3.75 million new  members internationally. Our expectation for a moderate year-over-year decline in net adds reflects the  completion of un-grandfathering. We are pleased with the results thus far as we expect ASP to grow  12% from Q1'16 to Q4'16. Internationally, the initial demand from our launch in Spain, Portugal and Italy  in Q4'15 will also affect our year-over-year net adds comparison.   2  We will face a tough international net adds comparison in Q1'17 because of the initial membership  surge in Q1'16 tied to the launch of 130 additional territories.  As discussed, for the balance of 2016, we will continue to operate around break even, and then start  generating material global profits in 2017 and beyond, by marching up operating margins steadily for  many years.  Content  We kicked off Q3 with the release of Stranger Things on July 15 to both critical and audience acclaim.  This nostalgic, supernatural thriller proved to be the blockbuster of the summer and is the kind of broad  appeal, cross demographic, and cross border sensation that we hope will distinguish Netflix original  content. Stranger Things is also notable as it is produced and owned by Netflix, which provides us with  more attractive economics and greater business and creative control. In August, we launched The Get  Down, a highly stylized drama set in 1970s New York City, detailing the origins of hip-hop. We look  forward to releasing part two of season one next year.   Our hit series Narcos returned for season two in September to great success among critics and  audiences alike. Narcos had a positive impact on member acquisition across all of our markets,  demonstrating the ability for our tentpole franchises to connect with audiences across the world. We  closed the quarter with Marvel's Luke Cage, the latest installment in our Marvel series, which will  continue with Iron Fist on March 17, 2017. We are also looking forward next year to The Defenders, a  team-up of the characters from our first four Marvel series.   We are now in the fourth year of our original content strategy and are pleased with our progress. In  2017, we intend to release over 1,000 hours of premium original programming, up from over 600 hours  this year. The Internet allows us to reach audiences all over the world and, with a growing base of over  86 million members, there's a large appetite for entertainment and a diversity of tastes to satisfy.   We are fortunate that our Internet-centric, on-demand, subscription-only business model allows us to  support programs for both mass and niche audiences alike. Our personalization algorithms help us  promote the right content to the right viewers. And since we are not shelf-space constrained nor reliant  on advertising, we have the luxury to tell all kinds of stories in less traditional ways. The growth of  Internet TV globally has ushered in a new golden age of content, with consumers everywhere enjoying  unprecedented access to amazing amounts of high quality programming.   With an expanding content budget (approximately $6 billion in 2017 on a P&L basis), we judge the  success of our portfolio of originals in several ways. For each series or film, we measure the impact on  acquisition and member engagement which, in turn, is correlated with retention. To determine relative  performance, we look at each title's share of viewing compared with its share of our content budget. We  also take into account qualitative factors such as earned media coverage and awards, which enhance  our brand and our ability to attract talent for future projects. This year, we are thrilled to have won nine  Emmys (out of 54 nominations) across six different shows.   3  This past quarter, we announced a global pact with 20th Century Fox Studios to license The People vs.  O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story and Queen of the South and an agreement with The Walt Disney Co.  to license Quantico and American Crime in the US and Canada. We are also increasingly ensuring early  financing and sharing windows globally with original broadcasters for series like Star Trek: Discovery  from CBS, The Alienist from Paramount TV and the just-launched  ABC series Designated Survivor from  eOne.  Product and Partnerships  We continue to make progress with our MVPD partnerships. We are excited that the Netflix app will be  available across Liberty Global's footprint beginning in the Netherlands later this year and expanding to  other countries in 2017. Partnerships like this and our integration on X1 with Comcast validate the  strength of our content and that we are additive to the current offerings of MVPDs. By working  together, MVPDs can sell richer Internet and TV packages, while consumers can more easily sign up for  and access Netflix, thus allowing Netflix and our partners to better serve our shared customers.  China  The regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging. We  now plan to license content to existing online service providers in China rather than operate our own  service in China in the near term. We expect revenue from this licensing will be modest. We still have a  long term desire to serve the Chinese people directly, and hope to launch our service in China  eventually.   Competition  We face immense competition for consumer screen time. Despite video gaming getting better, video  messaging and sharing improving, MVPD UI enhancements, YouTube growth, more SVOD services, and  other screen time competitors, Netflix continues to win both time and affection. We presume that  Amazon Prime Video will become as global as YouTube and Netflix this fall with the launch of the Jeremy  Clarkson show.  Our challenge is to continue to improve our service and content so that we better meet  consumer desires. Total screen time is quite large and growing as technology and content improve  globally.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q3, free cash flow was -$506 million vs. -$254 million in Q2'16 and -$252 million in the year ago  quarter. The increase in our free cash flow deficit reflects the growth of original content, which we are  increasingly producing and owning (rather than licensing). Self-produced shows like Stranger Things  require more cash upfront as we incur spending during the creation of each show prior to its completion  and release. In comparison, we generally pay on delivery for licensed originals like Orange is the New  Black and we pay over the term of the agreement for licensed non-originals (eg, Scandal).    4  Over the long run, we believe self-producing is less expensive (including cost of capital) than licensing a  series or film, as we work directly with the creative community and eliminate additional overhead and  fees. In addition, we own the underlying intellectual property, providing us with global rights and more  business and creative control. Combined with the success of our portfolio of originals and the positive  impact on our member and revenue growth, we believe this is a wise investment that creates long term  value. Consequently, we plan on investing more, which will continue to weigh on free cash flow. We  expect Q4'16 FCF to be similar to Q3'16 FCF. Over time, we will be able to fund more of our investment  in programming through the growth in operating profit and margin already underway.  Streaming content obligations at quarter end were $14.4 billion, up $1 billion sequentially. The increase  reflects the addition of both new original and non-original content to our library as well as expanded  rights for our new territories.   We finished the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents. As we have often done over the past  few years, we plan to raise additional debt in the coming weeks. With a debt to total capitalization ratio  of about 5%, we remain underleveraged compared both to similar firms and to our view of an efficient  capital structure. Our 2025 bonds continue to trade well.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measure  of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves provides useful information as  this measure excludes effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes  that the non-GAAP financial measures of revenue and ASP growth on a constant currency basis are  useful in assessing underlying business performance excluding the effect of foreign currency rate  fluctuations.  Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics  because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay  debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, revenue,  operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other  financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: We strive to entertain and to bring joy to people across the world through amazing stories. Our 125 million members provided us with $3.6 billion in streaming revenue in Q1. Our job is to spend this money wisely to increase our members' delight. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Revenue grew 43% year over year in Q1, the fastest pace in the history of our streaming business, due to a 25% increase in average paid streaming memberships and a 14% rise in ASP. Operating margin of 12% rose 232 bps year over year. This was higher than our beginning of quarter guidance, due primarily to the timing of content spend. Diluted EPS of $0.64 vs. $0.40 included a $41m non-cash unrealized loss from F\/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. Global net adds totaled a new Q1-record of 7.41m, up 50% year over year and ahead of our 6.35m forecast. The variance relative to our guidance was driven by continued strong acquisition trends across the globe which we attribute to the growing breadth of our content and the worldwide adoption of internet entertainment. In the US, we added 1.96m memberships (compared with forecast of 1.45m). We completed our price adjustment during this past quarter, resulting in 12% ASP growth for the domestic segment. Outside of the US, membership grew by 5.46m (vs. forecast of 4.90m). Our international segment now accounts for 50% of revenue and 55% of memberships. Excluding a F\/X impact of +$114 million, international revenue and ASP rose 59% and 13% year over year, respectively. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2, we expect 6.2 million global net additions (1.2m in the US and 5.0m for the international segment) vs. 5.2 million in the year ago quarter. Q2 operating margin is expected to be 12%. We are now targeting a full year operating margin of 10%-11%. We continue to anticipate content and marketing spend to be weighted towards the second half of 2018. Content We'll have $7.5-$8 billion of content expense (on a P&L basis) in 2018 across a wide variety of formats (series, films, unscripted, docs, comedy specials, non-English language) to serve the diverse tastes of our growing global membership base. Q1 scripted original series debuts included the dark, coming of age story The End of the F***ing World  and sci-fi thriller Altered Carbon as well as returning seasons of Marvel's Jessica Jones, Grace and       Frankie, Santa Clarita Diet and A Series of Unfortunate Events.    Last year, we expanded our efforts in original programming to unscripted shows across several genres. Our output in this area is now comparable to similarly-focused US domestic cable networks. Shows like Queer Eye and Nailed It are great examples of our ambitions in this area: engaging, buzz-worthy shows    that drive lots of enjoyment around the world. Our investment in international production continued to increase with big, non-English originals like O  Mecanismo (The Mechanism). Loosely inspired by real events and from Narcos creator José Padilha, this    drama is tracking to be one of our most viewed originals in Brazil. We are also seeing more examples of non-English content transcending borders. This quarter, La Casa de Papel (Money Heist in English     2language territories), a Spanish language heist thriller, became the most watched non-English series on Netflix ever. On Super Bowl Sunday, we surprise-announced and launched The Cloverfield Paradox, the third film in   the Cloverfield franchise. Through tight coordination among our original film, product, marketing and PR   teams, the event showcased how a big branded film can be marketed and delivered to consumers instantaneously across the globe without a wait for the theatrical window. Outside of North America, we premiered the Alex Garland-directed Annihilation, starring Natalie Portman, just weeks after its US   theatrical debut and it has enjoyed large audiences in nearly every country for us. We also released a broad range of original films: from Benji for kids and families; to the Seth Rogen\/Evan Goldberg   produced comedy Game Over, Man; to the Sundance hip-hop biopic Roxanne, Roxanne.     We regret our films not being able to compete at this year's Cannes film festival. The festival adopted a new rule that means if a film is in competition at Cannes, it can not be watched on Netflix in France for the following three years1. We would never want to do that to our French members. We will continue to celebrate our films and filmmakers at other festivals around the world but unfortunately we will have to sit out Cannes for now so that our growing French membership can continue to enjoy our original films. This past quarter, we signed an overall deal with Ryan Murphy, the prolific hit-maker behind American  Crime Story: The People vs. OJ Simpson, Nip\/Tuck, Glee, American Horror Story and many others. This        comes on the heels of similar partnerships with Shonda Rhimes, Shawn Levy and Jenji Kohan. While these overall deals are a substantial investment for us, they allow us to work directly with prolific and talented creators with a proven track record of success. Instead of having to license their shows for a finite period from outside suppliers, we will own the projects we produce with them. This approach also allows us to reduce our reliance on third-party studios and forego the corresponding license premiums we've historically paid. We were proud to celebrate our first feature Academy Award with Bryan Fogel and Dan Cogan, makers of our documentary Icarus. We're thrilled when the creators with whom we partner are recognized for   their exceptional work. The Oscar win helps to reinforce that Netflix is a great home for both documentary lovers and creators. Marketing We're investing in more marketing of new original titles to create more density of viewing and conversation around each title (i.e bigger hit in a nation or demographic). We believe this density of viewing helps on both retention and acquisition, because it makes our original titles even less substitutable. Because we operate in so many countries, we are able to try different approaches in different markets, and continue to learn. 1 Specifically, the Cannes festival's new rule is that a French theatrical opening is required of films in competition, and French  law in essence requires that if a film is in French theatres, then it cannot be on an SVOD service in France for 36 months. While in other countries we can offer simultaneous exhibition in theatres and on Netflix, that is not permitted in France, so we have to be Netflix-only for our films in France. 3Product and Partnerships Last year, we launched bundle offers with Proximus (in Belgium), SFR Altice (France) and T-Mobile (US). They have proven to be very successful and we are now adding similar bundle offers with additional MVPD partners. Recently, we announced that we are bundling the Netflix service with packages from Sky which will begin later this year and with Comcast in the US, which are currently being rolled out. These relationships allow our partners to attract more customers and to upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while we benefit from more reach, awareness and often, less friction in the signup and payment process. We believe that the lower churn in these bundles offsets the lower Netflix ASP. We remain primarily a direct-to-consumer business, but we see our bundling initiative as an attractive supplemental channel. In March, we rolled out additional features providing members with greater information and control   over their Netflix viewing. While we had already offered PIN protection for all content at a certain maturity level, there is now a parental PIN control for individual movies and shows. These new features are part of our ongoing effort to give our members tools to manage how they and their families enjoy Netflix. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q1 was -$287 million (less negative than we expected due to content payment timing differences), compared with -$524 million in Q4'17. We continue to forecast free cash flow of -$3 to -$4 billion in 2018, and to be free cash flow negative for several more years as our original content spend rapidly grows. We have about $2.6 billion in cash and we will continue to raise debt as needed to fund our increase in original content. Our debt levels are quite modest as a percentage of our enterprise value, and we believe the debt is lower cost of capital compared to equity. Board of Directors We're pleased to add Ambassador Susan Rice to our board of directors. Susan is a former National   Security Advisor and United States Ambassador to the United Nations. As a global company operating in over 190 countries, Susan's expertise in international affairs will be valuable.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding content and marketing spend and strategy, including  outside the US; content performance; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total and  paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic  international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income,  earnings per share and free cash flow.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  5  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K\/A, filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 5, 2018. The Company provides internal  forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast  numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as  amended by Form 10-K\/A. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect  events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.      6      7 Netflix, Inc.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Revenue surpassed $4.5 billion in Q1 and we recorded the highest quarterly paid net adds in our history (9.6m, up 16% year over year). For 20 years, we've had the same strategy: when we please our members, they watch more and we grow more. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast In Q1'19, average streaming paid memberships increased 26% year over year, while ARPU decreased 2% year over year due to currency headwinds. Excluding F\/X, global streaming ARPU improved 3% year over year and 2% sequentially. Year over year total revenue growth of 22% compares against 40% in Q1'18, which benefited from several price changes that took place in Q4'17 as well as F\/X. On a F\/X-neutral basis, Q1'19 revenue grew 28% year over year. Operating margin of 10.2% exceeded our beginning-of-quarter expectation as some spending was shifted from Q1 to later in the year. EPS of $0.76, vs. $0.64 in the prior year period, included a $58 million non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming content obligations dipped sequentially in Q1 due in part to the timing of run-of-series commitments. In addition, as we shift to more original content, there will be greater variability in content obligations 1quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of when productions start. We early-adopted the new content accounting standard (ASU 2019-2) in Q1'19. There is no material impact as our content accounting policies are already consistent with the new rules. Paid net adds in Q1 were 9.6 million (with 1.74m in the US and 7.86m internationally), up 16% year over year, representing a new quarterly record. As always, our quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2'19, we project total paid net adds of 5.0m (-8% year over year), with 0.3m in the US and 4.7m for the international segment. This would put us at 14.6m paid net adds for the first half of 2019, up 7% year over year. We're working our way through a series of price increases in the US, Brazil, Mexico and parts of Europe. The response in the US so far is as we expected and is tracking similarly to what we saw in Canada following our Q4'18 increase, where our gross additions are unaffected, and we see some modest short-term churn effect as members consent to the price change. We're looking forward to a strong slate of global content in the second half of the year, including new seasons of some of our biggest series, Stranger Things (July 4th), 13 Reasons Why, Orange is the New Black, The Crown and La Casa de         Papel (aka Money Heist) as well as big films like Michael Bay's Six Underground and Martin Scorsese's      The Irishman, and expect another year of record annual paid net adds in 2019.  We forecast an acceleration in both streaming ARPU (+2% vs. -2%) and total revenue growth (26% vs. 22%) in Q2 vs. Q1. Excluding currency, we forecast streaming ARPU and total revenue would rise 7% and 32%, respectively in Q2. While there will be some quarter-to-quarter lumpiness in operating margins due to the timing of spending, our full year 2019 operating margin target of 13% is unchanged, which means that we expect operating margin in the second half of the year will be higher than the first half. 2As a result of US tax reform, we took the opportunity to simplify our corporate structure. This will result in a higher effective tax rate in 2019, including an expected effective tax rate of 48% in Q2'19 due to one time discrete events. Longer term, we expect our effective tax rate to trend down toward U.S. federal rates. Content We program Netflix with a wide breadth of content to satisfy the diverse tastes of our nearly 150m paid members and the hundreds of millions of people we hope will one day join Netflix. We continue to see big successes across our programming categories. For Q1'19, in scripted English language TV, we premiered another big hit in Umbrella Academy, based on the comic book by Gerard Way and Gabriel   Bá, which has been watched by 45 million member households in its first four weeks on service. Our original films effort built on the momentum from our Q4 blockbuster Bird Box with Triple Frontier,     starring Ben Affleck and directed by J.C. Chandor. This action\/heist movie has been watched by over 52 million member households in its first four weeks on Netflix. The Highwaymen (starring Kevin Costner   and Woody Harrelson as two lawmen that bring Bonnie and Clyde to justice) is on track to being watched by over 40 million member households in its first month. Our documentary feature FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened has been watched by over 20   million member households in its first month on Netflix. In early April, we unveiled Our Planet, our most   ambitious entry into the popular nature documentary genre. More than four years in the making and shot in 50 different countries, Our Planet is off to a strong start and is tracking to be one of our most   successful global documentary series launches yet, with over 25 million member households projected to watch in the first month of release. We launched our originals effort for the unscripted genre two years ago with several successful English-language formats like the light hearted cooking competition Nailed It!. We're building on that   success by launching locally adapted versions in Mexico, France, Germany and Spain. ¡Nailed It!: México  was the first and launched on February 8, achieving three times more first-month watchers in Mexico than the dubbed US version. Our non-English language originals continue to be successful for us and we recently announced that Bela Bajaria, who has overseen some of our most successful scripted and unscripted titles, will now lead this programming category for original series in LatAm, EMEA and India. We premiered our first large scale Korean original series, Kingdom, in January. This period piece with zombies is our most successful season   one show in Korea to date and has also been watched by millions of members outside of Korea with particularly strong viewing throughout Asia. Durante la Tormenta (aka Mirage) is a successful     Spanish-language original film that debuted in the quarter and has seen broad viewing across the world. We're thrilled for the creators of our content when they are recognized for their exceptional work. We're proud that last year Netflix became the most nominated network at the Emmys and now has tied to become the #2 most nominated studio at the Oscars; we tied for most wins in both, including major 3Oscar wins for Alfonso Cuarón for Best Director and Best Cinematographer for Roma, which also won for   Best Foreign Language Feature. Marketing Our CMO, Kelly Bennett, will be retiring this year after an amazing seven year run. During this time, Kelly was a key contributor to the transformation of Netflix from a primarily domestic service with only 2nd run content to a global service launching an unprecedented amount of original programming and we thank Kelly for his hard work. Ted Sarandos has led content for nearly 20 years here, and is ready to run both content and marketing, so he is leading the search for the new CMO, who will report to him. Product and Partnerships We've been expanding our bundling initiative and we are now distributing Netflix through ten different operator bundles across the globe. To date, these bundles have had a positive effect on our business, driving incremental acquisition at similar economics to other partnerships where Netflix is offered ȧ la carte. Later in Q2 we'll be running a test to improve our UK member experience by releasing weekly top 10 lists of the most popular content on our UK service across various programming categories. For those who want to watch what others are watching, this may make choosing titles even easier. After a few months we'll decide whether to end or expand the test. Competition Recently, Apple and Disney each unveiled their direct-to-consumer subscription video services. Both companies are world class consumer brands and we're excited to compete; the clear beneficiaries will be content creators and consumers who will reap the rewards of many companies vying to provide a great video experience for audiences. We don't anticipate that these new entrants will materially affect our growth because the transition from linear to on demand entertainment is so massive and because of the differing nature of our  content offerings. We believe we'll all continue to grow as we each invest more in content and improve  our service and as consumers continue to migrate away from linear viewing (similar to how US cable networks collectively grew for years as viewing shifted from broadcast networks during the 1980s and 1990s). We believe there is vast demand for watching great TV and movies and Netflix only satisfies a small portion of that demand. Last quarter, we talked about how our streaming hours in the US (our most   mature market) on TV still only represents roughly 10% of total TV usage. We are much smaller and have even more room to grow in other countries and on other devices like mobile. For instance, Sandvine estimates our share of global1 downstream mobile internet traffic is about 2%. 1 The Sandvine data does not include significant data from either China or India. 4Source: Sandvine, The Mobile Internet Phenomena Report (February 2019) Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q1'19 was -$380 million vs. -$237 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow2 totaled -$460 million vs. -$287 million in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, the gap between net income and free cash flow is primarily driven by our investment in originals and self produced content where the cash spending is more front end loaded than for second run licensed programming (where cash payments are generally spread over the term of the license). We now expect 2019 free cash flow deficit to be modestly higher at approximately -$3.5 billion due to higher cash taxes related to the change in our corporate structure and additional investments in real estate and other infrastructure. We're still expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 and each year thereafter, driven by our growing member base, revenues, and operating margins. There's no change to our plan to use the high yield market to finance our cash needs. We recently upsized our revolving credit facility from $500 million to $750 million (which remains undrawn) at the same cost and extended the term from 2022 to 2024.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  6  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding future content offerings; variability of content  obligations; product tests; impact of competition; future capital raises; ARPU; global streaming  membership growth; tax rate; impact of the change in corporate structure; U.S. and international  streaming paid memberships, paid net additions, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution  margin; consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and  earnings per share; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K\/A, filed with the SEC on February 8,  2019. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual  performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above  and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K\/A.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: The Internnet is transforming video eentertainmennt, stream by stream, conssumer by consumer, nation by nation. Ouur opportunitty is to be onee of the leadeers of this transformation with the bestt streaming vvideo subscriptiion service onn the planet. The last feww months, howwever, have bbeen difficult for shareholdders, employeees, and most uunfortunatelyy, many memmbers of Netflix. While wee dramaticallyy improved our $7.99 unlimited streamming service bby embracing new platformms, simplifyinng our user‐innterface, and more than doubbling domestiic spending on streaming ccontent over 2010, we greeatly upset many domesticc Netflix meembers with our significannt DVD‐related pricing changes, and to a lesser degree, with the proposed‐and‐now‐cancelled rebranding of our DVD service. In doing so, we've hurt oour hard‐earned reputation, and stalledd our domestiic growth. But our long‐terrm streamingg opportunityy is as compellling as ever annd we are mooving forward as quickly ass we can to reepair our repuutation and reeturn to growwth. 1DVD andd Streamingg We think that $7.99 foor unlimited sttreaming andd $7.99 for unnlimited DVD are both veryy aggressive llow prices, rellative to competition and tto the value oof the servicees, and they aare the right pplace for Netfflix to be in the long term. WWhat we misjuudged was hoow quickly to move there. We compouunded the problem wwith our lack of explanatioon about the rising cost of the expansioon of streaminng content, and steady DVVD costs, so thhat absent thhat explanatioon, many percceived us as ggreedy. Finally, we annouunced and then retracted a seeparate brand for DVD. WWhile this brannding incidennt further dennted our reputation, and causedd a temporaryy cancellationn surge, comppared to our price change,, its impact wwas relatively minor. Our pprimary issuee is many of our long‐term members fellt shocked byy the pricing changes, aand more of tthem have exxpressed thatt by cancellingg Netflix thann we expectedd. Because oof this, our revenue and prrofits in Q4 wwill be lower thhan we had aanticipated, bbut we'll remaain profitablee on a global bbasis. In Q1'112 we'll be lauunching in thee UK and Irelaand, as we haad planned. FFor a few quartters starting in Q1, we expect the costs of our entry into the UK aand Ireland wwill push us to be unprofitable on a global basis; that is, domestic profits will noot be large ennough to bothh cover internatioonal investmeents and pay ffor global G&&A and Technoology & Deveelopment. Aftter launchingg the UK and Ireeland, we will pause on oppening new innternational mmarkets until we return too global profitabiliity. We plan to do that byy increasing oour global streeaming subsccriber base faster than we increase oour costs. Investors and memberrs will be relieeved to know we are donee with pricing changes, andd that at $7.999 each for sstreaming andd DVD we cann move forwaard for a long time. Some inveestors have asked us abouut the combinnation or hybbrid offeringg in the U.S. In our currentt signup floow, we offer tthree choices: (a) streaminng only at $7.999, (b) DVD oonly at $7.99, and (c) both,, for $15.98. AAbout 7% of nnew memberss choose the $15.98 hybridd offering.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: In our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end. What's clear is the escalating human cost in terms of lost lives and lost jobs, with tens of millions of people now out of work. At Netflix, we're acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term. Like other home entertainment services, we're seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth. In our case, this is offset by a sharply stronger US dollar, depressing our international revenue, resulting in revenue-as-forecast. We expect viewing to decline and membership  growth to decelerate as home confinement ends, which we hope is soon. By helping people connect with stories they love, we are able to provide comfort and escape as well as a sense of community during this pandemic. So our focus has been on maintaining the quality of our service while our employees around the world adapt to working from home. For the most part, this has gone smoothly. Our product teams, for example, have been relatively unaffected. As a precaution, we have temporarily reduced the number of product innovations we try, while continuing to release features that we know will add meaningful value for our members, such as improved parental controls. However, we have seen significant disruption when it comes to customer support and content production. On the customer support side, we've now fixed most of our work-from-home challenges. In addition, we've taken on another 2,000 agents (all working remotely), so our customer service levels are almost fully restored despite the increased demand. When it comes to production, almost all filming has now been stopped globally, with the exception of a few countries like Korea and Iceland. This has been devastating for millions of workers in the TV and film industry - electricians, hair and make-up artists, carpenters and drivers who are often paid hourly wages and work project-to-project. In March, we created a $100 million fund to help with hardship in the industry, starting with the hardest   hit workers on our productions, where Netflix has the greatest responsibility. We will have paid these crews for about seven weeks, with the goal of providing a bridge until government safety nets kick in. In addition, we're donating $30 million to third parties and non-profits, providing emergency relief to out-of-work crew and cast across the broader TV and film industry in countries where we have a large production base. This includes donations of $1 million each to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation COVID-19 Disaster Fund, the   Motion Picture and Television Fund and the Actors Fund Emergency Assistance in the US, and $1 million    between the AFC and Fondation des Artistes in Canada. These are all well established hardship funds. In     1other countries where no such funds exist, we've been working to set them up, including in the UK (£1 million) with the British Film Institute, in Italy ( 1 million) with the Italian Film Commission, in France ( 1   €   € million) with Audiens, in Brazil (R$5 million) with the Brazilian Institute of Audiovisual Content, in Mexico     ($1 million) with the Mexican Academy of Film Arts and Sciences, in Spain (€1 million) with the Ministry      of Culture and Sport, Accion Cultural and the Film Academy and in the Netherlands (€1 million) with the    Netherlands Film Fund.  In total, we have committed to spend $150 million supporting the industry through this crisis. Netflix's culture is designed to empower decision making at all levels of the company. Throughout this crisis, our employees have been working tirelessly to maintain the quality of our service and to find quick, practical solutions to the problems Netflix and our partners face. For example, within two weeks of the shelter-in-place orders coming into effect in Los Angeles, most of our animation production team was back up and running, working from home. On the post production side, we've been able to get 200+ projects going remotely. Most of our series writers' rooms are operating virtually. However, we've been unable to create dubs in Italian and some other languages due to home confinement of our voice talent for a handful of titles launching in April and May. But we hope that with the help of guilds around the world, voice actors can be set up from home, ensuring that they can stay safe and continue to earn a living. Similar efforts are underway for both music and visual effects. This pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a strong Internet like never before. Over the years, we've invested heavily in Open Connect, a pioneering caching system that puts our library of content as close to members' homes as possible. This enables ISPs to run their networks more efficiently and at a lower cost. However, given the surge in internet use, networks in some countries have struggled to cope. In March, we were asked by a number of governments and ISPs to temporarily reduce the network traffic of our members. Using our Open Connect technology, our engineering team was able to respond immediately, reducing network use by 25 percent virtually overnight in those countries, while also   substantially maintaining the quality of our service, including in higher definition. We're now working with ISPs to help increase capacity so that we can lift these limitations as conditions improve. Netflix employees have been outstanding and to help them support their local communities, we've doubled our charitable match giving program for 2020. So for every $1 donated by our employees to an organization, we now donate an additional $2 to that organization. Last, and most important of all, we want to say thank you on behalf of all our employees to the heroic doctors, nurses and first responders fighting this pandemic on the frontlines and the grocery, restaurant and other essential workers who take risks to make sure our families are fed and taken care of. We are truly inspired and humbled by you. Our summary results for Q1 and our Q2 forecast can be found in the table below. 2Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Despite paid net additions that were higher than forecast, revenue was in-line with our guidance due to the appreciation in the US dollar vs. other currencies. Excluding a -$115m impact from F\/X, streaming ARPU grew 8% year over year. Operating margin of 16.6% (vs. 10.2% in the prior year quarter) was lower than our 18.0% forecast as we incurred $218m in incremental content costs due to paused productions and hardship fund commitments (a 3.8 percentage point impact to operating margin). There are three primary effects on our financial performance from the crisis. First, our membership growth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement. Second, our international revenue will be less than previously forecast due to the dollar rising sharply. Third, due to the production shutdown, some cash spending on content will be delayed, improving our free cash flow, and some title releases will be delayed, typically by a quarter. More on each of these three effects below. During the first two months of Q1, our membership growth was similar to the prior two years, including in UCAN. Then, with lockdown orders in many countries starting in March, many more households joined Netflix to enjoy entertainment. This timing of paid membership additions also affected our Q1'20 global streaming ARPU; this was the primary driver of the sequential decline in streaming ARPU as the revenue impact from these additions late in the quarter will be mostly felt in Q2'20 and beyond. Hopefully, progress against the virus will allow governments to lift the home confinement soon. As that happens, we expect viewing and growth to decline. Our internal forecast and guidance is for 7.5 million global paid net additions in Q2. Given the uncertainty on home confinement timing, this is mostly guesswork. The actual Q2 numbers could end up well below or well above that, depending on many 3factors including when people can go back to their social lives in various countries and how much people take a break from television after the lockdown. Some of the lockdown growth will turn out to be pull-forward from the multi-year organic growth trend, resulting in slower growth after the lockdown is lifted country-by-country. Intuitively, the person who didn't join Netflix during the entire confinement is not likely to join soon after the confinement. Plus, last year we had new seasons of Money Heist and   Stranger Things in Q3, which were not planned for this year's Q3. Therefore, we currently guess that  Q3'20 and Q4'20 will have lower net additions than last year due to these effects. Second, partially due to the crisis, the US dollar has appreciated significantly, which creates a drag on international revenue growth. As an example, the price for our standard plan in Brazil is R$33, which used to be $8.5 last year but now is $6.5 based on April 2020 F\/X rates, so we have a ~25% decline in US dollar average subscription price from Brazil, which offsets strong membership growth. Third, we've paused most of our productions across the world in response to government lockdowns and guidance from local public health officials. In Q2, there is only a modest impact on our new releases, which is primarily language dubbing. No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages, and post-production) will play out. The impact on us is less cash spending this year as some content projects are pushed out. We are working hard to complete the content we know our members want and we're complementing this effort with additional licensed films and series. Our content competitors and suppliers will be impacted about as much as we are, in terms of new titles. Since we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our member satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers' by a shortage of new content, but it will take time to tell. We continue to target a 16% operating margin for the full year 2020, despite the extra costs in Q1. As a reminder, more than half of our revenue is not denominated in US dollars and we don't hedge our foreign exchange exposure. If the US dollar remains at these elevated levels (or strengthens further), we may target modestly slower growth in our annual operating margin progression next year. Given that lead time, we believe we can readjust our model to be appropriate in that new stronger US dollar world. Content As people shelter at home, our hope is that we can help make that experience more bearable by providing a diverse range of high quality content for our members. While our productions are largely paused around the world, we benefit from a large pipeline of content that was either complete and ready for launch or in post-production when filming stopped. For Q2, we're looking forward to releasing all of our originally planned shows and films (with some language dubbing impacts on a few titles). We're also finding ways to bolster our programming this year - including the recent acquisition of Paramount's and Media Rights Capital's The Lovebirds, a comedy   starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, for Q2'20 and Legendary Pictures' Enola Holmes starring Millie   Bobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin, for Q3 '20. So, while we're certainly 4impacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety of new titles throughout 2020 and 2021. Our Q1 slate highlighted the variety of content that people enjoy en masse all over the world on Netflix: scripted English language series like Ozark season 3 (a projected 29m member households will have   chosen to watch this season in its first four weeks), the riveting docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem  and Madness (64m), our breakthrough unscripted dating show Love is Blind (30m), original film Spenser     Confidential (85m), and season four of the Spanish language hit La Casa de Papel, aka Money Heist (a      projected 65m), which debuted in early April. In Q2, we are looking forward to the launch of Space Force, our new original comedy series created by   Greg Daniels (The Office) and Steve Carell, starring Carell, John Malkovich and Lisa Kudrow. We just   launched our latest buzzy unscripted series Too Hot to Handle, #BlackAF from Kenya Barris and, outside    the US, the Michael Jordan documentary The Last Dance, which we co-produced with ESPN (launching   on Netflix in the US on July 19). We will also premiere Hollywood from Ryan Murphy, and, later this     week, Extraction, a large scale action film starring Chris Hemsworth and directed by Sam Hargrave, who   was the stunt coordinator and choreographer on films like Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War,  Deadpool 2, and Captain America: Civil War.   Product In February, we rolled out our Top 10 most popular lists to nearly 100 countries, after testing this   feature last year in the UK and Mexico. In each of these countries, there are now three daily lists: Top 10 overall, Top 10 series and Top 10 films. Our goal with this feature is to help members find great TV shows and films and enable them to be part of the cultural zeitgeist in their country. Recently, we've also enhanced our parental controls for our service to improve the experience for family members of all ages. Updates include (i) PIN-controlled access to content by maturity level; (ii) the   ability to PIN protect specific titles as well as profiles; (iii) Profile-level content filtering; (iv) the ability to create kids' experiences that can be customized for different age groups ('teens and below,' 'older kids and below' and 'little kids'); and (v) the ability to disable post-play for kids from account settings. Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q1, net cash used in operating activities was +$260 million vs. -$380 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 totaled +$162 million compared with -$460 million in the year ago quarter. As we stated last quarter, our FCF profile is beginning to improve due to growing operating margin and profits and as we digest our big move into the production of Netflix originals (which requires more cash upfront vs. later-window content) that started five years ago. With our productions currently paused, this will shift out some cash spending on content to future years. As a result, we're now expecting 2020 FCF of -$1 billion or better (compared with our prior 2020 expectation of -$2.5 billion and -$3.3 billion actual in 2019). This dynamic may result in more lumpiness 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5in our path to sustained FCF profitability (as, prior to the pandemic, we had been planning for annual improvement in FCF). However, there has been no material change to our overall time table to reach consistent annual positive FCF and we believe that 2019 will still represent the peak in our annual FCF deficit. We finished the quarter with cash of $5.2 billion, while our $750m unsecured credit facility remains undrawn. Combined with our improved FCF outlook for 2020, we have more than 12 months of liquidity and substantial financial flexibility. Our financing strategy remains unchanged - our current plan is to continue to use debt to finance our investment needs.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.  Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding the business impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19)  pandemic, including on viewing hours, membership growth, new content releases including delays and  impact of delays on consumers, restarting production and post-production activities, lifting of  restrictions on our network use, the end of shelter in place orders and other home confinement,  international revenue growth, cash spending on content, free cash flow, and the impact on competitors  and suppliers; product innovation and releases; content availability and future content offerings; cash  use, including content spend; liquidity; free cash flow; future capital raises; consolidated revenue,  revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, earnings per share, global streaming  paid members and membership growth, and global streaming paid net additions. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home  filmed entertainment; and the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. A detailed discussion of  these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially  from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) on January 29, 2020. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors  should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: We have grown to over 69 million members around the world and expect to end this year with over 74 million members. With a successful launch in Japan, and our launches next week in Spain, Italy and Portugal, we remain on track to become global by the end of 2016. Our summary results and forecast for Q4 are below. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Global membership grew 3.62 million to 69.17 million members compared to prior year growth of 3.02 million, and a forecast of 3.55 million. Operating income was $74 million, compared to prior year of $110 million and a forecast of $81 million. Seven quarters ago we moved to providing you our internal forecast for the quarter ahead. We strive for accuracy in this projection and, when it comes to global net additions, Q3 was our most accurate to date: we were within 2% (3.62 vs. 3.55) and within 10% on operating income ($74m vs. $81m). While global growth was as we expected, our forecast was high for the US and low for international. We added 0.88 million new US members in the quarter compared to 0.98 million prior year and a forecast of 1.15 million. Our over-forecast in the US for Q3 was due to slightly higher-than-expected involuntary churn (inability to collect), which we believe was driven in part by the ongoing transition to chip-based credit and debit cards. In terms of US net additions, through the first nine months of 2015, we are slightly ahead of prior year, and we expect to finish 2015 at about 2014 levels. This would mark the 4th consecutive year we've added about 6 million members in the US. Our US contribution margin in Q3 expanded 375 basis points year over year to 32.4%. This was inclusive of an acceleration in the amortization of some of our licensed content, similar to how we already treat originals and reflecting more viewing in the first month. The effect of this change was a $13 million decrease in US streaming contribution profit in Q3. For Q4, we anticipate 1.65 million US net adds and US contribution margin of 34.0% vs. 28.0% in the year ago quarter. We continue to target a 40% US contribution margin by 2020. International net add growth totaled 2.74 million compared to 2.04 million in the prior year and a 2.40 million forecast. Excluding the impact of foreign currency ($96 million on a year over year basis), international ASP improved 6% vs. Q3 '14, helped by plan mix. In August, we raised our high-definition 2-screen monthly price plan in Europe by one Euro without negatively impacting growth. As we have indicated previously, international contribution losses will grow sequentially in Q4 as we launch Spain, Italy and Portugal. We have announced our expansion to South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore in early 2016. Our plan remains to run around break-even through 2016 and to deliver material profits thereafter. Last week we increased prices in several countries including the US, to improve our ability to acquire and offer high quality content, which is the number one member request. Our US pricing is now $7.99 for our standard-definition 1-screen-at-a-time plan (unchanged), $9.99 for our high-definition 2-screen plan (up $1), and $11.99 for ultra-high-definition 4-screen plan (unchanged). Members who were paying $8.99 for the high-definition plan are grandfathered at that price for one year. 2Content As our membership expands, we are quickly becoming a global distribution platform for creators worldwide. Narcos, our latest original series, is a hit and is another fine example of a Netflix original -   embraced by both critics and audiences and global in nature (bilingual, Brazilian director and star, US     and Latin American cast, shot in Colombia) with substantial viewing across all our territories. This past quarter, we also unveiled our first locally-produced original series, Club de Cuervos, which   played strongly not just in its home country of Mexico but with Spanish speakers around the world, including the US. We are currently in production on our second Mexican original series, Ingobernable,   starring Latin American TV superstar, Kate del Castillo, and the French produced Marseille. We have   also announced original series productions in Brazil and Italy.   We will launch our first original feature film Beasts of No Nation on Netflix on October 16. This gripping   war drama featuring Idris Elba and Abraham Attah has received universal critical acclaim and is an early   Oscar hopeful. Attah won the prestigious Marcello Mastroianni Award at the Venice Film Festival    recognizing him as the best newcomer. We're also excited to release the first of four films from Adam Sandler, The Ridiculous Six, in December. This release comes on the heels of Sandler's global success    with Pixels ($240M worldwide box office) and the currently hot Hotel Transylvania 2 (already grossing     over $200M worldwide box office and yet to be released in many of the larger foreign markets).  Just three years into our originals strategy, we have come a long way and our content is increasingly recognized for its quality and breadth. This year, we garnered a Netflix-record 34 Emmy nominations, across 11 of our original series and documentaries and won four. Netflix and HBO were the only networks to have 3 shows competing for best series honors this year. HBO had an amazing year at the Emmys, but we have only just begun. In addition, Common Sense Media recently named 6 of our original series among the 25 best shows on TV for families with kids from age 2-17.   It is clear that Internet TV is becoming increasingly mainstream and traditional media companies are adjusting to the shift from linear to on-demand viewing. It is a great time to be a creator of content because studios make content to sell content (not to withhold it) and there are new bidders for their product. Some studios will choose to license content to SVOD services like Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix. Others may not. We have a lot of content to select from. We recently announced that we have acquired global second window rights to four major series. These are How to Get Away with Murder, ABC's highest rated new series from the 2014\/2015 TV season, the   eagerly anticipated Colony from Legendary Television and Universal Cable Productions and, from CBS,   Zoo, the most-watched scripted summer series of 2015 and the critically acclaimed, Emmy nominated  and Golden Globe winning Jane the Virgin. These deals will ensure that audiences around the world will   have access to these exciting series on Netflix. 3Last month, we did not renew our deal to carry movies from EPIX, as the films were non-exclusive, US-only and offered in windows even further behind other premium Pay TV outlets. So far, we've seen no material reduction in US feature film viewing as we have so many other films for members to enjoy. We are investing in high profile, exclusive and globally available original films and creating the first-of-their-kind global Pay TV deals directly with producers. In some cases, we are making the films available globally after a 30 day theatrical and VOD window or in the case of the upcoming New Regency film The Big Short, with Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell, we will offer the film   globally in a more traditional Pay TV window several months after theatrical and transactional VOD, in all territories excluding France. Product In September, we expanded our in-app purchase relationship with Apple by extending our partnership from Apple TV to iPhone and iPad. Now, new members around the world can sign up for Netflix in-app on the iPhone and iPad, creating a more seamless user experience. We recently announced a partnership with Virgin America, where new and existing members are able to stream the full Netflix service to their personal devices (at no additional cost) at 35,000 feet in the sky on newly upgraded Virgin America aircraft. Partnerships like this advance our goal to bring Netflix streaming to members wherever they are and whenever they want. Competition The competitive landscape remains vibrant as Netflix competes with many forms of entertainment for consumers' leisure time. Other SVOD services continue to evolve: Hulu now offers a commercial free option at $11.99 per month, HBO GO is expanding into Latin America, and the press reported that Amazon Prime spent about $250 million on the new Jeremy Clarkson show. They remain active bidders for content, in addition to all the cable networks around the world. As we have written in our Long-Term View, linear networks that embrace on demand and Internet   delivery as we have, will become more valuable and will experience renewed growth (like HBO Now), while those that do not will lose relevancy. The secular shift to on-demand consumption is best described as consumers evolving vs. old habits rather than Netflix vs. traditional media. We're all racing to fulfill consumer desires. DVD Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve and please over 5 million members, providing us with $80 million in contribution profit in Q3 (down 11% Y\/Y). The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and TV shows, remains attractive to a core member base and means that the tail on this business should be quite long. 4Free Cash Flow and Capital Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$252 million, down from -$229 million in Q2, due to the working capital intensity of our investment in originals, which results in higher cash spent upfront relative to content amortization. Investing in originals remains the right strategy for Netflix. Exclusive first-window only on Netflix content differentiates our service, allows us to leverage our global platform, reduces our dependence on third parties, and adds positive brand halo. Moreover, as more of our content spend is devoted to producing and owning our originals, we are building long term library value. At the end of Q3, gross debt totaled $2.4 billion, which represents a debt to total cap ratio of about 5%, and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash & equivalents and short term investments. We are likely to raise additional capital next year to fund our continued content investments.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 540-3700      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures  This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves, and to free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However,  these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion, content launches, including  timing of feature film availability; business outlook for our DVD segment; raising capital; member growth  domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  6  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2015.  The Company  provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from  these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or  circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.  7                                                                                                                                                          8 Netflix, Inc.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: In Q3, our global streaming membership grew by nearly 2 million, and our 29 million streaming members enjoyed over 3 billion hours of TV shows and movies from Netflix. We have compelling exclusive content, an outstanding member experience, and a brand that stands for high quality streaming entertainment. These strengths, combined with the industry-wide forces of improving Internet devices and bandwidth, are fueling our rapid growth around the world. Our summary results for Q3 2012 follow: 1Domestic Streaming Q3 Results and Q4 Outlook In Q3 we grew to 25.1 million domestic streaming members, on a guidance range of 24.9 to 25.7 million. For Q4, our guidance is for our U.S. membership base to increase to between 26.4 and 27.1 million, up more than 20% year over year from where we started the year at 21.7 million members. In Q3 we grew our contribution margin to 16.4%. For Q4, we are targeting 17%, an improvement of 60 basis points quarter over quarter and 600 basis points year over year from 10.9% last Q4. Membership satisfaction is very high, as seen in two key metrics: we increased our per member viewing in Q3 by more than 30% (year over year) to record highs by improving our content and member experience; and our voluntary churn is generally the lowest it has ever been.1 In contrast, involuntary churn has been increasing as we grow more mainstream and attract more lower-income households. Gross acquisitions continue to grow on a year over year basis. We also continue to see strength in repeat customers. While we are not growing membership as fast as in 2010, we think that over time nearly all U.S. households will be broadband households, nearly all video will be Internet video, and that as our content and member experience continue to improve faster than competitors, our long-term domestic market opportunity remains 2-3x that of linear HBO. Domestic Streaming Content Our members continue to enjoy TV shows from Netflix in huge numbers. About two thirds of our viewing is now episodic content, and about one third is movies. Both are important to us and our members. For on-demand movies, consumers today have many options at home, including $1.20 per night DVD from Redbox, DVR-recorded movies from premium and basic networks, DVD purchase and transactional on-demand offerings, like VOD or EST. In comparison, Netflix has better content discovery, is simpler to use, and is on all Internet screens. So our movie offering is substantially, but not amazingly, better than other movie options for consumers. 1 There are two components of churn\/retention: voluntary which is members cancelling their service, and involuntary which is Netflix cancelling their service due to our inability to collect from their debit\/credit card. For any set of members, churn declines over time as one would expect. Therefore, to detect trends, we look at churn\/retention at various points in time across our members' lifetimes, such as month 6 to month 7, for example. 2For serialized TV shows, however, we do offer an amazingly better experience, because our members can start right from the pilot episode of season one and watch multiple seasons at their own pace. Neither Redbox DVD nor the DVR truly offers this capability. Buying expensive boxed-set DVDs or even more expensive seasons of $2 episodes on VOD are the only other options for enjoying this discover a show behavior. Our high relative advantage in TV shows is part of why our viewing is now about two thirds TV shows. Of our top ten TV shows, six are only on Netflix, and not available on Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video, or HBO GO. The ratio is slightly higher for our top 50 TV shows. We have a very unique and compelling offering. While we were interested in keeping Epix movies exclusive to Netflix, we and Epix could not reach terms that made sense to both of us. We could better spend the incremental dollars on high profile TV titles. The movies from Epix constitute only about 5% of our viewing, and we continue to have them, on a non- exclusive basis. We will be a bidder for future fully exclusive studio output deals for movies as they become available. In general, to maintain a great service and low prices, we have to be choosy about what we are licensing for Netflix. Given the high volume of programming available on Netflix, titles come into and out of license nearly every day. Suppliers, of course, are incentivized to talk about how important their particular offering is to our service, and it can be concerning to investors to read stories of content non- renewal. We strive to offer our subscribers exceptional levels of high quality premium content choices. In order to do that, we have to make sure that relative to the cost of that content, we are making wise programming choices. Overall, Netflix now has a more engaging mix of movies and TV shows than it has ever had and continues to improve, as seen in our considerable growth in per member viewing. Our licensing teams are expert programmers informed by more than a decade of rich data on viewer preferences and viewing habits which allows them to license an overall mix of compelling content to uniquely please Netflix members. Our Netflix Originals are an integral part of our global content strategy, and we'll go into more detail about them below. International Streaming We added nearly 0.7 million international streaming members in Q3, ending the quarter with 4.3 million international members. Net additions were at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting stronger than forecasted subscriber growth in each of our international markets. 3Nordics We launched our service in the Nordics (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) just last week, and have been very pleased by the positive reception. Since this is our fourth regional launch, we were able to apply what we've learned from our previous market launches to optimize the content programming library and marketing. In our first week of service, we attracted more free trial members than we did in our first week of service in Canada, so we are hopeful of a Canada-like success in the Nordics. Nordics members are not in our Q3 results, since the launch was in October. U.K. and Ireland As announced in August, we are currently over 1 million members strong in the U.K. and Ireland and continued to see strong growth in Q3. The U.K.\/Ireland market is expensive for content due to the competition with Sky and Amazon LOVEFiLM. We are very happy to be ahead of LOVEFiLM, and intend to continue to expand our content and grow our members rapidly. As we expected, the U.K.\/Ireland market will take materially longer than Canada to get to profitability, given the high level of competition and the continued expansion of our content. Latin America We have over 1 million members in Latin America, and there are over 50 million broadband households across these growing economies. Our service is working very well and voluntary churn is low in most of the region. We are growing rapidly, and we continue to add more content, especially in Brazil. Per-member viewing is up substantially from launch one year ago. We are outpacing all of our competitors. The biggest issue holding back much stronger growth is payments. For a variety of reasons, many Latin American broadband households are leery of, or unable to, provide debit\/credit cards that can be accepted over the Internet. For those who do provide us debit\/credit cards, we see higher rates of payment declines than in our other markets. Since these are households who are successfully paying for 4    5    home broadband, we should be able to improve our effectiveness.  We are working hard on all avenues  to address these issues and accelerate our growth.  In the long term, as ecommerce further develops in  Latin America, these issues will lessen.     It will take longer than we had planned to get to profitability in Latin America, but we are confident that  this will be a very large and profitable market for us long term.       Canada    Canada continues to be a very strong market for us. Two years have passed since launch, and our  subscriber growth is steady to slightly accelerating.  Both retention and engagement are high among our  Canadian members.    We expanded our profitability in Canada in Q3 as revenue grew more quickly than content expense, and  we intend to steadily expand our contribution margin over time, even as we continue to add more  content.     Total International Results & Outlook    Total international contribution loss of $92 million was slightly higher than the $89 million loss in Q2, as  we decided to capitalize on our strong U.K.\/Ireland momentum by investing additionally in our content  library to drive more membership growth and more viewing.     In Q4, as we launched the Nordics, we expect international contribution losses to increase to  approximately $113 million (guidance midpoint) as we will have incremental content and marketing  expenses but minimal revenue yet from this market. We intend this to be our peak quarter of  international losses, and expect international losses will decline quarter by quarter next year.  Once  we've substantially reduced international losses, and with Netflix then being solidly profitable on a  global basis, we will launch our next round of international expansion.       Our aggressive investments today in international expansion have laid the foundation for building long- term profitable franchises in these markets, just as we have already done in Canada.  Consumers around  the world want Internet TV, and we are providing it for them in each of our markets.               6    Streaming Competition    With big markets comes competition. Since the transition from linear TV to Internet TV provides a  staggeringly large long-term opportunity, it is not surprising that we are seeing more competitors vying  for consumers' time and money.    One class of competitors are MVPDs and around the world they are getting better, offering on-demand  services through DVRs, and TV Everywhere extensions like Xfinity.com.  The prices charged by cable and  satellite services are generally $50 to $100 per month, and we are a supplemental entertainment choice  in comparison to these competitors.  When we compare our viewing growth in those U.S. markets  served by leading MVPDs offering TV Everywhere, versus the nation as a whole, we don't see any  difference. The implication is that even the best TV Everywhere isn't yet an attractive alternative to  Netflix viewing for Netflix members.    Another class of competitors is other low-cost, globally-ambitious Internet subscription services.  The big  four are Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and HBO.  We each have unique strategies to win share of consumers'  time and spending. Three of us are Internet firms with mostly licensed content, all getting into original  content.  One of us (HBO) is an original content firm getting into the Internet subscription business.  It is  possible that several of us of will be successful since some consumers will subscribe to multiple services,  each of which has unique content.       Hulu operates in Japan and the U.S. and is a joint venture owned by News Corp., Disney, and Comcast.    While there are now around 2 million Hulu Plus members in the U.S., the ownership of Hulu makes it a  wild-card in terms of future evolution as a global competitor.   We believe in terms of U.S. viewing, Hulu  is currently our closest U.S. competitor.   Hulu is investing in producing original content.  Hulu has  commercial interruptions in their paid and free service, unlike Netflix, Amazon and HBO.    Amazon is taking different strategies in the U.K. and the U.S.  In the U.K., Amazon bought the LOVEFiLM  DVD rental service early in 2011, presumably as a launch vehicle for streaming.   For most of 2011,  LOVEFiLM streaming was only available bundled with DVD rental and in late 2011, LOVEFiLM started  offering a standalone streaming service.  Netflix and Amazon LOVEFiLM now compete in the U.K. with  similar price points.  In the U.K., Amazon has Prime, but has not chosen to include streaming video as  part of Prime.  Our analysis of viewing and content says we are already modestly ahead in streaming  viewing and content library, which we are very happy about given the large head-start LOVEFiLM had in  the region.  Our content is substantially distinct from LOVEFiLM's content.  We will keep investing in  better content, and improving our member experience, which benefits from our global focus on  streaming.    In the U.S., Amazon is bundling streaming with its Prime shipping service, instead of with DVD rental.   The majority of our most popular content is unavailable on Amazon Prime Instant Video, per the  discussion above in the Domestic Streaming Content section.  Our members tell us they'd like more      7    content, not less, so we feel good about our relative content offering. Amazon is investing in original  exclusive content as well. Our estimate is that viewing of Amazon Prime Instant Video has yet to pass  that of Hulu.      HBO is planning to launch a direct-to-consumer Internet subscription service in the Nordics, matching  our low price point.  This will be the first test of our relative strengths in stand-alone subscription video- on-demand.  We think it will make strategic sense eventually for HBO to go direct-to-consumer in the  U.S., and become more of a competitor to Netflix; so, that is our operating assumption, and we are  looking forward to competing in the Nordics.    Since many consumers in that eventuality would subscribe to both HBO and Netflix, we would compete  like any two networks today.  Our content is distinct from their content.  Today we think the U.S.  viewing of HBO GO by HBO's approximately 29 million domestic subscribers has yet to equal overall  viewing of Hulu or Amazon Prime.     Finally, to be more complete in our assessment, we also compete for time with piracy, ad-supported  streaming services, pay-per-view\/VOD and linear programming.  In most markets there are now local  competitors, such as Sky's Now TV in the U.K. and Viasat's Viaplay in the Nordics.  And there will surely  be more who will try to build a compelling subscription streaming offering against Netflix, Hulu, Amazon  and HBO.    Against each of our competitors we have some mix of better exclusive content, better member  experience, and a clearer brand identity. We are working to expand these advantages to win even more  of those moments of truth when consumers decide on any given evening what service they turn to first  when looking for entertainment.  Despite this increasing competition, our per member viewing  continues to rise.     Original Programming    Our goal is to produce unique and compelling serialized content for a cost comparable to similar  licensed exclusive content, using these original series to strengthen our reputation and build deeper  emotional ties to consumers.  If we are as successful with originals as we think we will be in Q1, then the  attention paid to Netflix will be positive and substantial, and we'll have more people joining Netflix than  we would otherwise.     Our first streaming content type was movies.  Then we added licensed prior-season television.   This  third category of content is first window premiere of exclusive serialized episodic television.    We are now in full production of four original series to debut exclusively on Netflix in 2013, plus a  second season of Lilyhammer, which debuted on Netflix last February.           8    On February 1st, we'll release in all of our markets the entire first season (13 episodes) of David  Fincher's House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright.  The first few episodes are nearly  done and we are delighted with the results.  Typically when one discovers a new show on linear TV they  get the joy of watching a new episode only to have to wait a week or more to see the next one. We are  releasing all the episodes at once because that is the better member experience that comes from  Internet TV.    Later in the spring we will be bringing Netflix members the long-awaited fourth season of Arrested  Development, a show that has grown astonishingly in popularity in the six years it has been off-air and  which now has a large global base of fans awaiting season four.  Like our other originals, this will only be  available on Netflix within our markets.     After that comes Hemlock Grove, a horror thriller from scare king Eli Roth, starring Famke Janssen,  Dougray Scott and Lili Taylor, then Orange is the New Black, a prison dramedy from Weeds creator  Jenji Kohan starring Taylor Schilling and Jason Biggs, and lastly, season two of Lilyhammer.     If you step back a decade, our first competence as a company was DVD-by-mail.  Next, we figured out  how to succeed in streaming of TV shows and movies.  Then we started expanding internationally, one  market at a time, learning as we grew.   Like our global expansion, we will take our original programming  expansion step by step, getting better along the way.       Embarking on original series has implications from a cash flow standpoint.  Our cash expense for  originals is quite front loaded, compared to the P&L expense on these deals.  We'll often pay for the  entire 5-10 year license all in the first few years.  Q4 of this year will be the first quarter in which our  originals start to become a material use of cash relative to the P&L.  More on this topic below in the FCF  section.   Improving Streaming Member Experience    Our better member experience is key to staying ahead of the competition, and increasing consumer  engagement. When most companies grow, they see their engagement metrics drop, while we see the  opposite, with hours viewed per member continuing to climb despite our already large scale. Crucial to  driving hours viewed are the efforts of our product teams, who during the quarter launched several  improvements to the Netflix experience.    A key thing that sets Netflix apart is our algorithms for personalization, which help members find  content they will enjoy, and lead to increased viewing for any given set of content.  Compared to  simplistic most popular merchandising, our algorithms add much enjoyment to our members'  experience.  We continue to A\/B test new algorithms, and our rate of learning is faster than any  competitor because we have a larger membership from which to learn.          9    On the visual side, this quarter we launched a new and improved UI for smart phones (both iPhone and  Android), which allows for richer content browsing on devices. In addition, we launched our first multi- device experience: smartphones (both Android and iPhones) can now be used to control the Netflix TV  experience via the PS3.  As this interaction model becomes more common among our members, we'll  improve the experience to match the need, adding more functionality and expanding the device reach.     To increase consumer engagement, we launched an improved post-play experience on the website and  the PS3 (with other devices to follow soon), which makes it even easier to play subsequent episodes and  offer relevant suggestions at the end of movies.    As a sign of our achievements in the area of product development and the technical advancement of  television, we were delighted to receive this month our first Emmy from the Academy of Television Arts  and Sciences for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development.  DVD    DVD subscriptions declined this quarter to 8.6 million, at the better end of our guidance range. Over  two-thirds of these DVD members also subscribe to our streaming service.  We expect DVD subscriptions  to continue their decline but we're pleased the decline slowed in Q3.  DVD is a great reference format,  and we carry nearly every DVD ever published.  We continue to see minimal service-related impacts  from the first round of USPS processing center reductions that took effect in the first week of July.     The domestic DVD segment delivered $131 million of contribution profit in Q3, representing a 48%  contribution margin, higher than the 46% margin in Q1 and Q2 due to a lower rev share mix this quarter.   We anticipate contribution margin will be up slightly in Q4, and then down sequentially from Q4 to Q1  as usage increases in Q1 and the expected USPS rate increases take effect in January.      Global Profitability:  Q3 Results & Q4 Outlook     We remained profitable this quarter with $8 million of net income, and $0.13 EPS. Compared to Q2, net  income was essentially flat, as increased domestic streaming contribution profit (up $8 million) more  than offset a $3 million decline of DVD contribution profit, a $3 million increase in international losses,  and a $2 million increase in global operating expenses.       Our combined U.S. business remains strong. Excluding international contribution losses, we will  generate over $400 million of operating income this year after covering global operating expenses.  As  expected, in Q4, we will likely move to a consolidated loss because of our initial launch investment in  the Nordics.         10    Free Cash Flow & Content Commitments    In Q3, as expected, negative free cash flow of $20 million trailed net income of $8 million, and we ended  the quarter with $798 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Significant uses of  cash in the quarter (relative to net income) were cash payments for content (in excess of the P&L  expense), cash payments for PP&E (including cache boxes for our Open Connect program), and  reductions in miscellaneous accounts payable and accrued expenses.    As we've highlighted, our movement into original programming will require more up-front cash  payments than our typical content licensing agreements, beginning in Q4 and increasing in 2013. So, due  to initial cash payments for originals, in addition to other cash payments for content in excess of P&L  expense, we anticipate negative FCF for several quarters.  We have enough cash on hand to fund our  planned originals in addition to our ongoing expenses, maintain an adequate reserve, and then return to  positive FCF.  We believe the investment in originals is wise, and we will evaluate the performance of  the slate next year to determine at what level we should fund additional originals.      We have invested heavily over the past two years in building our global content library, and as a result,  the corresponding contractual obligations have ramped significantly. While we are still adding new  shows and movies to the service every quarter, and our engagement is growing, our content obligations  have stabilized. In particular, our total streaming commitments at the end of Q3 were flat sequentially at  $5.0 billion, with $2.1 billion due within the next 12 months. Of note, our content licenses and  corresponding obligations are our major cost of revenues. And, as we point out each time we reference  obligations, the $5.0 billion represents the known minimum obligation amounts, but does not include  obligations that we cannot quantify but could be significant.           11       Business Outlook        Summary    We believe Internet TV will grow for the next few decades, and that some firms will build extremely  valuable businesses providing consumers an incredible, personalized Internet TV experience.     Society has had over 50 years of linear TV dominance where channel owners decide what and when  people can enjoy content.  With Internet TV, consumers get power, control and convenience. They can  decide what, when, and where they want to watch. They can pause and resume anytime.  They can  enjoy content on a broad range of amazing devices.     Internet TV is the future of television, and we are leading the change.

Reed, Greg, and Ted have been working closely together for 15 years, and this makes formal externally how we have been operating internally. More details are here on our blog. Ted said: I want to thank Reed for his visionary leadership, mentorship and friendship over the last 20 years. We've all learned so much from his intellectual rigor, honesty and willingness to take big bets – and we look forward to working with him for many more years to come. Since Reed started to delegate management to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values and like-minded approach to growth. I am so excited to start this new chapter with Greg as co-CEO. Greg said: \"I feel humbled and privileged to become co-CEO of Netflix. Ted and I have worked together for many years – building tremendous trust and respect for each other. We're also motivated by the same goal: a desire to better serve our members so that we can continue to grow our business. In addition to these changes, Bela Bajaria, formerly Head of Global TV, has become Chief Content Officer and Scott Stuber has become Chairman of Netflix Film. Ted said: Bela and Scott are outstanding creative executives with proven track records at Netflix. In 2022 we premiered many of our most popular series and films in Netflix history, including Wednesday, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Purple Hearts, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, The Adam Project and Harry & Meghan – a testament to their leadership and creativity. I couldn't be more excited to work alongside them as we seek to delight audiences for years to come. For full details of Netflix leadership see here.

Revenue was slightly above our beginning-of-quarter projection, as paid net adds of 7.7M (vs. 8.3M in Q4'21) came in higher than our 4.5M forecast, due to both strong acquisition and retention, driven primarily by the success of our Q4 content slate. In addition, the US dollar depreciated vs. most other currencies during the quarter, which resulted in slightly higher than projected ARM. Operating income of $550M in Q4 was down vs. $632M in Q4 '21. This was above our guidance forecast of $330M primarily due to higher than expected revenue as well as slower-than-forecasted hiring. Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 7% compared to 8% in Q4'21. This year over year decline was due to the appreciation of the US dollar. For the full year 2022, our operating margin amounted to 18% vs. 3 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 2 Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchange rate movements. Assumes foreign exchange rates remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. 2 21% in FY21. Based on F\/X rates at the beginning of 2022 and excluding the $150M in restructuring charges in Q2'22, this translates into an operating margin of 20%, at the high end of the 19%-20% target we set in January of 2022. F\/X Neutral Operating Margin (Excluding Restructuring Charges in Q2 2022) * Based on F\/X rates at the beginning of each year (and excluding the $150M of restructuring costs in Q2 2022). Note: Excludes F\/X impact on content amortization, as titles are amortized at a historical blended rate based on timing of spend. EPS in Q4'22 was $0.12 vs. $1.33 in Q4'21. This was below our $0.36 forecast due to a $462M non-cash unrealized loss from the F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt as a result of the depreciation of the US dollar vs. the Euro during Q4'22. As a reminder, our approximately $5B of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge on the relative value of the Euro for net income. However, it doesn't affect operating income as unrealized gains or losses are recognized below operating income in interest and other income. For the full year, we recognized a non-cash unrealized gain of $353M from the F\/X remeasurement on our Euro bonds. Forecast As we noted in our Q3'22 shareholder letter, revenue is our primary top line metric, particularly as we develop additional revenue streams where membership is just one component of our growth (like advertising and paid sharing). The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the rollout of major new initiatives (paid sharing and ads) plus current uncertain macroeconomic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. We forecast Q1'23 revenue growth of 4% (8% on a F\/X neutral basis). We expect our F\/X neutral revenue growth to be driven by a combination of year over year growth in average paid memberships and ARM. This translates into modest positive paid net adds in Q1 '23 (vs. paid net adds of -0.2M in Q1'22). Our 3 expectation of fewer paid net adds in Q1'23 vs. Q4'22 is consistent with normal seasonality and factors in our strong member growth in Q4'22, which likely pulled forward some growth from Q1'23. In addition, we expect to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1'23 (more details below in the Product and Pricing section). We anticipate that this will result in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2'23 than in Q1'23. From our experience in Latin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing, which impacts near term member growth. But as borrower households begin to activate their own standalone accounts and extra member accounts are added, we expect to see improved overall revenue, which is our goal with all plan and pricing changes. Our long term financial objectives remain unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expand operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. For the full year 2023, as we continue to improve our service, grow our advertising business and launch paid sharing, we expect constant currency revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. We also expect year over year operating profit growth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F\/X). We have been targeting a FY23 operating margin of 19%-20% based on F\/X rates at the beginning of 2022. We now expect to deliver roughly 21%-22% operating margin on this basis (above the 19%-20% range). Rolling forward to F\/X rates as of January 1, 2023, this translates into a FY23 operating margin target of 18%-20%. For Q1'23, we expect operating margin to be down year over year (20% vs. 25%) due primarily to the timing of content spend. Content and Marketing People have more choice of films and TV shows than ever so we need to ensure that there's always something great for them to watch on Netflix, regardless of their taste, mood, or who they're watching with. It's why we're so focused on continuing to improve our content and broaden our slate. 2022's successful slate was the result of having the best creative executives working with best in class creators. Last year alone we launched : 4  Five of our Top 10 most popular English language TV seasons ever – Stranger Things 4 and Wednesday (both of which hit 1B hours viewed), Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, Bridgerton S2 and Inventing Anna – as well as Harry & Meghan, our second most successful doc series ever;  Four of our Top 10 most popular English language films ever –The Adam Project, The Gray Man, Purple Hearts and Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery – as well as The Sea Beast and The Tinder Swindler, our most successful animated and documentary films respectively;  Seven of our Top 10 most popular non-English films ever – Troll (Norway), All Quiet on the Western Front (Germany), Black Crab (Sweden), Through My Window (Spain), The Takedown (France), My Name is Vendetta (Italy), and Loving Adults (Denmark);  Two of our Top 10 most popular non-English TV shows ever – All of Us Are Dead and Extraordinary Attorney Woo, both from Korea. 4 For View Hours for these titles, please visit Netflix Top 10. 4 We're also pleased with the progress we've made with returning titles. Members watched more Netflix returning seasons and sequels in 2022 than ever before across a broad range of genres – from film (Enola Holmes 2, Lost Bullet 2 and two 365 Days sequels) and unscripted (Selling Sunset S5 and Love is Blind S3) to award winning drama (Ozark S4 and The Crown S5), local language series (Sintonia S3, Young Royals S2 and Alice in Borderland S2, whose success pushed S1 back into the Top 10 after its launch) and animation (Big Mouth S6). It's hard to think of two titles that more successfully pierced the zeitgeist this year than Stranger Things 4 and Wednesday. Both pushed old songs into the music charts: Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill went to number 1 on Billboard's Global charts for the first time, 37 years after it was first released, and Lady Gaga's Bloody Mary made it onto the Billboard top 40 list for the first time ever, 11 years after it was first released. We get amazing results when we have a Wednesday, Glass Onion or Monster moment with our members. We believe people typically sign up for a streaming service because they've heard about a title you simply must watch from a friend, seen the excitement on social media or read about it in the press. Generating conversation is our primary marketing goal because we see that it drives acquisition and encourages existing members to watch more, which in turn helps with retention. For Ryan Murphy's The Watcher, conversation about the series led to fans flocking to the house, a Saturday Night Live spoof and a spike in home security sales. Our Wednesday campaign, with all our marketing in Wednesday's iconic voice, generated 1.5B organic social impressions pre-launch, a record for a Netflix season one. Over time, we hope to have more and more of these moments across film and TV, and to replicate these successes on the games side. It's now slightly over a year since we launched games on the Netflix service. We've made good progress in that time - creating the infrastructure to deliver games to mobile devices, building a portfolio of 50 games across many genres and acquiring four game studios to bolster our internal production capabilities. In Q4, we launched season four of unscripted series Too Hot to Handle, which was a top 10 title for us globally for three consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, we debuted our Too Hot to Handle game, which has been our biggest game launch to date and is another encouraging sign in the long term opportunity to entertain members with Netflix intellectual property (IP) across different mediums. In 2023, we'll continue to expand our offering with more games, with a focus on Netflix-related IP. Product and Pricing As discussed over the past few quarters, we're working to give people more choice when it comes to price as well as greater control over their Netflix account. In November, we successfully launched our new, lower priced ad-supported plan in 12 countries. We believe branded television advertising is a substantial long term incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Netflix, and our ability to stand up this business in six months underscores our commitment both to give members more choice and to reaccelerate our growth. While it's still early days for ads and we have lots to do (in particular better targeting and measurement), we are pleased with our progress to date across every dimension: member experience, value to advertisers, and incremental contribution to our business. Engagement, which is consistent with members on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected and we believe the lower 5 price point is driving incremental membership growth. Also, as expected, we've seen very little switching from other plans. Overall the reaction to this launch from both consumers and advertisers has confirmed our belief that our ad-supported plan has strong unit economics (at minimum, in-line with or better than the comparable ad-free plan) and will generate incremental revenue and profit, though the impact on 2023 will be modest given that this will build slowly over time. Later in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today's widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business. While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change for members who share their account more broadly. So we've worked hard to build additional new features that improve the Netflix experience, including the ability for members to review which devices are using their account and to transfer a profile to a new account. As we roll out paid sharing, members in many countries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don't live with. As is the case today, all members will be able to watch while traveling, whether on a TV or mobile device. As we work through this transition – and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don't convert to extra members or full paying accounts – near term engagement, as measured by third parties like Nielsen's The Gauge, could be negatively impacted. However, we believe the pattern will be similar to what we've seen in Latin America, with engagement growing over time as we continue to deliver a great slate of programming and borrowers sign-up for their own accounts. Competition We continue to operate in a highly competitive market as consumers have a vast number of entertainment choices. Beyond our direct streaming competitors, we also vie for consumers' time against linear TV, YouTube, short form entertainment like TikTok, and gaming, to name just a few. The silver lining is that the market for entertainment is huge and Netflix is still very small by comparison. For example, in the more than 190 countries we operate in, our $30B+ of annual revenue compares against the combined annual estimated ~$300B pay TV\/streaming industry, $180B branded TV advertising spend and $130 billion consumer spend on gaming . 5 It's not easy to build a large and profitable streaming business. But we're competing from a position of strength, as we lead the industry in terms of engagement, revenue and streaming profit. As a pure-play streaming company, we're also not anchored to shrinking legacy business models, like traditional entertainment firms, allowing us to lean hard into the big growth opportunity ahead of us. As we've said before, beyond revenue and profitability, another way to look at our business is through engagement, and we are pleased to have Kantar join Nielsen – who have expanded their efforts – and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming as well as the viewing share of different entertainment companies in Brazil, Mexico, and Poland. 5 Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludes hardware sales. 6 As can be seen in the newly reported markets of Mexico, Brazil, and Poland, we are less than 5% of TV viewing. And in our largest markets like the US and the UK, we are still less than 10% of TV screen time. As one of the leaders in streaming across all markets, we're encouraged by the fact that streaming overall accounts for less than 40% of viewing across these markets (and as little as 6% in Poland). We believe ultimately the vast majority of time spent on TV will happen via streaming, which should provide a long runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. tablet and laptop), all others are TV only. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities was $0.4B in Q4'22 (vs. -$0.4B in the prior year period) and $2.0B for FY22 (vs. $0.4B in FY21). Free cash flow (FCF) for Q4 totaled $0.3B, compared with -$0.6B in 6 the year ago quarter. For FY22, we generated FCF of $1.6B (vs. -$0.2B in FY21), above our forecast of approximately $1B. Now that we are a decade into our original programming initiative and have successfully scaled it, we are past the most cash intensive phase of this buildout. As a result, we believe we will now be generating sustained, positive annual free cash flow going forward. Assuming no material swings in F\/X, we expect at least $3B of FCF for the full year 2023. We closed two previously announced acquisitions in Q4 - leading animation studio Animal Logic and games studio Spry Fox. We funded these purchases from cash on hand. 6 Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. 7 Gross debt at quarter end totaled $14B, in-line with our targeted range of $10-$15B. With cash and short term investments of $6B, net debt totaled $8B, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA. We don't have any scheduled debt 7 maturities in FY23 and only $400M of debt maturities in FY24. All of our debt is fixed rate. Our capital structure policy is unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (e.g., about $5.2B based on Q4 revenue). After meeting those needs, we intend to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Assuming no material acquisitions, we anticipate resuming our share buyback program in 2023. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Two years ago we increased our focus on sustainability and related initiatives – building a team of 8 experts, announcing an ambitious environmental commitment, and exploring creative-friendly ways to reduce emissions in our productions (which account for more than half of our emissions as a company). As a result, Netflix production sets are becoming more sustainable through cleaner technologies, including electric vehicles and clean alternatives to diesel generators. In 2021, we created the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, committing $100M over five years to further develop our pipeline for underrepresented talent.  Through the fund, Netflix supports external organizations committed to creating equitable opportunities in the TV and film industries, as well as bespoke Netflix programs that help us to identify, train and provide job placement for emerging talent globally. To date we've committed $29M towards these initiatives, supporting over 1,000 up-and-coming creatives and more than 35 programs around the world.

Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F\/X neutral revenue and operating margin allows investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currency fluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. We are not able to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the exact amount or timing of the reconciling items, including property and equipment and change in other assets, and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our expected results for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023; adoption and growth of internet entertainment; growth outlook and market opportunity; competitive position; core strategy and business model; content offerings; our games strategy; monetization through pricing and tiering structures,  including paid sharing; ad-supported tier and its prospects; our competitors' performance; account sharing; impact of foreign exchange rates; seasonality; cash spend; stock repurchases; paid net additions, membership growth and retention; engagement; consolidated revenue, revenue and ARM growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively, including for consumer engagement with different modes of entertainment; our ability to monetize account sharing; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; macroeconomic conditions and timing of content releases. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange 11 -->","completion":" Slightly Positive\n"}
{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: In Q1, we added over 3 million streaming members, bringing us to more than 36 million, who collectively enjoyed on Netflix over 4 billion hours of films and TV shows. Our summary results for Q1 2013 follow: 1Domestic Streaming Our U.S. streaming business achieved strong growth in Q1. We added over 2 million members to the service, launched to great reception our first Original series of 2013 House of Cards, and improved our streaming contribution margin above our 100 bps target. We added 2.03 million members compared to 2.05 million in the prior quarter and 1.74 million in Q1 a year ago. In terms of comparing our Q1 net additions to last year's performance, it's worth reminding everyone of the change we made to our member definition as detailed in the January 2012 Investor letter in which we immediately excluded from our member count those members who are on payment hold. This more conservative definition translated into ~300,000 fewer net additions in Q1 2012, so we would have reported about 2 million. Therefore, think of Q1 2013 net adds as roughly comparable to the year ago period, a positive outcome. For many years, as a DVD-based business, Q1 net additions have been larger than the prior quarter net adds, but not this Q1. For DVD, factors such as a robust holiday DVD release slate and publicity for new movies created by the awards season telecasts likely influenced this pattern, boosting Q1 relative to Q4. This Q4 to Q1 pattern appears to be different for our streaming business, and this is our first clean streaming holiday season to show the seasonality. We've seen improvements in our business over the last year in content, in our product, in optimizing the way we process payments, and in the general recovery of our brand. All of these improvements contribute to higher member satisfaction, which we see in higher year-over-year levels for members' likelihood to recommend our service. During the quarter, we continued to grow members and revenue faster than content spending and our domestic streaming contribution margin increased to 20.6% in Q1, a further 140 bps of improvement from Q4 (not including 70 bps resulting from reclassifying marketing overhead)1. On a year-over-year basis, we expanded contribution margin over 600 bps on essentially flat marketing expense. Our target remains to expand contribution margin on average about 100 bps per quarter. We introduced our streaming only plan at $7.99 in 2010. We've been adding more content to the service ever since, and are very happy with membership growth at this low price point. In terms of significant U.S. licensing deals, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros. TV group for selected complete previous seasons of popular shows from Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation and Adult Swim, as well as the TNT serialized drama Dallas. We also reached agreement directly with Warner Bros. TV to bring to Netflix members earlier, and more 1 As previewed in our January 2013 Investor letter, starting this quarter, marketing overhead is now part of global G&A (consistent with how we treat content overhead) and is not allocated to the domestic streaming segment. 2exclusively than ever before, complete previous seasons of some of the hottest shows on network and cable TV -- including Revolution (NBC), The Following (Fox), Longmire (A&E), and Political Animals (USA). The deal with Warner Bros. Television is significant because it illustrates our evolution to a curator of select programming. Many of our earliest deals were with networks and cable channels and included some shows that have not proven successful. Those networks and channels are also uniquely leveraged by their cable and satellite partners to hold back for as long as possible the availability of shows while limiting the kind of on-demand exclusivity we favor. By dealing directly with the producers of TV shows, we are better positioned to pick just those shows that we believe will work best and secure rights that may be otherwise blocked by TV carriage and transmission deals. In that same spirit, we're also thrilled with our unique arrangement with Fox Television Studios to bring a third season of the fan favorite The Killing exclusively to our U.S., Canadian and Latin American members 90 days after the season finale airs on AMC. In the U.K., Ireland and Nordic countries, new episodes will premiere weekly and exclusively on Netflix, just days after the U.S. broadcast. As we continue to focus on exclusive and curated content, our willingness to pay for non-exclusive, bulk content deals declines. At the end of May we'll be allowing our broad Viacom Networks deal for Nickelodeon, BET, and MTV content to expire. We are in discussions with them about licensing particular shows but have yet to conclude a deal. We continue to do lots of other business with Viacom around the world, such as our exclusive Pay1 deal for Paramount titles in Canada. With all the recently added fresh programming from Disney, Cartoon Network, Hasbro's The Hub and Dreamworks Animation, we have a great kids offering. As we discussed a quarter ago and in our April 2012 Investor letter appendix, we generally expect Q2 net additions to be lower than prior year Q2 due to increased seasonality of net additions. This coming Q2, however, we have Arrested Development, and momentum from lots of new content coming to the service, so we expect to see slightly higher net additions than Q2 a year ago. Last quarter we shared with you that of our top 200 titles, Amazon Prime Instant Video had only 73. This quarter it was 74. International Our international membership grew by 1 million during the quarter to a total of 7.1 million, generating 14% of global revenue. During Q4 2012, we added 1.8 million net international members and 1.2 million 3during Q1 20122. The Nordics and the UK\/Ireland launch in Q4'12 and Q1'12, respectively, resulted in an elevated level of net additions in those launch quarters as we benefited from the initial growth of a new territory. In all of our markets, we saw growth and improved profits or reduced losses. International contribution losses improved $28 million sequentially, better than expected due primarily to less growth in content spending than forecast. For Q2, we are not forecasting a substantial improvement in contribution losses because we are increasing our international content spending in line with revenue growth. In early Q2, we implemented a modest price increase (15 BRL to 17 BRL) in Brazil, approximately matching local inflation over the last two years. We plan to launch an additional European market during the second half of 2013. We'll have more to say about this on our July earnings call. Original Series On February 1, we premiered all 13 episodes of House of Cards to enormous popular and critical acclaim. The global viewing and high level of engagement with the show increased our confidence in our ability to pick shows Netflix members will embrace and to pick partners skilled at delivering a great series. The high level of viewer satisfaction implies we are able to target the right audience without the benefit of existing broadcast or cable viewing data and the strong viewing across all our markets gives us faith in our ability to create global content brands in a cost-effective, efficient way. Our decision to launch all episodes at once created enormous media and social buzz, reinforcing our brand attribute of giving consumers complete control over how and when they enjoy their entertainment. Some investors worried that the House of Cards fans would take advantage of our free trial, watch the show, and then cancel. However, there was very little free-trial gaming - less than 8,000 people did this - out of millions of free trials in the quarter. On April 19, we launched all 13 episodes of Hemlock Grove, a horror thriller from Eli Roth and we're very pleased with its early performance. Hemlock Grove was viewed by more members globally in its first weekend than was House of Cards and has been a particular hit among young adults. Up next is the long-awaited and much-anticipated fourth season of comedy cult favorite Arrested Development, with all 15 episodes available on May 26. 2 The effect from the change to our member definition as discussed in the domestic streaming segment was very small for international (23,000 fewer Q1 2012 international net additions) because we had already excluded members on payment holds in LATAM. 4This summer, we'll launch Orange Is the New Black, a prison dramedy from Weeds creator Jenji Kohan; Derek, a heartfelt, funny look at life in a senior center from Ricky Gervais; and, later in the year, season two of Lilyhammer. During the quarter, we announced two new Original series coming to Netflix. Turbo: F.A.S.T. (Fast Action Stunt Team), is a collaboration with DreamWorks Animation and our first ever series for kids. It will continue the story of the summer DreamWorks Animation movie Turbo when it premieres on our service in December. Coming to Netflix in late 2014, will be Sense8, a new Sci-Fi thriller from the Wachowski siblings, who created the Matrix Trilogy and Cloud Atlas, and J. Michael Straszynski, creator of the hit TV series Babylon 5. As we've said before, our first slate of Originals will represent a small percentage of both our content budget (i.e. P&L expense) and total viewing hours this year, though cash use is front loaded relative to the P&L expense. Long term, we believe the value of our Original series in driving acquisition and retention improvements will be borne out as we add more seasons of already popular shows like House of Cards and further series. Harry Potter was not a phenomenon in book one, compared to later books in the series. Marketing With the broader acceptance of streaming and Internet Television, more of our marketing now focuses on the content we bring to members. The launch of House of Cards provided a halo effect on our entire service and spoke to the quality of experience members can expect from Netflix. In addition to our emphasis on Original series, we are delivering targeted messages as high-profile titles arrive on the service. This marketing strategy is designed to attract new members, excite current members to watch more, and encourage past members to come back. Our media spend is increasingly digital, with a moderate reduction in our use of linear TV advertising. We have seen encouraging results from online video ads and we will continue to find new ways to reach consumers at key stages along their consumer journey from initial awareness to free trial. 5Improving Member Streaming Experience We continue to make the member experience better through AB testing, measuring the impact of our innovation on acquisition, retention, and hours of viewing. During the quarter, we continued to explore new payment vehicles with a focus on Latin America, adding direct debit with a number of banks in the region. Adding direct debit has lowered one of the barriers to membership in the region and is an example of how we generally expand the acquisition funnel, a focal point for our teams. We had a number of wins during the quarter with new algorithmic techniques to match members with content they'll enjoy, driving more Netflix watching. The launch of House of Cards allowed us to explore new ways to promote significant individual titles to those members who are most inclined to watch without over-promoting to members with different tastes and are pleased with the results. In many households, Netflix is used by different family members, and we tested a Profiles feature that separates the activity of each individual. This enables us to offer more relevant personalized suggestions for each individual, and we expect to roll out profiles globally in the coming months. In January, the Video Privacy Protection Act was updated, allowing us to launch social features in the U.S, that we've been testing in the rest of the world since late 2011. We expect to see more social discovery of content to watch, supplementing the existing taste-based techniques we have relied upon to date. We'll continue to test and innovate around social features. We also released the next major version of our Netflix player technology to our consumer electronics partners to include in their Smart TVs and set-top boxes. The new platform emphasizes size and performance improvements, and offers dramatically faster playback startup (aiming to match the time required for a linear channel change). This new platform will appear in a few new devices in time for the holiday season, and will roll out more widely in the spring 2014 refresh for many CE manufacturers. We continue to realize gains (in availability, scalability, and cost savings) from our push to migrate our technology to the cloud, and we recently launched the Netflix Cloud Prize as a way to accelerate evolution of the Netflix Open Source platform. In addition, we are developing and sharing standards, such as HTML5 video standards and encoding format standards, and we are actively working with our studio suppliers to create a more robust supply chain for delivery of content. A few members with large families run into our 2-simultaneous-stream limit. To best serve these members, we're shortly adding a 4-stream plan, at $11.99 in the U.S., and we expect fewer than 1% of members to take it. 6DVD DVD memberships declined modestly to about 8 million. Combined with lower than expected content costs, higher revenue drove a better-than-expected $113 million contribution profit in Q1, representing a 46.6% contribution margin. The expected sequential decline in DVD contribution margin was due to seasonally higher usage in Q1 and the USPS rate increase of $0.01 each way that took effect in January. Absent USPS rate increases, we've been able to maintain our DVD contribution margin as members and shipment volume decline. We anticipate continuing to be able to maintain the margins we see in the first half of 2013 throughout the full year. Consistent with our view last quarter, we don't foresee USPS service changes that will have a material negative impact upon us or our members for the remainder of 2013. Going forward we'll continue to provide our full DVD segment level reporting but will only provide guidance on DVD contribution profit since that is what we focus on. Global Profitability: Q1 Results & Q2 Outlook Consolidated Q1 net income was $3 million ($0.05 EPS) and includes a $16 million loss on extinguishment of debt, net of taxes, related to the refinancing of our 8.5% bond in February. Excluding this loss, our net income would have been $19 million ($0.31 EPS), above our guidance because of the outperformance across all three of our operating segments. Net income, excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt, was up sequentially as an $18 million increase in domestic streaming contribution profit and a $28 million decrease in international losses more than offset a $14 million decline of DVD contribution profit and an increase in global operating costs. In Q2, our guidance implies net income roughly flat with Q1 (absent the loss on extinguishment of debt). We had a tax benefit in Q1 related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit that will not repeat in Q2, so higher sequential operating profit will be partially offset by higher sequential taxes. Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow of negative $42 million was $45 million lower than our positive $3 million in net income in the quarter primarily due to payments for Originals and non-originals content in excess of the P&L expense, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of the debt (a financing activity) and non-cash stock compensation expense. The investments that will continue to weigh on our cash flow relative to net income are Originals and non-Originals content (ongoing) and our Open Connect conversion (primarily in 2013). 7Capital In February, we raised $500 million in 8 year 5.375% notes with investment-grade covenants and used approximately $225 million of the proceeds to retire our 2007 8.5% notes. The refinancing of the notes, while being favorable to capital costs in the long term, was the basis for the $25 million pretax, or $16 million net of tax, loss on extinguishment of debt in the quarter. With the fundraising, we finished the quarter with a little over $1 billion in cash and equivalents. Market conditions were attractive and we were pleased to add cash to increase our reserves and afford us the flexibility to invest in additional Originals. We will convert the 2011 TCV $200 million convertible notes tomorrow (April 23rd) into the corresponding 2.3 million shares. We report diluted EPS as if the debt was converted, so our guidance for Q2 EPS already accounts for these shares, and there is no change to our cash on hand from this conversion.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures,  during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make  investments and for certain other activities.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net  income and diluted earnings per share provide useful information as these measures exclude losses that  are not indicative of our core operating results.  However, these non-GAAP measures should be  considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted  earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.      Forward-Looking Statements    This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding our approach to licensing content; member acquisition  seasonality; expansion to additional international markets and international contribution profits (losses);  impact and value of our original content; marketing strategy; improvements in our member experience,  including the rollout of our profiles and social features; conversion of our $200M convertible notes;  business outlook for our DVD segment; free cash flow and usage of cash; member growth, including  total and paid; revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2013.
