{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: We had a strong but not stellar Q2, ending with 130 million memberships. Membership growth was 5.2m, the same as Q2 last year, but lower than our 6.2m forecast. Earnings, margins, and revenue were all in-line with forecast and way up from prior year. Internet video is growing globally and we are fortunate to be one of the leaders. In addition to succeeding commercially, we are starting to lead artistically in some categories, with our creators earning enough Emmy nominations this year to collectively break HBO's amazing 17-year run.   Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Streaming revenue in Q2 rose 43% year over year, driven by a 26% and 14% increase in average paid memberships and ASP, respectively. Operating margin of 11.8% expanded 720 bps year over year, resulting in 262% growth in operating income. EPS of $0.85 vs. $0.15 included an $85 million non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy, meaning in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance. This Q2, we over-forecasted global net additions which amounted to 5.2m vs. a forecast of 6.2m and flat compared to Q2 a year ago, as acquisition growth was slightly lower than we projected. Paid net adds totaled 5.5m in Q2, compared with 4.7m last year and forecast of 6.1m. US net adds of 0.7m (vs. guidance of 1.2m) were down vs. last year's Q2-record 1.1m, but consistent with previous Q2 performance (0.5m in Q2'12, 0.6m in Q2'13, 0.6m in Q2'14, 0.9m in Q2'15, and 0.2m in Q2'16). Through the first six months of the year, our US net adds are slightly ahead of last year. Internationally, 4.5m net additions grew 8% year over year on broad market growth. Currency had a +$65 million impact on international revenue year over year (+13% international ASP growth on a FX neutral basis), but this positive impact was smaller than we had forecast 90 days ago as the US dollar strengthened meaningfully against many currencies since our Q1'18 earnings report in April. As a  reminder, we do not hedge our revenue with derivatives. Faster growth in international markets relative to the US creates a net revenue exposure to non-USD currencies. With the growth of our content production in 80 countries and expanding, we'll move more of our operating costs to non-USD to provide a little more natural hedging but we anticipate we'll still 2continue to have much more expense in USD than revenue. We slowly adjust pricing over time to mitigate forex moves over the longer term, but when currency movements are rapid, they will affect our near term operating margin. We'll tend to outperform our near term operating margin targets on dollar weakness and underperform on dollar strength. For the full year 2018, current F\/X rates have pushed our expectations on operating margin to be near the lower end of our 10-11% target range. We continue to expect steady growth in operating margin in 2019 and beyond. For Q3, we forecast global net adds of 5.0m (compared with 5.3m in Q3'17), with 0.65m and 4.35m in the US and international segment, respectively. Paid net adds are forecast to be 5.2m, up from 5.0m in Q3'17. Content Our broad slate of programming in Q2 highlights the diversity of programming we are providing. We debuted sci-fi action series Lost in Space, which we've renewed for another season. In addition, we   released the second season of one of our biggest originals 13 Reasons Why, as well as Santa Clarita Diet,     A Series of Unfortunate Events, Marvel's Jessica Jones, La Casa de Papel (Money Heist), GLOW and          Marvel's Luke Cage. In original kids programming, Boss Baby: Back in Business became one of our     biggest kids series ever. We continue to ramp up our production of non-English originals. In Q2, we debuted season 2 of 3%, our   sci-fi original from Brazil and premiered The Rain, our Danish original thriller which became one of our    biggest non-English original productions yet, with viewing all over the world. This serves as another data point that our international originals can be important to specific countries and regions and also play well outside of their home markets. Late in the quarter, we launched Lust Stories, a new Indian original   film, which has been a major success as our largest watched original in percentage terms in any individual market in its first month. Sacred Games, our first Indian original series, launched on July 6 and   is off to a similarly strong start. We will follow Sacred Games up in India with Ghoul on August 24.     We were honored last week with the most Emmy nominations of any network. The 112 Netflix nominations include five best series and best limited series nominations and are spread across 40 different scripted and unscripted series, TV movies, limited series, documentaries, talk shows, comedy specials and series for kids. This is a testament to the fantastic creators we work with across all forms of television. We are making good progress with our original feature films. As traditional exhibition focuses increasingly on superheroes and sequels, our on demand service allows us to serve a wide variety of tastes. For example, in Q2, we had success with several romantic comedies such as Set It Up, starring     Lucy Liu, Zoey Deutch, Taye Diggs and Glen Powell and The Kissing Booth, which peaked at #4 on IMDB's   chart of most popular movies, behind only Deadpool 2, The Avengers: Infinity War and Solo: A Star Wars      Story. Kissing Booth and Set it Up have been watched and loved by tens of millions of Netflix members      and the young stars of these films have seen their social media followings grow from a few thousand into the millions in the weeks following release. Of course, we also produce big event movies as well and we recently announced that Michael Bay, one of the most commercially successful action directors, will make his next film, Six Underground (starring Ryan Reynolds) for Netflix. Bay joins Martin Scorsese,   3Alfonso Cuaron, Susanne Bier, Paul Greengrass, Chris Columbus and many other top directors who are making their next feature films for Netflix. Product and Partnerships We continue to invest in our mobile experience. Last week, we unveiled our Smart Downloads feature on Android for members that use our offline mode, which is particularly popular in emerging markets. Now, when members finish watching a downloaded episode, it will be automatically deleted and the next episode will be automatically downloaded. Smart Downloads works only when the device is connected to WiFi so cellular data plans won't be used and device storage won't be affected since the last watched episode will always be deleted first before the next episode is downloaded. Members also have the option to toggle this feature on and off. We are expanding our partner-based bundle offerings, announcing deals with Telefonica in Spain and Latin America as well as KDDI in Japan. While the majority of our acquisition happens by consumers signing up with us directly, bundles continue to be a high-performing additional acquisition channel. We expect to continue to add such deals with partners around the world. Competition YouTube and Netflix are two leading global (ex-China) internet entertainment services. HBO and Disney are evolving to focus on internet entertainment services. Amazon and Apple are investing in content as part of larger ecosystem subscriptions. Each of these firms has unique content and is striving to find the best creators from around the world to entertain its viewers. There has never been a better time to be a creator or consumer of content. We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties to have attractive offerings. We anticipate more competition from the combined AT&T\/Warner Media, from the combined Fox\/Disney or Fox\/Comcast as well as from international players like Germany's ProSieben and Salto in France. Our strategy is to simply keep improving, as we've been doing every year   in the past. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q2 totaled -$559 million vs. -$608 million in the year ago quarter. We continue to anticipate FCF of -$3 to -$4 billion for the full year 2018, which implies that our content cash spending will be weighted to the second half of 2018. During Q2, we completed our latest bond deal, raising $1.9 billion. At the end of Q2, our gross debt balance stood at $8.4 billion and we had a cash balance of $3.9 billion and a $500 million undrawn credit facility. Our debt-to-EV is currently about 5%. While interest rates have risen and the federal tax rate is now lower (reducing the tax shield on interest costs), we judge that our after-tax cost of debt continues to be lower than our cost of equity, so we anticipate that we'll continue to finance our capital needs in the high yield market. 4Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: April 2018, January 2018, October 2017,  July 2017, April 2017, January 2017, October 2016, July 2016.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding foreign exchange rate fluctuations and impact on  revenue; growth of content production; accuracy of guidance; paid net adds; operating cost currency;  operating margin; seasonality; profitability; content strategy, including future content launches; partner  based bundled offerings; impact of competition; mergers and acquisitions involving competitors; free  cash flow; future capital raises; our credit rating and its impact on interest rates for capital raises;  domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating  income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  5  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K\/A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February  5, 2018. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual  performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above  and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K\/A.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: We live in uncertain times with restrictions on what we can do socially and many people are turning to entertainment for relaxation, connection, comfort and stimulation. In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant pull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million paid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million). As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020 compared to the prior year. As we navigate these turbulent circumstances, we're focused on our members by continuing to improve the quality of our service and bringing new films and shows to people's screens. Our Q2 summary results and forecast for Q3 are in the table below. Ted Sarandos appointed co-CEO and elected to Board of Directors Ted joined Netflix over 20 years ago, and we are thrilled to appoint him to be co-CEO with Reed. Ted has been my partner for decades. This change makes formal what was already informal -- that Ted and I share the leadership of Netflix, says Hastings. Lead Independent director Jay Hoag says Having watched Reed and Ted work together for so long, the board and I are confident this is the right step to evolve Netflix's management structure so that we can continue to best serve our members and shareholders for years to come. 1Ted will also continue to serve as Chief Content Officer. In addition, Greg Peters has been appointed COO adding to his Chief Product Officer role. We want Greg to help us stay aligned and effective as we grow so quickly around the world, said Hastings. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast In Q2, revenue grew 25% year over year, while quarterly operating income exceeded $1 billion. Average streaming paid memberships in Q2 rose 25% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 0.4% year over year. Excluding a -$289m impact from foreign exchange (F\/X), streaming ARPU grew 5% year over year. Operating margin expanded 770 basis points year over year to 22.1%, above our guidance forecast due to higher than expected membership and revenue growth. In addition, content and marketing expenses were lower than we expected, as the pandemic delayed some planned spend. EPS of $1.59 vs. $0.60 a year ago included a $119m non-cash unrealized loss from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt and a $220m non-cash valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (due to recent legislation limiting the use of California R&D credits). Our Q2 effective tax rate of 30.5% includes about a 21% point negative impact due to the valuation allowance. We added a Q2-record 10.1m paid memberships vs. 2.7m in last year's Q2. The positive variance relative to our 7.5m forecast was due to better-than-forecast acquisition and retention. In the first half of this year, we've added 26m paid memberships, nearly on par with the 28m we achieved in all of 2019. However, as we expected (and can be seen in the graph below), growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions. Our paid net additions for the month of June also included the subscriptions we cancelled for the small percentage of members who had not used the   service recently. 2The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. We forecast 2.5m paid net adds for Q3'20 vs. 6.8m in the prior year quarter. As we indicated in our Q1'20 letter, we're expecting paid net adds will be down year over year in the second half as our strong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year. In addition, Q3'19 included the positive impact of new seasons of both Stranger Things and La Casa de    Papel (aka Money Heist). We continue to view the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not    that meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment which we believe provides us with many years of strong growth ahead. For the full year 2020, we're still targeting a 16% operating margin. We're currently on track to exceed 16% although F\/X (and the relative strength of the US dollar) remains a wildcard. As always, our intention is to grow our annual operating margin year over year - we're currently targeting 19% for 2021. Content As the world slowly re-opens, our main business priority is to restart our productions safely and in a manner consistent with local health and safety standards to ensure that our members can enjoy a diverse range of high quality new content. Given the significant differences between countries (e.g., incidence of new Covid-19 cases, availability of testing, government and industry regulations), there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and we're adapting to local circumstances. Today, we're slowly resuming productions in many parts of the world. We are furthest along in Asia Pacific (where we never fully shut down in Korea, for example) and are now shooting live action series like season 2 of our Japanese original The Naked Director. In EMEA, we are now back in production in   many countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Italy, and the UK. While we recently resumed production on two films in California and two stop-motion animation projects in Oregon and expect some more of our US productions to get going this quarter, current infection trends create more uncertainty for our productions in the US. Parts of the world like India and some of Latin America are also more challenging and we are hoping to restart later in the year in these regions. Since our content production lead time is long, our 2020 plans for launching original shows and films continue to be largely intact. For 2021, based on our current plan, we expect the paused productions will lead to a more second half weighted content slate in terms of our big titles, although we anticipate the total number of originals for the full year will still be higher than 2020. We'll also round out our content offering with film acquisitions like The Trial of the Chicago 7 from Aaron Sorkin and The    Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run (global excluding US and China). We also acquired nearly  completed seasons of unreleased original series like Cobra Kai (seasons 1, 2 and a brand new season 3)   and Emily in Paris starring Lily Collins.   The pandemic and pauses in production are impacting our competitors and suppliers similarly. With our large library of thousands of titles and strong recommendations, we believe our member satisfaction will remain high. 3In Q2, we notched successes in many of our key content verticals. In English scripted TV, Never Have I  Ever, a fun, young adult dramedy from Mindy Kaling, broke through with 40m households choosing to  watch this show in its first four weeks, and 40m households for our new comedy Space Force (starring   Steve Carell). On the heels of Love is Blind, Too Hot to Handle and Floor is Lava are the latest in our line       of buzzy unscripted shows (51m and a projected 37m households, respectively, in the first four weeks). In original films, 27 million households chose to watch Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods, which was celebrated as   a soul stirring film for the ages. Extraction (starring Chris Hemsworth) and The Wrong Missy, a comedy       starring David Spade and Lauren Lapkus, were also big hits with audiences (99m and 59m households, respectively, chose to watch in their first 28 days). In addition, The Willoughbys (38m households in the   first four weeks) is an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster our offering for kids and families. We also saw increased viewing for some older titles like 13th, American Son and Dear White People - all       part of our Black Lives Matter Collection - as our members sought out stories that speak to racial   injustice and the Black experience in America. Our local language originals - like Dark in Germany, Control Z in Mexico, Extracurricular in Korea, The        Woods in Poland, or Blood & Water in South Africa - continue to be highly impactful, driving large    viewing, buzz and sign-ups in their home countries. We continue to see these stories find audiences all over the world. The best example of this was La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist): Part 4, which we   launched on April 3; through its first 28 days, 65m households chose to watch this hit show. For Q3, we recently released The Old Guard (starring Charlize Theron), which continues our recent string   of adrenaline-filled action movies. Later in July, we're looking forward to launching season 2 of The  Umbrella Academy, followed by The Kissing Booth 2 (the sequel to our hit romantic comedy), Project     Power (an action movie starring Jamie Foxx) and Enola Holmes (featuring Millie Bobbie Brown as the    sister of Sherlock Holmes, played by Henry Cavill) later in the quarter. Product and Partnerships We continue to test different pricing approaches in some countries including lower priced, mobile-only plans and our bundled offerings with MVPDs and ISPs. While some of these carry lower ARPU, the goal is to accelerate membership growth on neutral-to-better short term revenue (with incremental acquisition and improved retention offsetting the lower price). We think this strategy will increase long term revenue as a larger membership base can generate more word-of-mouth around our content and help us better understand peoples' needs in that country - so that we can more quickly improve our catalog and product experience, which would then lead to higher member satisfaction and growth as well as improved long term retention. A very small percentage of our members have not watched anything for the last two years and although we make it easy for people to cancel their subscriptions with just a few clicks, they have not taken advantage of that ability. So we decided to stop billing them and will do so for members meeting the same criteria going forward. Like all of our former members, they can easily restart their membership in the future. While this change resulted in a slight hit to revenue, we believe that pro-consumer policies 4like this are the right thing to do and that the long term benefits will outweigh the short term costs. In a world where consumers have many subscriptions, auto-pause on billing after an extended period of non-use should be how leading services operate. Competition All of the major entertainment companies like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal are pushing their own streaming services and two of the most valuable companies in the world, Apple and Amazon, are growing their investment in premium content. In addition, TikTok's growth is astounding, showing the fluidity of internet entertainment. Instead of worrying about all these competitors, we continue to stick to our strategy of trying to improve our service and content every quarter faster than our peers. Our continued strong growth is a testament to this approach and the size of the entertainment market. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated in operating activities in Q2 was +$1 billion vs. -$544 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 was positive for a second consecutive quarter at +$899m vs. -$594 million. Free cash flow was higher than net income due primarily to the loss on FX remeasurement and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, both of which were non-cash items that reduced net income. Our FCF profile is continuing to improve, which is being driven in part by our growing operating margin and the digestion of our big move into the production of Netflix originals that requires more cash upfront vs. licensed content. In addition, the pause in production has also pushed out cash spending on content into the second half of 2020 and into 2021. Due to the pause in production from the pandemic combined with higher-than-forecast paid net adds year to date, we now expect free cash flow for the full year 2020 to be breakeven to positive, compared with our prior expectation for -$1 billion or better. As we indicated last quarter, in 2021 we project that full year free cash flow will dip back to being negative again, although we believe the FCF deficit will be materially better than our peak deficit level of -$3.3 billion in 2019. There has been no material change in our overall estimated timetable to reach consistent annual positive FCF within the next few years. We're often asked by investors what our FCF profile would be at steady state or when our cash content spending matches our content amortization. The pandemic and the resulting pause in productions provides one early snapshot of what that may look like. In Q2'20, our cash spending on content was $2.6 billion, equivalent to our content amortization of $2.6 billion, or a 1x cash content-to-content amortization ratio2. This resulted in a FCF margin of +15% in Q2. Of course, our plan is to continue to grow our content spend (as we don't believe we are anywhere near maturity), but the above analysis may prove illustrative. And by the time our cash content-to-content amortization ratio 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 2 For additional details on these concepts, please refer to our Content Accounting Overview slide deck on our investor relations site.   5reaches 1x on a sustained basis (which is still many years away), we hope to have many more members and much greater revenue, operating margin and FCF. In April, we raised $1 billion of debt at a blended rate of ~3.3% across both US dollar and Euro tranches. We ended Q2 with more than $7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. As part of our commitment to racial equity, we allocated about two percent of our cash holdings - initially up to $100 million - into financial institutions and organizations that directly support Black  communities in the US. We hope other US large-caps will also consider taking this small and relatively  easy step to bolster US racial economic equity. With our cash balance, $750 million credit facility (which remains undrawn) and improving FCF profile, we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for over 12 months. As a result, we don't expect to access the debt markets for the remainder of 2020 and we believe our need for external financing is diminishing.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.  Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding future content offerings and the timing of such offerings,  including the uncertainty introduced by the Coronavirus pandemic; restarting productions; watch  metrics for certain titles; product tests, including those around pricing, and the anticipated impact of  such tests; impact of competition; future capital raises and external financing needs; global streaming  paid members, paid net additions and membership growth; paid net additions, consolidated revenue,  revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and free cash  flow, including future free cash flow profile and margin. The forward-looking statements in this letter  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including,  without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to  compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in  consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks, including those related to the  Coronavirus pandemic; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 29, 2020, as updated  in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The Company provides  internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these  forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form  10-K, as updated by Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Fellow shareholders,    Our broad slate of original programming helped drive a solid quarter of growth with streaming revenue  increasing 36% year over year and global membership surpassing 130 million paid and 137 million total.  We're thrilled to be growing internet entertainment across the globe.        1  Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Streaming revenue grew 36% year over year in Q3, as average paid membership increased 25% and ASP  rose 8%. International revenue included a -$90 million year over year impact from currency.  Excluding  the impact of F\/X, international ASP rose 11% year over year and 2% sequentially.  Operating margin expanded 500 bps year over year to 12%. This exceeded our forecast of 10.5% due to  the timing of content and marketing spend, a portion of which moved into Q4. EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.29  last year included an $8 million non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Eurobond and  a $38 million tax benefit related to adjustments to the transition tax on the repatriation of foreign  earnings and the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets (both related to true-ups from the 2017  US tax reform).   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report and we  strive for accuracy in our forecast. This means in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low  relative to our guidance. This quarter, we under-forecasted memberships. Total net additions of 7.0m  (up 31% vs. 5.3m last year) was higher than our forecast of 5.0m, and represented a new Q3 record. The  variance relative to forecast was due to greater-than-expected acquisition globally, with strong growth  broadly across all our markets including Asia.   For Q4, we forecast paid net additions of 7.6m, and total net additions of 9.4m, up 15% and 13%  compared with 6.6m and 8.3m in Q4 last year. We're still targeting operating margin to be at the lower  end of the 10%-11% range for the full year 2018.  This means that in Q4 we expect operating margin will  dip to 5% from 7.5% in the year ago quarter.  As we have written in previous letters, this sequential  decline in operating margin in the second half of 2018 is due to the timing of content spend and a higher  mix of original films in Q4'18 (film amortization is more accelerated than series amortization due to  more front-loaded viewing). We would have preferred our operating margin to have been a little  steadier over the course of the year, and we will target a little less quarterly variance next year in our  progress to our full year target of 13% (assuming no major FX moves).   Next quarter, we expect to reclassify certain personnel costs from G&A to Content and Marketing, and  from Technology & Development to Other Cost of Revenues. This change would reflect the ongoing  evolution of our business to include self-production of content. A growing number of employees are  becoming involved in developing content as we migrate to self-produce more of our content vs. only  licensing original and non-original content.  We expect to make the same change with marketing and  other tech employee costs to maintain consistency in approach.  The change would result in a  comprehensive view of our total spending on content and marketing. This reclassification would have no  impact on total operating expenses, operating profit or operating margin. If enacted, we will provide  quarterly pro-formas so investors will see the change cleanly.  Evolving to Paid Membership Focus  The chart below illustrates our weekly paid net additions (on the right) and total net additions (on the  left, which includes paid + free) over the last several years. Paid net adds are more steady, as total net  additions can be skewed by free trials of varying quality.  This skew adds noise to our membership  2  forecasts in a way that isn't material to revenue or the business. In comparison, paid net adds are a  more reliable indicator of revenue growth.    Because growth in paid memberships is more steady, our forecast for paid net adds has been historically  more accurate than our total net adds forecast. For example in Q2'18, our paid net adds forecast was off  by 11% compared to a 17% variance for total net adds forecast. In addition, we are learning that no free  trial may result in greater revenue in some markets, so free trial count at the end of a quarter will likely  be a less insightful predictor of future growth than in the past.   As a result, starting with our earnings report in January 2019, we'll only guide to paid memberships; a  year after that, in 2020, we'll cease reporting on end-of-quarter free trial count. We will show the  weekly paid net adds graph, as above on the right, in each earnings letter going forward. We expect this  additional disclosure will be helpful to your understanding of our business, in particular, how steady our  paid membership growth is in the near term.   Content  We have three major categories of content: licensed non-first-window content such as Shameless,  licensed original first-window content such as Orange is the New Black (owned and developed by  Lionsgate), and now owned original first-window content from the Netflix studio, such as Stranger  Things. Within those categories there are lots of subdivisions and per-territory treatments, but those are  the big three buckets.   It was just two years ago when we began building the third category: a film and TV studio within Netflix.  Some of our notable owned-titles in addition to Stranger Things include: Big Mouth, The Ranch, Bright,  Godless, The Kissing Booth, 3%, Dark, Sacred Games and Nailed It. In addition to reducing our reliance on  outside studios, this initiative provides us with greater control over the content we create (e.g., long  term global rights), the ability to strengthen title-brand-love and franchise value (like consumer  products) and potentially lower costs (as we can avoid the markup 3rd party studios charge us). To do  this, we've had to develop new capabilities to manage the entire production process from creative  support, production planning, crew and vendor management to visual effects, to name a few.  3  Today, we employ hundreds of people in physical production, working on a wide variety of owned titles  spread across scripted and unscripted series, kids, international content, standup, docs and feature films  from all over the world. To support our efforts, we'll need more production capacity; we recently  announced the selection of Albuquerque, New Mexico as the site of a new US production hub, where we  anticipate bringing $1 billion dollars in production over the next 10 years and creating up to 1,000  production jobs per year. Our internal studio is already the single largest supplier of content to Netflix  (on a cash basis).  We strive to offer a wide breadth of programming because we want to maximize the size of our  membership base and people have very diverse tastes that we seek to satisfy. This also reduces our  dependence on any individual title. Even our largest titles, which are viewed by tens of millions of our  members, only account for a low single digit percentage of total streaming hours. Therefore, the vast  majority of our growth in any given quarter is not attributable to any one piece of content, as you can  see by the steadiness in our paid net additions.   This past quarter, in original series, we launched new seasons of Orange is the New Black, Ozark,  Marvel's Luke Cage and debuted Insatiable. Late in the quarter, we released Maniac, a limited series  starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill.  We have also been ramping up our animated adult comedy  offering. In Q3, we successfully premiered Disenchantment, from Matt Groening who created The  Simpsons and Futurama, and Paradise PD, from the makers of Brickleberry, to complement Big Mouth,  Bojack Horseman and F is for Family.  We also continue to expand our international originals, with projects spanning India, Mexico, Spain,  Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and throughout the Middle East to just name a few. In India, our  hit series Sacred Games was followed up by Ghoul in late August. La Casa de las Flores, our latest  Mexican original, has become a big hit.   As part of our Summer of Love and building on the success of Set It Up and The Kissing Booth, we  released original films Like Father (starring Kristen Bell and Kelsey Grammer in a daughter-father  dramedy), Sierra Burgess Is a Loser (starring Stranger Things' Barb, Shannon Purser) and To All the Boys  I've Loved Before, which is one of our most viewed original films ever with strong repeat viewing. More  than 80 million accounts have watched one or more of the Summer of Love films globally and we are  already in production for the next set of original rom-coms for our members.   This December, we'll be launching ROMA, from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón. We support  simultaneous release in cinema and on Netflix, and the film will debut on Netflix and on over 100  screens worldwide, just as we are doing currently with 22 July, from Oscar-nominated director Paul  Greengrass. We believe in our member-centric simultaneous release model for our original films and  welcome additional theatre chains that are open to carrying our films to provide the shared-viewing,  big-screen experience to their customers who enjoy that option.  We've come a long way in the five years since launching original content on Netflix. In addition to our  commercial success, we're ecstatic when the creators we work with are recognized for their inspiring  work. This year, Netflix originals led with 112 Emmy nominations spanning 40 of our shows, docs and  4  specials across nearly every category and we're humbled to have tied HBO with the most number of  Emmy wins with 23.   We're also thrilled that Netflix has been a launching pad for a new generation of global stars like Millie  Bobby Brown, Jacob Elordi, Noah Centineo and Gaten Matarazzo. When our service helps our talent  develop huge fan bases (from small followings to over 10 million Instagram followers), we can attract  the best talent in the world. This explosive growth in popularity is a good indicator that our shows and  stars are breaking out around the planet.     More EU content  The European Union is currently rewriting its audio visual rules, which will eventually require  subscription streaming services to devote a minimum of 30% of their catalog to European works. In  addition, some member states are looking to require services like ours to invest some portion of local  revenues into European works. We anticipate being able to meet these requirements by evolving our  content offering.  We are heavily investing around the world to share stories broadly and to strengthen local production  capacity and opportunity. We'd prefer to focus on making our service great for our members, which  would include producing local content, rather than on satisfying quotas, but we anticipate that a  regional content quota which approximates the region's share of our global membership will only  marginally reduce member satisfaction. Nonetheless, quotas, regardless of market size, can negatively  impact both the customer experience and creativity. We believe a more effective way for a country to  support strong local content is to directly incentivize local content creators, independent of distribution  channel.  5  Product and Partnerships  We continue to expand our partnerships with pay TV providers, ISPs and mobile operators across the  globe. In Q3, we rolled out the first mobile bundle in Japan with KDDI and expanded our partnership  with Verizon to pre-install the Netflix app on Android phones. In Q4, we plan to roll out our previously  announced partnership with Sky UK.   Competition  We compete for entertainment time with linear TV, YouTube, video gaming, web browsing, social  media, DVD and PPV, and more. In that competition for screen hours, we lose most of the time, but we  win enough to keep growing.   As internet entertainment grows, more companies see the large opportunity. Content companies such  as WarnerMedia and Disney\/Fox are moving to self-distribute their own content; tech firms like Apple,  Amazon and others are investing in premium content to enhance their distribution platforms. Amid  these massive competitors on both sides, plus traditional media firms, our job is to make Netflix stand  out so that when consumers have free time, they choose to spend it with our service.   Within linear TV, New Fox appears to have a great strategy, which is to focus on large  simultaneous-viewing sports and news. These content areas are not transformed by on-demand viewing  and personalization in the way that TV series and movies are, so they are more resistant to the rise of  the internet. Other linear networks are likely to follow this model over time.   Free Cash Flow  Free cash flow in Q3 was -$859 million vs. -$465 million in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, our  growing mix of self-produced content, which requires us to fund content during the production phase  prior to its release on Netflix, is the primary driver of our working capital needs that creates the gap  between our positive net income and our free cash flow deficit.   We anticipate that FCF will be closer to -$3 billion than to -$4 billion for the full year 2018. We expect  our quarterly FCF deficit will increase sequentially from Q3 to Q4 as our year to date FCF is -$1.7 billion.  We currently see next year's negative FCF as roughly flat with this year.   We recognize we are making huge cash investments in content, and we want to assure our investors  that we have the same high confidence in the underlying economics as our cash investments in the past.  These investments we see as very likely to help us to keep our revenue and operating profits growing for  a very long time ahead.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: Summary:  Revenue, operating income and membership slightly exceeded our forecast in Q3'22.  We had big hits across TV and film in Q3 – launching some of our most watched series and films of all time, including: ○ Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,Stranger ThingsS4,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, The Gray Man, andPurple Hearts  Our lower priced ad-supported plan launches in 12 countries in November – just six months after our initial announcement. Our existing plans remain ad free.  Netflix has higher engagement than any other streamer – with room for growth: ○ In the UK, Netflix accounts for 8.2% of video viewing, 2.3x Amazon and 2.7x Disney+1; ○ In the US, Netflix accounts for 7.6% of TV time, 2.6x Amazon and 1.4x Disney + Hulu + Hulu Live2.  Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix's $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit. After a challenging first half, we believe we're on a path to reaccelerate growth. The key is pleasing members. It's why we've always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us. 1Based on reporting fromBARB, as of September 2022 2Based onNielsen's Gauge, as of August 2022 Q3 Results Our 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 5% increase in average paid memberships and a 1% rise in ARM3. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F\/X), revenue and ARM grew 13% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. The sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to F\/X. We under-forecasted paid net additions, which totaled 2.4 million vs. our 1.0m forecast and compared to 4.4m in the year ago quarter.  In APAC, revenue grew 19% excluding F\/X as average paid memberships rose 23% year-over-year. ARM was -3% year-over-year, excluding F\/X, partially driven by lower ARM in India, somewhat offset by higher ARM in Australia and Korea. We added 1.4m paid memberships in the region (vs. 2.2m last Q3).  Excluding F\/X, EMEA revenue and ARM grew 13% and 7%, respectively. Paid net adds totaled 0.6m vs. 1.8m in the year ago quarter.  In LATAM, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, supported by ARM growth of 16% vs. the year ago quarter excluding F\/X. We added 0.3m paid memberships, in-line with membership growth in Q3'21.  In UCAN, our most penetrated market, ARM and revenue grew by 12% and 11%, respectively, excluding F\/X. Paid net adds totaled 0.1m (similar to the 0.1m in Q3'21). For Q3, operating income totaled $1.5 billion vs. $1.8 billion in Q3'21. Operating income was above our beginning-of-quarter forecast, partially due to higher revenue, as well as a shift in timing of some spend from Q3 to Q4. As a result, operating margin of 19% was above our 16% forecast. The four percentage point year-over-year decline in operating margin is almost entirely due to the appreciation in the US dollar vs. most other currencies during this period. EPS of $3.10 vs. $3.19 a year ago included a $348 million non-cash unrealized gain from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Q4 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. The appreciation of the US dollar remains a significant headwind for us (and US-based multinationals in general). For Q4'22, we're expecting revenue of $7.8 billion with the sequential decline entirely due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar vs. other currencies. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Our revenue growth forecast is driven by our expectation for 4.5m paid net adds (vs. 8.3m in Q4'21) and ARM growth of 6% year-over-year, excluding F\/X. Our paid net adds forecast assumes that we experience our usual seasonality as well as the impact of a strong content slate, counterbalanced by macroeconomic weakness which leads to less-than-normal visibility. While we're very optimistic about our new advertising business, we don't expect a material contribution in Q4'22 as we're launching our Basic with Ads plan intra-quarter and anticipate growing our membership in that plan gradually over time. Our aim 3ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 2is to give our prospective new members more choice - not switch members off their current plans. Members who don't want to change will remain on their current plan, without ads, at the current price. We forecast Q4'22 operating margin of 4% vs. 8% in the year ago period. The fourth quarter is typically our lowest operating margin quarter of the year as it's usually our largest quarter in terms of content and marketing spend. In addition, the aforementioned F\/X impact has a high flow through to operating income (~75%-80% of the revenue impact) as most of our costs are in US dollars. Excluding the year-over-year impact of F\/X, our Q4'22 operating margin forecast would be 10% vs. 8% in Q4'21. TheUS dollar has strengthenedagainst most othercurrencies at a historic rate this year. Based on our YTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negatively impact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. As a reminder, our 2022 and 2023 operating margin target of 19%-20% is based on F\/X rates in January 2022, as we discussed in ourQ4'21 letterand subsequentearnings calls. We're on track to meet this F\/X neutral operating margin objective for 2022 (excluding the $150m of restructuring costs in Q2) and for 2023. With the appreciation of the US dollar though, our reported operating margin would be lower than 19%-20% should the US dollar remain above January 2022 levels relative to other currencies. Over the medium term, we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. Our long term goal remains unchanged - to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating profit even faster (as we expand margins) and deliver growing positive free cash flow. Guidance Evolution As discussed in previous letters, we are increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top line metric. This will become particularly important heading into 2023 as we develop new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing, where membership is just one component of our revenue growth. So, 3starting with our Q4'22 letter in January of 2023, we'll continue to provide guidance for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and fully diluted shares outstanding for the following quarter, but not paid membership. Similar to our regional membership disclosure, we'll continue to report our global and regional membership each quarter as part of our earnings release. Content & Marketing We started our original programming strategy about a decade ago as we anticipated that some competitors would eventually stop licensing their content to Netflix. It's been a huge challenge to build a lifetime of entertainment in just ten years in multiple languages and across so many different genres - series, films, animation, stand-up and non-fiction. And while we've had our share of misses, we've managed to create a very broad slate with many great series and films, for whatever your mood or tastes, from amazing storytellers around the world. Given everything we've learned, we're confident we can deliver even more member value per content investment dollar over time. One of the best ways to understand the success of our content is by understanding our engagement. So we're excited that BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board), the leading audience measurement and video ratings organization in the UK, is now reporting the share of video viewing for streaming services and broadcast groups in the UK on a monthly basis. In September, Netflix accounted for 8.2% of viewing, and we have more than 2x the monthly engagement of our next closest streaming competitor. This reporting is similar to Nielsen's Gauge, which launched in May 2021 when Netflix accounted for 6% of viewing compared to 7.6% in August 2022. Our hope is that other measurement companies around the world will join Nielsen and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming and the viewing share of relevant entertainment companies. We think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles. This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love. As the Google Trends chart shows, the ability to watch all of Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story helped drive significant interest in the show. 4 It's hard to imagine, for example, how a Korean title like Squid Game would have become a mega hit globally without the momentum that came from people being able to binge it. We believe the ability for our members to immerse themselves in a story from start to finish increases their enjoyment but also their likelihood to tell their friends, which then means more people watch, join and stay with Netflix. Our Q3 content slate was especially strong. In English scripted TV, we kicked off the quarter with Stranger Things S4, which generated 1.35 billion hours viewed - our biggest season of an English 4 language series ever. This was followed in August by The Sandman (351 million hours viewed), which was loved by fans and critics alike. Near the end of the quarter, we launched season five of fan favorite Cobra Kai (270 million hours viewed) and limited series Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story* (824 million hours viewed) from Ryan Murphy, which is now our second largest English series. We continue to see great success with our non-English programming too, with Squid Game making awards history by becoming the first foreign language title to win an Emmy - with six awards, including for directing, production design and lead actor. Also from Korea, Extraordinary Attorney Woo, a unique series about an autistic lawyer, has reached #1 on our weekly non-English series list in 28 countries, notching up 402 million hours viewed and making it our sixth largest non-English TV show ever through 28 days. Narco-Saints has been another huge K-Content win this quarter, with 128 million hours viewed since launch. Sintonia has been a big hit for Netflix in Brazil, with season three generating 38 million hours viewed. And while it is still early days for German series The Empress*, it launched with a very strong start (136 million hours viewed). Our goal is to create authentic local stories for members in the home territory, which we also make available globally. Film is incredibly important to our members. We expanded into original film in 2016 because producing our own movies across all budgets and genres has advantages over the next best alternative: only licensing from other studios in the first pay TV window (the pay-one window). Those advantages include first window availability on Netflix (pay-one movies debut generally well after theatrical release), global rights (pay-one movies are licensed by country), the ability to carry the films on Netflix in perpetuity (typically only for 18-24 months for pay-one films) and copyright ownership, enabling us to create derivatives like sequels and to use the intellectual property (IP) in games and consumer products. We continue to complement our original films with 3rd party licensed films - they remain an important and valued part of our service, but they are just one component of our broader programming strategy. We're pleased with the progress of our original film initiative. The big budget action film The Gray Man (254 million hours viewed) reflects the scope of our ambition to create theatrical quality blockbusters that can reach huge audiences on Netflix: 118 million households (many of which are multi person) if you divide the total hours viewed by the film's run time of 2 hours and 9 minutes. But since we're not limited by the need to optimize for theatrical attendance, we can also produce a wider variety of films that consumers can enjoy. For example, the romantic drama Purple Hearts was a hit among our members with 229 million  hours viewed. We're at an even earlier stage with animated feature films but in early Q3 we released The Sea Beast (165 million hours viewed), which is our biggest original animated 4 Hours viewed data is based on viewing in the first 28 days of release for each episode. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through October 16, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed at Netflix Top 10, where you can also find our detailed methodology. 5 film to date. On the non-English language film side, Darlings (33 million hours viewed), starring Alia Bhatt, launched to rave reviews and huge fandom in India. Loving Adults (67 million hours viewed), a psychological thriller from Denmark, and Carter (65 million hours viewed), a Korean blockbuster, were our two biggest non-English films of the quarter and are now our seventh and ninth most popular non-English films ever. We also continue to invest heavily in marketing, with a particular focus on innovative ways to drive conversation around our titles, which in turn boosts engagement for Netflix. For example, our campaigns for Stranger Things S4 and The Gray Man drove more than 9.8 billion and 1.2 billion impressions, respectively, across paid marketing, social media platforms and events. And content for Tudum, our global fan event that ran for its second year in September, generated almost 1 billion views - up over 30% from last year. Beyond TV and movies, we're coming up on the one year anniversary of our gaming launch. As we've said, this will be a multi-year journey for us to learn how to please game players. Our first year was about establishing our gaming infrastructure and understanding how our members interact with games. We now have 35 games on service (all included in every Netflix subscription without in-game ads or in-app purchases) and we're seeing some encouraging signs of gameplay leading to higher retention. With 55 more games in development, including more games based on Netflix IP, we're focused in the next few years on creating hit games that will take our game initiative to the next level. More generally, we see a big opportunity around content that crosses between TV or film and games. For example, after the launch of the anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (49 million hours viewed) in Q3 use of CD Projekt's game surged on PCs. Product and Pricing As we've been discussing over the past few quarters, improving our pricing strategy is an important near-term focus. Last week, we announced that we'll be launching an ad-supported subscription plan on November 1 in Canada and Mexico; November 3 in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the US; and November 10 in Spain. Cumulatively, these 12 markets account for ~$140 billion of brand advertising spend across TV and streaming, or over 75% of the global market . 5 To start, we're keeping it simple by offering one low-priced ad plan – Basic with Ads – at a price that's 20%-40% below our current starting price. So in the US, for example, Netflix will now start at $6.99 per month (compared to $9.99 today). The Basic with Ads plan will have ~5 minutes of advertising per hour, frequency capping and strong privacy protections. The reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice, especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue and operating profit over time. That said, it's still very early days and, since we're keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue. Finally, we've landed on a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing and we'll begin rolling this out more broadly starting in early 2023. After listening to consumer feedback, we are going to offer the 5 Excluding China and Russia, where we don't operate. 6 ability for borrowers to transfer their Netflix profile into their own account, and for sharers to manage their devices more easily and to create sub-accounts (extra member), if they want to pay for family or friends. In countries with our lower-priced ad-supported plan, we expect the profile transfer option for borrowers to be especially popular. Competition As we've long said, we operate in a highly competitive industry, where people have many different entertainment choices – from linear TV to streaming, YouTube to TikTok and gaming to social media. The silver lining is that the opportunity is very large and growing, and Netflix is still very small relative to that opportunity (for example, ~8% of total TV time in the US and the UK, two of our most established countries). In the 190 countries in which we operate, our $30 billion-plus of annual revenue is roughly 5% of the combined estimated ~$300 billion pay TV\/streaming industry, ~$180 billion branded advertising market, and $130 billion consumers spend annually on gaming . So, we believe that we have 6 a long runway for growth if we can continue to improve our offering steadily over time. As it's become clear that streaming is the future of entertainment, our competitors – including media companies and tech players – are investing billions of dollars to scale their new services. But it's hard to build a large and profitable streaming business – our best estimate is that all of these competitors are losing money on streaming, with aggregate annual direct operating losses this year alone that could be well in excess of $10 billion, compared with our +$5-$6 billion of annual operating profit. For incumbent entertainment companies, this high level of investment is understandable given the accelerating decline of linear TV, which currently generates the bulk of their profit. Ultimately though, we believe some of our competitors will seek to build sustainable, profitable businesses in streaming - either on their own or through continued industry consolidation. While it's early days, we're starting to see this increased profit focus - with some raising prices for their streaming services, some reigning in content spending, and some retrenching around traditional operating models which may dilute their direct-to-consumer offering. Amidst this formidable, diverse set of competitors, we believe our focus as a pure-play streaming business is an advantage. Our aim remains to be the first choice in entertainment, and to continue to build an amazingly successful and profitable business. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $557 million vs. $82 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) amounted to $472 million, compared with -$106 million in Q3'21. We 7 continue to expect FCF of +$1 billion for the full year 2022, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars and substantial growth in FCF in 2023 (assuming no further material appreciation of the US dollar) . Gross debt at quarter end was $14 billion, within our $10-$15 billion target range. Cash increased $300 million sequentially to $6.1 billion. Net debt amounted to $7.9 billion at the end of Q3'22, or 1.2x LTM 7 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6 Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia.

We funded the transaction with cash, which will be reflected in our Q4'22 cash flow statement. There's no change to our capital allocation approach. Our first priority is to continue to invest appropriately in our business for the long term, including new initiatives such as games and advertising, followed by selective acquisitions. After that, excess cash above our minimum cash levels (equivalent to roughly two months of revenue) will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.

Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F\/X neutral operating margin allows investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currency fluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by 10 (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: 2020 was an incredibly difficult year with extraordinary loss for so many families, new restrictions that none of us have ever had to live with before and great uncertainty. We're enormously grateful that in these uniquely challenging times we've been able to provide our members around the world with a source of escape, connection and joy while continuing to build our business. With 8.5m paid net additions in Q4, we crossed the 200m paid memberships mark. For the full year, we added a record 37m paid memberships, achieved $25 billion in annual revenue (+24% year over year) and grew operating profit 76% to $4.6 billion. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Average paid streaming memberships increased 23% year over year in Q4, while average revenue per membership1 was flat year over year both on a reported and foreign exchange (F\/X) neutral basis. Revenue was 1% higher than our guidance forecast, as paid net adds exceeded our 6.0m projection by 2.5m. Operating margin of 14.4% (a 600bps increase from Q4'19) also came in above our guidance, due to higher-than-expected revenue. EPS of $1.19 vs. $1.30 a year ago included a $258m non-cash unrealized loss from F\/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. For the full year, our 37m paid net additions represented a 31% increase from 2019's 28m paid net adds. We're becoming an increasingly global service with 83% of our paid net adds in 2020 coming from 1 Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of  streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period; it was previously referred to as streaming ARPU. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1outside the UCAN region. Our EMEA region accounted for 41% of our full year paid net adds, while APAC was the second largest contributor to paid net additions with 9.3m (up 65% year over year). As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q1'21, we expect paid net adds of 6.0m vs. last Q1's 15.8m, which included the impact from the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. Since the start of 2018, our paid memberships have risen from 111m to 204m and our average revenue per membership has grown from $9.88 to $11.02, despite significant F\/X headwinds. This approach has allowed us to organically increase revenue by $4-$5 billion annually over the past several years. We've made good progress growing our profitability with FY20 operating margin of 18% rising five percentage points over prior year. For FY21, we're now targeting a 20% operating margin, up two percentage points from 2020 and higher than our previous 19% forecast, due to a more favorable revenue outlook. As we said last quarter, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year at an average rate of three percentage points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate some lumpiness. Some years we'll be a little over (like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021), but we are trying to keep on an average three percentage points per year long-term trajectory. Content The big growth in streaming entertainment has led legacy competitors like Disney, WarnerMedia and Discovery to compete with us in new ways, which we've been expecting for many years. This is, in part, why we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a wide range of genres and nations. Our fourth quarter slate highlights the breadth and diversity of our entertainment offering. 2In scripted English language television, season four of the critically acclaimed The Crown was the biggest   season so far and drove new watchers of prior seasons. In its first 28 days, more member households chose to watch season four of The Crown than each of the prior seasons, helping to grow the number of   member households that have chosen to watch this series to over 100m since its initial launch. In late December, we released our first original series from Shonda Rhimes, Bridgerton. This title has proven   immensely popular and we'll have some exciting news about Bridgerton later this week.   Our largest original film of the quarter was The Midnight Sky, starring and directed by George Clooney;   we estimate 72m member households will choose to watch this title in its first four weeks. In its first 28 days, 43m member households chose to watch our animated feature film Over the Moon (directed by   legendary creator Glen Keane) with high levels of rewatching. We Can Be Heroes (directed by Robert   Rodriguez) was another successful family film with a projected 53m member households choosing this title in its first four weeks. Our holiday movie slate also resonated with our members; in the first four weeks, 68m and 61m member households chose to watch Holidate (starring Emma Roberts) and The Christmas Chronicles:    Part Two (starring Kurt Russell), respectively. Our first Portuguese language holiday film from Brazil, Just   Another Christmas (starring Leandro Hassum), was also a big hit with 26m member households globally   choosing to watch in the first 28 days of release. We continue to ramp up our local original content slate. Our top local titles this quarter include Barbarians (a historical action series from Germany that 37m member households globally chose to  watch in the first four weeks), Sweet Home, our Korean language horror show (22m member   households), Selena: The Series, which particularly resonated with members throughout Mexico and the   US (25m member households globally), and Alice in Borderland, a sci-fi thriller from Japan (18m member   households). While designed to be very impactful in the home country, we see many cases of our local originals traveling more broadly. For example, Lupin, an adrenalin-filled French language heist series   released in early January, has hit #2 in our US Top 10 list and ranked #1 in dozens of other countries including Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Vietnam, the Philippines and many more. We project 70m member households will choose to watch Lupin in its first 28 days of release.   In addition to titles with big viewership, we also aspire to have hits that become part of the cultural zeitgeist. In 2020 alone, we had Tiger King, Bridgerton and The Queen's Gambit. Not only did 62m       member households choose to watch The Queen's Gambit in its first 28 days (making this show our   biggest limited series in Netflix history), but it ignited sales of chess sets and inspired the next generation   of chess prodigies. In fact, Netflix series accounted for nine out of the 10 most searched shows globally in 2020, while our films represented two of the top 10. 3Google Year in Search, 2020 (Global)   Our productions are back up and running in most regions - we have learned that flexibility and adaptability are paramount in this fast-changing environment. With over 500 titles currently in post production or preparing to launch on our service and plans to release at least one new original film  every week in 2021 with extraordinary talent, we're confident we'll continue to have a great content  offering for our members. In Q1, in addition to the recently released season 3 of Cobra Kai and Lupin, we're excited to be launching     later this quarter To All the Boys I've Loved Before 3, the finale to this beloved rom com trilogy, our   young adult drama Fate: The Winx Saga, Yes Day (a family movie starring Jennifer Garner), Sky Rojo, a       thrilling new series from the creators of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist) and Space Sweepers, an       action packed Korean sci-fi film. Product Last year, we continued to improve our parental controls so that families have more control over their experience. These enhancements include allowing members to filter out content at the title level or by maturity rating, creating a profile lock PIN and customizing autoplay settings for any profile. We also extended parental control support to downloads to give parents peace of mind regardless of how Netflix is used. And we provided parents with more transparency into the themes, characters and content that their kids love with the Kids Activity Report, a weekly message designed to keep parents informed about the content their children are watching. As we bring our members more great programming, we're always listening and working to make it easier for them to find the right show and film to watch. That's why last year we debuted our Top 10 lists around the world, and in October we introduced the New & Popular tab in our television user interface, which includes a new Worth the Wait section, highlighting titles as far as a year away that you can remind yourself about. As another exciting step in this effort, we've been testing a new feature that 4gives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse. The response has been positive and we plan to roll it out globally in the first half of 2021. Competition It's a great time to be a consumer of entertainment. There are a wealth of options ranging from linear TV to video gaming to user generated content on YouTube and TikTok. We continue to work hard to grow our small share of screen time against these major competitors. Discovery recently launched its streaming service. Disney+ is expanding in new countries and with more    content. ViacomCBS will be unveiling its plans for Paramount+ in 2021. Combined with the launch of AppleTV+, WarnerMedia's HBO Max, and NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming services, this signifies that these companies all recognize the future is streaming entertainment, a vision we have been working towards since inception. Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment. This past year is a testament to this approach. Disney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid membership growth in our history. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$138 million vs. -$1.5 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow2 (FCF) for the quarter was -$284 million vs. -$1.7 billion in Q4'19, bringing full year 2020 free cash flow to +$1.9 billion vs. -$3.3 billion in 2019. We believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive. For the full year 2021, we currently anticipate free cash flow will be around break even (vs. our prior expectation for -$1 billion to break even). Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750m undrawn credit facility, we believe  we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations. Our 5.375%   February 1, 2021 bonds mature in Q1. We plan on repaying the bond at maturity out of cash on hand, as we are currently well above our minimum cash needs. As we generate excess cash, we intend to maintain $10B-15B in gross debt and will explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks, as we did in the past (2007-2011). Long-Term Stock Price Performance We thank our equity and debt investors for their trust and for coming along with us on our journey to build one of the world's leading entertainment companies. Since day one, we've managed Netflix for the long term under the belief that pleasing our members would lead to strong value creation for our fellow shareholders. Going forward, in each January investor letter, we'll provide an update on our long-term stock performance. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the  reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5Annualized Performance (%)* 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 Year Since IPO NFLX 67% 41% 36% 36% 40% S&P 500 18% 14% 15% 14% 9% NASDAQ 45% 24% 22% 18% 13% Cumulative Return (%)* 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 Year Since IPO NFLX 67% 182% 373% 2,054% 50,388% S&P 500 18% 49% 103% 267% 399% NASDAQ 45% 93% 172% 444% 830% * As of 12\/31\/20.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations,  including investments in global streaming content. However, this non-GAAP measure should be  considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted  earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

{"prompt":"The overall polarity score on the strict range (very negative, moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, moderately positive, very positive) for the text: In Q2, we eclipsed 65 million members, with over 42 million in the US and 23 million internationally. We are at the forefront of a wave of global Internet TV adoption and intend to make our service available throughout the world by the end of 2016. Our summary results and Q3 forecast are below. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast We added a Q2 record 3.3 million new streaming members, compared to 1.7 million in the previous year quarter. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we clearly under-forecast in Q2 (forecast was 2.5 million net adds). We strive for accuracy in the forecast and our Q3 estimates are based on everything we know up to today. We gained 0.9 million members in the US and added 2.4 million members internationally in Q2. We believe the higher than anticipated level of acquisition was fueled by the growing strength of our original programming slate, which in Q2 included the first seasons of Marvel's Daredevil, Sense8,    Dragons: Race to the Edge and Grace and Frankie as well as season 3 of Orange is the New Black. US      revenue growth was also driven by a 5% year over year increase in ASP due to uptake in our HD 2-stream plan. We continue to target a 40% US contribution margin by 2020, even though we are running ahead of plan given stronger than expected top line performance and lower content and other streaming costs. We are forecasting Q3 US net adds of 1.15 million, slightly higher than the year ago period. Our international segment is growing at a rapid pace. We did not add additional markets in Q2 but saw continued improvement across existing markets, including a full quarter of additions from our successful March 24, 2015 launch in Australia\/New Zealand. We project Q3 international net adds of 2.4 million. International revenue grew 48% year over year, despite an -$83 million impact from currency (+5% ASP growth x-F\/X). As we expected, international losses increased sequentially with a full quarter of operating costs in AU\/NZ. We expect this trend to continue in the second half as we launch additional markets (Japan in Q3 and Spain, Italy and Portugal in Q4) and prepare for further global expansion in 2016, including China as we continue to explore options there. EPS for Q2 amounted to $0.06 after adjustment for our 7-for-1 stock split (EPS would have been $0.42 using pre-split share count). We remain committed to running around break-even globally on a net income basis through 2016, and to then deliver material global profits in 2017 and beyond. Content We are making great progress shifting to exclusive content and expanding our original content, which differentiates our service, drives enjoyment for existing members and helps motivate consumers to join Netflix. In Q2, we launched our largest number to date of high profile Netflix original series. On April 10, Marvel's Daredevil debuted to strong audience engagement, particularly for a new show. Grace and   Frankie, the bittersweet comedy starring Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda which launched on May 8, also has  found a broad and appreciative audience around the world. Both series have already begun their second season of production. 2Our global expansion extends to our content strategy as well. Sense8, the mind-bending cinematic   thriller from the Wachowski siblings and J. Michael Straczynski that debuted June 5, is an ambitious, truly international show with talent behind and in front of the camera from multiple countries. Similarly, on August 7, we will launch in all territories our first non-English language original, Club de  Cuervos, a family comedy set in the world of futbol from Mexican filmmaker Gaz Alazraki, and on August    28, Narcos, a gripping account of the roots of the cocaine trade, shot in Colombia and starring the great   Brazilian star Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. The original documentary Chef's Table and our latest DreamWorks Animation series Dragons: Race to    the Edge are among our most viewed new originals to date. They are the perfect example of what we  strive for in our original programming; an elevated version of popular genres that reach a large audience globally. We closed the quarter with season 3 of Orange is the New Black, which went live on June 11 and set off   a social media shockwave around the world. On the following Sunday, Netflix members globally watched a record number of hours in a single day, led by Orange, despite the season finale of HBO's Game of    Thrones and game five of the NBA finals also falling on that Sunday. Global enthusiasm for the third  season of Orange underlines our ability to create franchise properties that bring new members to Netflix   as well as delighting current ones. Nearly ninety percent of Netflix members have engaged with Netflix original content, another indicator that we are on the right path. We anticipate that as our global content spend approaches $5 billion in 2016 on a P&L basis (over $6 billion cash), we will devote more investment to originals both in absolute dollars and percentage terms. This includes not only series, documentaries and stand-up but also original feature films. We are moving into the original film business in order to have new, high-quality movies that our global members can find only on Netflix. As with series, we've chosen to take a portfolio approach covering a wide variety of genres and based around creators with great track records and stories they are passionate about. The first of our films, Beasts of No Nation, a gripping war drama from the   award-winning director Cary Fukunaga (True Detective) and starring award-winning Idris Elba (Mandela,    Luther, The Wire) will be available to all Netflix members and in select theaters in October. In June, we  announced War Machine, a provocative satirical comedy starring Brad Pitt, which will be exclusively   available to Netflix members and in select theaters next year. The release schedule for our slate of original films can be found here.   Product In June, we unveiled the new Netflix website, our first major update in over four years. The new  experience has been built from the ground up to make it faster and easier for our members to discover great content to watch. The UI is a richer and more visual experience with improved title art and a better details view. It also works more like an app and less like a series of linked web pages. Early feedback has been positive from both members and the media, and retention should benefit. 3In support of expanding our service globally, we are focused on adding more languages, optimizing our  personalization algorithms for a global library in local markets, and expanding support for a range of  device, operator and payment partnerships.  We are also placing a greater emphasis on optimizing for  mobile, which is the main means for Internet access in many emerging markets where we will be  expanding in the future.     Strong Net Neutrality  Charter Communications made net neutrality history today by committing to open and free  interconnection across the Charter\/TWC network, if their pending merger is approved. This move  ensures that all online video providers can aggressively compete for consumers' favor, without selective  and increasing fees paid to ISPs. Charter's interconnection policy is the right way to scale the Internet.  It  means consumer will receive the fast connection speeds they expect.   The Charter\/TWC transaction,  with this condition, would deliver significant public interest benefits to broadband consumers, and we  urge its timely approval.     Competition  We compete with linear TV, PPV, video piracy, other Internet networks, video gaming and many other  sources of entertainment. The recent Sandvine results from North America show that, looking at just the  Internet networks segment, we continue to improve faster than others.  Note that this data measures  peak megabits, not peak viewing hours, so YouTube, for example, with more modest average video  quality, is underrepresented in terms of hours.               4  DVD  Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve 5.3 million members and provided $77.9 million  in contribution profit in Q2.  The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and TV shows,  remains appealing to a core user base and means that the tail on this business should be quite long.    Free Cash Flow & Capital  Free cash flow in Q2 amounted to -$229 million, compared with -$163 million in Q1. As we have  previously detailed, our investment in originals is working capital intensive, which results in higher cash  spent upfront relative to content amortization, and, we anticipate this trend to continue given our  increased investment in originals.  At the end of Q2, gross debt totaled $2.4 billion, which represented  4.6x LTM EBITDA and we ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash & equivalents and short term  investments.     Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: April 2015, January 2015, October 2014,  July 2014, April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013.     Summary  We're pleased to see the growing momentum of our original programming driving strong growth in the  US and abroad.  With our first set of international markets having achieved contribution profitability,  we'll be making our first foray into Asia this Fall with our Japan launch, and are gearing up to offer our  service around the globe.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 540-3700      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures  This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves, free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as these measures exclude effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However,  these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding US contribution margin growth; international expansion;  content launches; product improvements; content spend, including investments in originals; lifespan of  our DVD business; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid;  revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and  free cash flow.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions;  production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of  different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such  6  forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January  29, 2015.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual  performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above  and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking  statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.    7                                                                                                                                                          8 Netflix, Inc.
