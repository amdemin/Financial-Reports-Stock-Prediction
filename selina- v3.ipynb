The virtuous cycle we’ve mentioned previously of increased investment in streaming content, strong word of mouth and an expanding device ecosystem truly worked for us in the quarter. In addition, we spent record amounts marketing Netflix, per the margin discussion below. Looking forward, our prior period comps for net adds are going to get tougher, and while we expect our net adds the rest of this year to continue to exceed those of the prior year, it won’t be at a pace of nearly 2X like in Q1. With net adds forecast to grow every quarter on a Y/Y basis, we remain in the first half of the S curve of adoption. As always, we will remain focused on improving our service, keeping Netflix in the first half of the curve, and thereby increasing Y/Y net adds, as long as possible. Our pure streaming plan and a price increase on our hybrid offerings were put into place in November 2010, and the price increase largely took effect in Q1. As a result, our average subscription price increased sequentially from Q4 to Q1. During the quarter, new subscribers embraced the pure streaming and hybrid plans in roughly equal numbers. Going forward, we believe the ASP trend will revert back to slight Q/Q decline as pure streaming becomes a larger part of the overall subscriber mix. Domestic Operating Margin In January, we spoke of redirecting the savings generated from a flattening DVD shipment trend into additional streaming content and marketing. We took marketing up as much as was efficient in Q1. But as we anticipated in January, the lead time required to complete increasingly large and complex content deals meant we weren’t able to spend the entirety of these funds. That, coupled with stronger-than- expected subscriber growth, and hence additional revenue and profit, meant our domestic operating margin in Q1 increased above our 14% target margin to 16% (see graph below). Domestic Operating Margin 16.0% 14.8% 14.9% 13.0% 13.0% 11.6% 11.9% 11.7% 9.1% Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 2Going forward in Q2 and beyond, we expect DVD shipments to decline slightly Y/Y, spending on streaming content to increase substantially, and spending on marketing to decline from Q1, bringing our domestic operating margin back to our desired goal of around 14%. As we’ve stated previously, domestic gross margin also should return to the 30% -35% range as we spend more on streaming. Q1 Consolidated Earnings Outperformance Our consolidated net income of $60.2 million and diluted EPS of $1.11 were at the high end of our guidance range due to the earnings outperformance in the U.S discussed earlier. As we’ll discuss later in the letter, our international loss in Canada was right in-line with our guidance, with lower costs offsetting slightly lower-than-anticipated subscriber revenue. Domestic Streaming Content In Q1, we completed several important streaming content deals, bringing in additional first-time partners, extending and expanding relationships with other providers and pioneering some new approaches we believe will help Netflix continue to differentiate itself. The result is that Netflix subscribers can instantly enjoy a wider and better selection of TV shows and movies than ever before. Our agreement with CBS is particularly notable, as Netflix is now the only online premium subscription service that offers shows from all four broadcast networks, as well as many of the largest cable TV networks. The arrangement includes only a few on-air shows at present, but provides the framework for future shows to appear on Netflix while immediately unlocking a broad selection of classic television episodes. With Fox and Lionsgate, we increased the scope of our deals to increase the quality and quantity of TV shows available for our subscribers to stream, while obtaining off-network rights to five very popular on- air series, for the first-time in our history. The Fox deal guarantees all previous seasons’ episodes of the top rated show “Glee” and the F/X hit show “Sons of Anarchy” for years to come. This multi-year, non-exclusive, agreement ensures access to current and all future episodes. It is similar to a syndication deal, except that episodes are made available the season after they air, unlike typical syndication deals that do not begin until a show completes at least four seasons of broadcast. The first season of “Glee” and the first two seasons of “Sons of Anarchy” are now available to stream on Netflix. With Lionsgate, we obtained exclusive syndication rights for “Mad Men.” Beginning in July, the first four seasons of this award winning series will be available to stream, with new seasons appearing every year until the series is completed. For the first several years of our deal, those seasons will not be available to other broadcast or cable networks. Separately, we extended and made exclusive our current Lionsgate deals for the popular Showtime series “Weeds” and the Spike TV show “Blue Mountain State”. As streaming grows, TV shows and feature films are being enjoyed in nearly equivalent volume by our subscribers and our content acquisition team is focusing their attention accordingly. We’ve recently added lots of new TV episodes, and the profile and completeness of the shows continues to improve. As 3for movies, we’ve recently added a large number of core catalog titles from Paramount that are exclusive to Netflix against broadcast, cable and other over-the-top services and titles from Lionsgate and MGM that are exclusive against other over-the-top services. While the size of these deals and their impact on our P&L is often speculated about in the press, spending typically takes place over multiple years and the amortized cost of these deals is taken into consideration in our 14% target operating margin model. House of Cards Lots of attention was paid to our decision to license the exclusive rights to premiere Media Rights Capital’s “House of Cards” series, planned for late 2012. Rather than a shift in strategy towards original programming, our decision was driven by a desire to test a new licensing model using a small portion of our content budget. Serialized dramas, like the original BBC series on which “House of Cards” is based, have been big favorites on Netflix and we want to confirm our theory that because we are click-and-watch rather than appointment viewing, we can efficiently build a big audience for a well-produced serialized show . This represents slightly greater creative risk than we’ve taken in the past, but we think it’s reasonable given the popularity of the original BBC show on Netflix and the modest percentage of our content budget it represents. If “House of Cards” is popular enough on Netflix so that the fee we’ve paid is in line with that of other equally popular content on Netflix at the time, we’ll consider it a success. Ideally, we’ll license two or three similar, but smaller, deals so we can gain confidence that whatever results we achieve are repeatable. While we’re still negotiating the final details of this deal, both the P&L and cash costs would only begin when “House of Cards” premieres in late 2012. Cord Mending replaces Cord Cutting Given what’s happened in the music and newspaper industries, producers of movies and TV shows naturally enough fear Internet services will hurt their existing business. That fear was heightened last year when, during some quarters, total MVPD households in the U.S. contracted for the first time in history, leading to extensive speculation over two possible drivers of “cord cutting”: (1) the rise of entertainment available via the Internet; and (2) the recession, specifically the decline in household formation, rampant foreclosures, and the rise in unemployment. Since last year, online video use has more than doubled and the recession has receded somewhat. So, if online video use was driving cord cutting, the behavior would have intensified. On the other hand, if it was the recession that was driving people to drop MVPD subscriptions, cord cutting would have moderated. In fact, not only did cord cutting slow, it became cord mending with total U.S. MVPD households growing in the latest estimates. 4Simply put, the data shows that Netflix is a supplemental channel to MVPD. While Netflix is likely to show huge growth again this year, we think MVPD cord cutting will be minimal to non-existent. We hear some stories from customers who have Netflix and no MVPD service, but these are generally people who rely on free broadcast TV (which is now in HD) and supplement with Netflix, rather than switching from MVPD to online. Recently, the CEO of an MVPD characterized Netflix as “rerun TV”. While we don’t plan to use that line in our next marketing campaign, he is fundamentally correct. Our focus for TV shows is on prior season TV and completeness of series, because this class of content enables us to license content broadly and provide consumers a differentiated experience. Also, when we offer prior seasons of “Glee” or “Mad Men”, we think we grow the audience for current season on MVPD. We hope over time that HBO and Showtime will let us prove this proposition for them. We think more and more evidence that prior season on Netflix helps current season on MVPD will become apparent from our deals with Disney, Viacom, CBS, NBCU and others. Looking at it from all of these angles, content owners that license to Netflix make more money – now and in the future – than content owners who don’t license to Netflix. A few media executives are still vocal about their fears of negative long-term impact on MVPD subscriptions from Netflix, but the evidence continues to pile up against their concerns. Our subscribers overwhelmingly enjoy both their Netflix and the variety of sports, current season TV shows, news and entertainment available through MVPDs. Competition Over the past 12 months, both Hulu Plus and free video on Amazon Prime have launched. We also think Dish Networks is likely to launch a substantial subscription streaming effort under the Blockbuster brand. Our competitive strategy relative to other streaming services is simply to grow as fast as we can, so we can afford more content, more marketing, and more R&D than our competitors. Our biggest competitor over time may be another service with a similar model to Netflix, such as Hulu Plus, or it may be free on-demand Internet video as a part of a consumer’s MVPD package, namely TV Everywhere. This free bundling of a subset of our functionality within a larger subscription service is a classic way for an incumbent to leverage its strength. While TV Everywhere is not a strong offering today, it is likely to become much better over the coming years. We’ll continue to push ahead, developing an ever-better user experience to differentiate Netflix, and exploring exclusive rights, where it makes sense, such as our “Mad Men” deal, so that we remain complementary to MVPD. Several studios have begun allowing MVPDs to offer a premium $30 early window pay-per-view option for the home. Additionally, some studios are marketing titles on a PPV basis through the Apple app store and on Facebook. We don’t think this PPV activity will have a material impact to Netflix growth. PPV is a good way for content owners to maximize profits before a title is released for subscription. In PPV, the brand is the individual piece of content, a very different model from the subscription business. 5DVD was a Booster Rocket, but is not a Differentiator We believe that DVD will be a fading differentiator given the explosive growth of streaming, and that in order to prosper in streaming we must concentrate on having the best possible streaming service. As a result, we are beginning to treat them separately in many ways. Already, if you look at our signup page for non-members, it is all about streaming. Having said this, DVD rental is still a great business for us, and we are working on solutions to make sure DVD continues to be a profitable business for us in the years ahead, but it is not core to winning in streaming at this point. International Our growth in Canada was strong and consistent throughout Q1. Less than seven months from launch, we ended the quarter with just over 800,000 subscribers. We are still learning the seasonality curve and nuances specific to Canada, however, and we slightly over-forecast the quarter. During the quarter, we made great progress in increasing the quality and volume of content available to our Canadian subscribers. At the end of Q1 we began an output deal with Paramount, in which all of its movies will be available on Netflix streaming just a few months after DVD release. In addition we licensed several popular TV series from Sony, including “Breaking In”, and “Mad Love”, and from Fox, including “Prison Break”, “Firefly”, “Arrested Development”, and “Saving Grace”. In Q2, we will continue to increase our content spending in Canada and begin to incur some small expenses for our second international market, both of which are reflected in our guidance for international operating loss. Then, after achieving profitability in Q3 in Canada, we will stay at approximately break-even in Canada for a few quarters in order to further strengthen the availability of our streaming content there. We shared in our letter last quarter that if early results in our second international market confirmed our belief that we can reach positive operating income within eight quarters of launch, we would launch successive international markets. We also stated we expected to report approximately $50 million in operating losses for international in the second half of the year due to the launch of our second international market. We now anticipate $50 to $70 million in operating losses in the second half, which we are comfortable with given the size of the opportunity. We’ve also decided to make some early content commitments for a third international market given our high probability of success in our second international market. These third international market commitments won’t materially affect our P&L until next year, and we intend to launch the third international market in early 2012. Data caps Below is a recent screen shot of Google’s home page in Canada. You can see that Rogers, a leading ISP and MVPD in Canada, intercepted the Google page, and inserted the Rogers’ data cap warning screen at its top. It stands to reason that Canadian consumers subjected to such data caps – and outrageously 6high overage charges of $1 or more per gigabyte – will have a less positive view of Internet use and online video in particular. In response to these excessive $1+ per gigabyte fees, we’ve recently changed the default setting for Canadian Netflix members to an encoding that consumes only 9 gigabytes for 30 hours of viewing versus 30 -70 gigabytes for 30 hours of viewing under our standard encoding. The video quality is slightly lower but still very enjoyable. As a side note, data caps are actually a very poor way to manage demand and limit Internet congestion. All of the costs of supplying residential broadband are for supporting the peak loads, typically Sunday nights for residential customers. Bandwidth consumed off-peak is completely free; it literally has no marginal costs. If ISPs really wanted to limit their costs and congestion, they would limit speeds at peak times. But if their goal is instead to increase revenue, then making consumers pay $1 or more per gigabyte is an excellent strategy. When we state the marginal costs of residential wired gigabyte are below one penny, but are not zero, that is because we are making the appropriate costing assumption that some of an average gigabyte is transferred at costly peak times. Canadian consumers have been outspoken against the excessive charges they face, and hopefully Canadian ISPs will listen to them by raising the caps or abandoning them altogether. 7The initial response from our Canadian consumers to our move to go to 9 gigabytes for 30 hours of viewing has been positive, because it seems to relieve most of the fears of overage charges from their ISP. If the ISPs eventually abandon the caps, we’ll be able to provide the same peace of mind as well as the best possible video quality to Canadians. In the U.S., AT&T recently imposed caps of 250 gigabytes on U-verse fiber Internet subscribers, and 150 gigabytes on DSL subscribers, with a charge of approximately 20c per gigabyte over those limits. We’ll study how this affects consumer attitudes about Internet video, and take appropriate steps if needed. Comcast has had 250 gigabytes caps for years without overage charges and that hasn’t been a problem for Comcast customers or for us. FCF & Cash & Buyback Free cash flow of $79.3 million increased sharply on a Y/Y (108%) and Q/Q (55%) basis. The sequential increase was driven by higher net income, higher non-cash stock compensation expense, no interest payment in the quarter, and lower cash taxes, partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue. To help keep our cash flow strong going forward, we will continue to insist on close matching of cash and expense for our streaming content deals, but our international investments will slightly moderate our free cash flow in the second half of the year. Net Income and Free Cash Flow (in millions) $79 $51 $38 $34 $30 $26 $26 $15 $8 $22 $32 $30 $31 $32 $44 $38 $47 $60 Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Net Income FCF Our strategy over recent years has been to use excess cash to buy back stock. We took a break from that in Q4 2010 to reassess our cash needs and overall buyback strategy, but returned to buying back stock in Q1. The objective of our buyback program is simply to return money to our shareholders, similar to a dividend; consequently, we are neither price sensitive nor market timers. With this objective, we used $108.6 million in Q1 to repurchase 502,000 shares at an average cost basis of $216.48. Since it was bought throughout the quarter, it was just under 200,000 shares on a weighted average basis for the 8quarter-end fully diluted count. We plan to continue buying back stock, subject as always to an ongoing analysis of appropriate levels of cash. We ended the quarter with $343 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Business Outlook Guidance Domestic Q2 2011: Subscribers 24.0m to 24.8m Revenue $762m to $778m Operating Income $100m to $116m International Q2 2011: Subscribers 900k to 1,050k Revenue $16m to $20m Operating Loss -$14m to -$10m Global Q2 2011: Net Income $50m to $62m EPS $0.93 to $1.15 Other Guidance: - Domestic operating margin of approximately 14% - Our Canadian operations to have a positive operating margin in Q3 - International operating losses of approximately $50-70m in 2H 2011 In conclusion, we feel great about the growth we’ve generated, and are very aware that our success in a fast-growing market makes us an even bigger competitive target. We’re working hard to stay ahead. Sincerely, Reed Hastings, CEO David Wells, CFO 9Metrics Evolution As mentioned within the January letter to shareholders, in 2012 we will cease providing gross subscriber additions, subscriber acquisition costs, and churn. For 2011, we’ll continue to report on them for our domestic business. Net additions, along with revenue and operating income, are our core performance measurements.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities. However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. 10Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding subscriber growth; average subscription price; DVD usage and shipments; streaming content spend; operating margins; content acquisition strategy; cord- cutting/mending; competition; the fading differentiation of DVD; international expansion, including the timing of breakeven in Canada and content spend for additional markets; cash flow and payment terms; our stock repurchase program; our subscriber growth, revenue, and operating income (loss) for both domestic and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 .

       "  \"We are happy to report that Q2 was another great quarter for Netflix. Streaming is continuing to grow rapidly, and with the recently introduced price changes, we’ll be able to further increase the scope and quality of our streaming content. At the end of the quarter, Netflix had over 25 million global subscribers, up 70% from 15 million just one year ago. Our summary results are below: (in millions except per share data) Q2 '09 Q3 '09 Q4 '09 Q1 '10 Q2 '10 Q3 '10 Q4 '10 Q1 '11 Q2 '11 Domestic: Net Subscriber Additions 0.29 0.51 1.16 1.70 1.03 1.80 2.70 3.30 1.80 Y/Y Change 72% 95% 61% 85% 255% 253% 133% 94% 75% Subscribers 10.60 11.11 12.27 13.97 15.00 16.80 19.50 22.80 24.59 Y/Y Change 26% 28% 31% 35% 42% 51% 59% 63% 64% Revenue $ 409 $ 423 $ 445 $ 494 $ 520 $ 553 $ 592 $ 706 $ 770 Y/Y Change 21% 24% 24% 25% 27% 31% 33% 43% 48% Contribution Profit $ 93 $ 89 $ 98 $ 111 $ 130 $ 130 $ 152 $ 187 $ 213 Y/Y Change 38% 32% 38% 53% 40% 46% 55% 68% 64% Operating Income $ 53 $ 49 $ 53 $ 58 $ 77 $ 72 $ 88 $ 113 $ 125 Y/Y Change 54% 45% 39% 61% 45% 47% 66% 95% 62% International: Net Subscriber Additions - - - - - 0.13 0.38 0.29 0.16 Subscribers - - - - - 0.13 0.51 0.80 0.97 Revenue - - - - - $ - $ 4 $ 12 $ 19 Contribution Profit (Loss) - - - - - $ (3) $ (9) $ (11) $ (9) Operating Income (Loss) - - - - - $ (3) $ (9) $ (11) $ (10) Global: Subscribers 10.60 11.11 12.27 13.97 15.00 16.93 20.01 23.60 25.56 Y/Y Change 26% 28% 31% 35% 42% 52% 63% 69% 70% Revenue $ 409 $ 423 $ 445 $ 494 $ 520 $ 553 $ 596 $ 719 $ 789 Y/Y Change 21% 24% 24% 25% 27% 31% 34% 46% 52% Net Income $ 32 $ 30 $ 31 $ 32 $ 44 $ 38 $ 47 $ 60 $ 68 Y/Y Change 22% 48% 35% 45% 38% 27% 52% 88% 55% EPS $ 0.54 $ 0.52 $ 0.56 $ 0.59 $ 0.80 $ 0.70 $ 0.87 $ 1.11 $ 1.26 Y/Y Change 29% 58% 47% 59% 48% 35% 55% 88% 58% Free Cash Flow $ 26 $ 26 $ 30 $ 38 $ 34 $ 8 $ 51 $ 79 $ 60 Buyback $ 73 $ 130 $ 79 $ 108 $ 45 $ 57 $ - $ 109 $ 51 Shares (FD) 59.7 57.9 55.5 54.8 54.3 53.9 54.2 54.2 53.9 1Domestic Q2 results We were thrilled to add 1.8 million domestic subscribers in Q2, 75% more than Q2 of last year when we significantly increased subs by launching Netflix on the Wii game platform. The virtuous cycle we’ve mentioned before of increased investment in streaming content, strong word of mouth and an expanding range of devices continued to bear fruit. In the U.S., we ended the quarter with 24.6 million domestic subscribers, 64% more than the comparable previous year period. During the quarter, the streaming only plan continued to gain in popularity, with nearly 75% of our new subscribers signing up for it. As a result, our average subscription price reverted to a slight quarter-over- quarter decline, after the one quarter impact in Q1 of our November 2010 price change. With the rapid adoption of streaming, DVD shipments for Netflix have likely peaked. Also, in Q2 the total number of subscribers who were on hybrid plans (and, therefore eligible to receive DVDs) declined slightly from Q1. We’ve spoken frequently of how we are directing savings generated from declining DVD demand into additional streaming content and marketing. During the quarter, we substantially increased sequential spending on streaming content as titles from our new content deals (discussed below) became available for streaming. At the same time, though, we maintained a disciplined approach to what content we license and at what price, spending somewhat less on streaming content than we budgeted for in the quarter. Also, DVD shipments came in even lower than forecasted, in part due to the popularity of our streaming only plan. The net impact: our domestic operating margin came in at 16.3%, above our 14% target. Going forward in the second half of 2011, we expect to increase our investment in streaming content, thus reaching our 14% domestic operating margin target. Domestic Operating Margin 16.3% 16.0% 14.9% 14.8% 13.0% 13.0% 11.6% 12.0% 11.8% Actual Annual Targets Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 2Domestic content licensing During Q2, we secured great new content for streaming and expanded our existing partnerships with movie studios and broadcast and cable networks. For feature films, we reached agreements with Miramax and Revolution Studios to add several hundred movies on a rotating basis, giving our subscribers access to critically acclaimed films such as “Pulp Fiction,” “Good Will Hunting,” “Black Hawk Down,” “Across the Universe,” and “Shakespeare in Love” as well as box office favorites like “Daddy Day Care,” “Hellboy,” and “Anger Management.” We also announced a multi-year deal with Open Road Films to exclusively offer an exciting slate of first-run films to watch instantly shortly after they are released on DVD. The first films from our previously announced deal with Relativity Media have just started to flow and “The Fighter” and “Skyline” are shaping up to be big hits with our subscribers. Netflix members love great television shows as much as they love movies, and are now spending over half of overall streaming hours enjoying a wide range of TV programming. In Q2, we added thousands of TV episodes through significant multi-year renewals with Viacom’s media networks and NBC Universal. These agreements not only add new seasons of shows that have enjoyed great success among our subscribers, but expand to new shows licensed by these companies. In the case of NBCU, we’ve secured access to great NBC primetime hits on a prior-season basis, including “30 Rock,” “Parenthood,” and “The Office.” Complete previous seasons of cable favorites like SyFy’s “Warehouse 13,” USA’s “Psych,” and E’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” are also part of the deal. With Viacom, we’ve expanded our agreement to include a wide range of programming from MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET and TV Land, including complete seasons of “Jersey Shore,” “SpongeBob SquarePants,” “South Park,” “Hot in Cleveland,” and “Basketball Wives.” In a few days, every episode of “Mad Men” will become available in syndication exclusively on Netflix. Additional seasons will become available on Netflix once they complete their run on AMC. Since Mad Men is strongly serialized, we expect significant viewing of prior seasons as new viewers get hooked and seek the back story during the upcoming fifth season and beyond. Netflix subscribers now have access to a wide range of programming from all four major U.S. broadcast networks and from nearly every major cable channel, as well as thousands of films, including those in their first subscription window, from Paramount, MGM, Disney, Lionsgate and a host of mini-major and independent studios. In June, we told our members that Sony movies through Starz Plus would be unavailable to watch instantly from Netflix due to a contract dispute between Sony and Starz, to which we are not a party. As we said then, we are hopeful these two valued partners will resolve this issue soon. Additionally, we continue to be in discussions with Starz to renew our agreement beyond the first quarter of 2012. 3Domestic competition As we’ve said previously, our largest competitor over time is likely to be an improved MVPD service offering more Internet video on-demand, and thus reducing the number of people who will be attracted by a supplementary service like Netflix. HBO GO is an example of this: HBO subscribers can watch HBO on-demand through their MVPD provider web interface (DishOnline.com, say), or through the HBO GO dedicated application. Over time, both the DishOnline application and the HBO GO application, amongst others, will likely get built into smart TVs or be available in smart TV app stores. While HBO GO and Netflix do not have overlapping content, and many consumers subscribe to both Netflix and HBO, we do compete with HBO for studio content and for viewers’ time. Our task is to consistently improve the quality of our service and stay two steps ahead, so that consumers will continue to enjoy Netflix. We are also mindful of Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime. Hulu Plus added about 325,000 subs in Q2; we added close to 2 million. We invest much more than Hulu Plus in content, in marketing, and in R&D. Since Hulu is likely to be sold in the near term, it is unknown who will run it and how much they will invest in the subscription part of the Hulu service. We aren’t planning to bid on Hulu because most of its revenue is from providing free ad-supported streaming of current season TV shows, which is not our focus. Amazon recently added thousands of films and TV shows, and includes them as a free service to subscribers of its Prime shipping service. We have vastly more streaming content, are available on more streaming devices and are purely focused on subscription video streaming. So far, we haven’t detected an impact on our business from Amazon Prime. Separating DVD by mail and streaming into two distinct plans in the U.S. Earlier this month, we separated DVD by mail and streaming into two distinct plans, and we feel each one represents unbeatable value in the marketplace. Our new pricing, $7.99 for unlimited DVD by mail, is the lowest price for DVD by mail offered by anyone, and we have the best service levels. In addition, $7.99 for unlimited commercial-free streaming is an extremely attractive proposition, with our new subscribers overwhelmingly choosing this plan. Combined, for $15.98, these two plans provide a tremendous entertainment value for consumers who want both DVD and streaming. We didn’t change the pricing for our streaming only subscribers, and those members will get to enjoy more and better streaming content going forward. Subscribers who only want DVDs from us are happy with the introduction of DVD only plans, because they can pay $7.99 instead of $9.99, a 20% savings. It is expected and unfortunate that our DVD subscribers who also use streaming don’t like our price change, which can be as much as a 60% increase for them from $9.99 to $15.98, when it goes into effect for each subscriber upon their renewal date in September. 4Some subscribers will cancel Netflix or downgrade their Netflix plans. We expect most to stay with us because each of our $7.99 plans is an incredible value. We hate making our subscribers upset with us, but we feel like we provide a fantastic service and we’re working hard to further improve the quality and range of our streaming content in Q4 and beyond. In addition to separating the plans, we are setting up a dedicated DVD division, led by twelve-year Netflix veteran Andy Rendich, to focus on running a successful DVD by mail service in the U.S. for a long time. Andy and his team will be located nearby in San Jose, and are already planning some great improvements for the DVD service. Because we believe we can best generate profits and satisfaction by keeping DVD by mail as a division, we have no intention of selling it. In Q4, we’ll also return to marketing our DVD by mail service, something we haven’t done for many quarters. Our goal is to keep DVD as healthy as possible for as many years as possible. Our estimate is that by end of Q3 in the U.S., we’ll have about 22 million people subscribing to our streaming service, about 15 million people subscribing to our DVD service, and about 25 million total U.S. subscribers (with about 12 million people subscribing to both streaming and DVD). In Q3 we will see only the negative impact of the pricing change, given that the announcement was early in the quarter and that the increases won’t take effect until late in the quarter (September 15th on average). We expect domestic net additions in Q3 to be lower than the previous year Q3, and because of the timing of the price change, revenues will only grow slightly on a sequential basis. In Q4, we expect domestic net additions to return to a pattern of year-over-year growth while revenue will reflect a full quarter’s impact of the pricing changes, which could result in Q4 being our first billion dollar global revenue quarter, driven by strong U.S. performance. 5While we expect our revenue to increase in Q4 from this pricing change, we are still targeting a 14% domestic operating margin because we will continue to increase our spending on streaming content, ensuring the service remains by far the best value out there when it comes to enjoying instant, on- demand movies and TV shows. Q4 will also be the first quarter with a clean separation of the costs for our DVD and streaming services. In January, we’ll report on Q4 with greater segment detail, breaking out domestic DVD, domestic streaming and international streaming. Domestic DVD will incorporate its own technology and development costs, as well as G&A, providing a straightforward picture of operating income. Domestic and international streaming share technology, development and G&A expenses, so we’ll be reporting contribution profit (i.e. gross profit less marketing) for each segment as well as the shared global streaming technology, development and G&A costs. Starting this quarter, contribution profit has been added to our segment reporting as a new metric. Canada results We continue to generate strong subscriber growth in Canada, and we’re up to nearly 1 million subscribers in just 10 months. We continue to learn from our experiences in Canada in preparation for other international markets. We recently launched Canadian French support for our service, and Netflix looks great, of course, in French: The key to continued growth, both domestically and internationally, is constant improvements to the service. We’ll be adding more content to our Canadian service and now expect that we’ll come in at between $1 million contribution loss and $1 million contribution profit in Q3. 6Latin America and beyond… Early this month, we announced that we would be launching in Latin America as our second international market later this year. Consumers in 43 countries across Mexico, South America and the Caribbean will soon be able to enjoy unlimited TV shows and movies streamed instantly over the Internet to their TVs and computers at one low monthly subscription price. We will have more to say about this new market at the time of launch, but we are very excited about the opportunity. Specifically, Latin America represents a large and rapidly growing market of broadband households (currently, ~40 million), consumers there enjoy Hollywood content, and we are able to take advantage of economies of scale by licensing content regionally. As we said last quarter, we intend to launch our third international market in Q1 2012. Depending on content licensing discussions underway, we may launch one or more new countries in Q1. As in Latin America, we intend to offer a compelling mix of Hollywood, regional and local content. In April of this year, we anticipated generating international operating losses of up to $70 million in the second half of this year, which we were comfortable with given the size of the opportunity in Latin America. Our current estimate for international operating losses in the second half of 2011 is now up to $80 million which includes pre-launch expenses for the one or more countries we may launch in Q1 2012. New user interface on laptops In June, we updated the Netflix website with a new interface to provide more focus on the TV shows & movies available to watch instantly, making it even easier for subscribers to find something they’d love to watch. The title images are larger, there are more of them on the page and play buttons appear when you track over the title image. Star ratings, synopsis and other functions are also easier and more intuitive to access. We are always testing new approaches to improve the service, so we were very pleased that hours viewed have increased since the new interface was launched. We also received tremendous feedback, not all of it positive, on the change and are incorporating some of that feedback into making the user experience even better. We’re constantly testing ways to improve the website experience and the overall service. Facebook We’ve made great progress over the quarter on our Facebook integration and we’ll likely launch it before our next earnings report. At this point, we plan to launch this initiative only in Canada and Latin America, as the VPPA (Video Privacy Protection Act) discourages us from launching our Facebook integration domestically. Under the VPPA, it is ambiguous when and how a user can give permission for his or her video viewing data to be shared. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a simple clarification, HR2471, which says when and how a user can give such permission. We’re hoping HR2471 passes, enabling us to offer our Facebook integration to our U.S. subscribers who desire it. 7Cord mending For the second quarter in a row, U.S. MVPD households grew in Q1, adding nearly 500,000 additional households and deepening evidence that cord-cutting in the past was prompted by economic hard times rather than the substitution of over-the-top (OTT) services for cable. Since MVPD households are growing while online video use explodes, the data suggests that OTT services like Netflix are complementary to, rather than competitive with, cable television. In this way, the growth of Netflix streaming is no different to the prior growth of the DVD rental market – both supplemental to the programming offering of the MVPDs. Our subscribers overwhelmingly enjoy both Netflix and the wide variety of sports, current season TV shows, news and entertainment available through MVPDs. Netflix beating Bit Torrent piracy In May, analysts at Sandvine published a report on global broadband trends suggesting that people are watching and downloading more video over the Internet than ever before. Given the popularity of our streaming service and the growth we’ve experienced in streaming subscribers and hours viewed, we were not surprised by this finding. What did pleasantly surprise us was how we compared to other providers of Internet video. Our low cost, high quality, on demand streaming service has become so good that the largest percentage of the Internet’s traffic is for paid content instead of illegal free peer- to-peer sites like Bit Torrent. Over coming quarters we’ll see if we can recreate this “beat piracy” feat outside of North America. FCF & buyback Free cash flow of $59.5 million increased sharply year-over-year (74%), but was down 25% quarter-over- quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by lower deferred revenue, and an interest payment in the quarter, partially offset by higher net income. Net Income and Free Cash Flow (in millions) $68 $60 $47 $44 $38 $32 $30 $31 $32 $26 $26 $30 $38 $34 $8 $51 $79 $60 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Free Cash Flow GAAP Net Income 8The expected ramp up in our streaming content investment discussed in our January and April letters is reflected on our cash flow statements as a significant sequential increase in additions to our streaming content library: $192 million in Q1 rising to $613 million in Q2. The increase in library additions reflects several large previously announced content deals (e.g. MTV, Miramax, Fox, CBS & NBCU) becoming available for streaming, and therefore being recognized as assets on our balance sheet. Due to this increase in library assets, our streaming content liabilities also reflected a significant increase of $420 million related to all payments not yet due under these contracts. As a reminder, when a content license agreement meets the criteria for library asset recognition, we recognize the full value of the agreement as an asset in our content library while unpaid portions are recognized as liabilities. Since many of our agreements are multi-year, the additions will be amortized and the liabilities paid, in most cases, over several years. In sum, A/P and other non-current liabilities (long-term A/P) will increase as titles from new deals become available on our service. We’ve provided additional disclosures on our cash flow statements this quarter to help investors better understand the accounting for our streaming content licenses – specifically, we have broken out the change in streaming content liabilities from all other A/P and other non-current liabilities. We have also separated amortization of streaming content from amortization of DVD content. As we’ve stated previously, we continue to insist on close matching of cash and expense for our streaming content deals. Our Latin American launch will require some minor up-front spending that will moderate our free cash flow in Q3. We used $51.4 million in Q2 to repurchase 216,000 shares at an average cost basis of $238, and ended the quarter with $376 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Debt Our current $200 million of issued debt trades at a nearly 400 basis point spread to similar-duration treasuries. We don’t expect to issue additional debt while our pricing is at these BB levels. Since we used the $200 million for stock buyback at sub $100 prices, we are very happy with our debt issue overall.

IR Contact: PR Contact: Ellie Mertz Steve Swasey VP, Finance & Investor Relations VP, Corporate Communications 408 540-3977 408 540-3947 Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of free cash flow and contribution profit. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities. Management believes that contribution profit is useful in assessing the relative contribution to operating income of each segment by eliminating any allocation of Technology & Development and G&A expenses that apply across these segments. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. 11Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding increases in scope and quality of our streaming content, operating margin targets, subscriber reaction as well as impacts to revenue, net addition and subscriber mix arising from our recent service and price changes; a return to marketing DVD by mail; Canadian contribution profit; international expansion plans and estimated operating losses related thereto; our subscriber growth, revenue, and operating income (loss) for both domestic and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the third quarter of 2011. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers; our ability to compete effectively; the continued availability of content on terms and conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition and widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward- looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 18, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release. 12Netflix, Inc.

WWhat we misjuudged was hoow quickly to move there. We compouunded the problem wwith our lack of explanatioon about the rising cost of the expansioon of streaminng content, and steady DVVD costs, so thhat absent thhat explanatioon, many percceived us as ggreedy. Finally, we annouunced and then retracted a seeparate brand for DVD. WWhile this brannding incidennt further dennted our reputation, and causedd a temporaryy cancellationn surge, comppared to our price change,, its impact wwas relatively minor. Our pprimary issuee is many of our long‐term members fellt shocked byy the pricing changes, aand more of tthem have exxpressed thatt by cancellingg Netflix thann we expectedd. Because oof this, our revenue and prrofits in Q4 wwill be lower thhan we had aanticipated, bbut we’ll remaain profitablee on a global bbasis. In Q1’112 we’ll be lauunching in thee UK and Irelaand, as we haad planned. FFor a few quartters starting in Q1, we expect the costs of our entry into the UK aand Ireland wwill push us to be unprofitable on a global basis; that is, domestic profits will noot be large ennough to bothh cover internatioonal investmeents and pay ffor global G&&A and Technoology & Deveelopment. Aftter launchingg the UK and Ireeland, we will pause on oppening new innternational mmarkets until we return too global profitabiliity. We plan to do that byy increasing oour global streeaming subsccriber base faster than we increase oour costs. Investors and memberrs will be relieeved to know we are donee with pricing changes, andd that at $7.999 each for sstreaming andd DVD we cann move forwaard for a long time. Some inveestors have asked us abouut the combinnation or “hybbrid” offeringg in the U.S. In our currentt signup floow, we offer tthree choices: (a) streaminng only at $7.999, (b) DVD oonly at $7.99, and (c) both,, for $15.98. AAbout 7% of nnew memberss choose the $15.98 hybridd offering. OOne could arggue that this percentagge would incrrease if we reduced the price for hybridd, but if we were going to llower prices, we would do it on streamiing. Our futuure is in rapiddly expandingg streaming, bbut we will maake sure thatt current hyybrid subscribbers continuee to get a greaat and stable experience. As of today, less than hallf of our streamming subscribbers also subsscribe to our DVD service, and we expeect that numbber to continuue to fall, given that only 7%% of new streaaming subscriibers also currrently sign upp for DVD. We see a huge global oopportunity for our $7.99 unlimited strreaming service, as indicatted by reachinng 10% of Caanadian houseehold penetration in just oone year sincee launching sservice there. In the U.S., wwe’ll build backk our brand thhe same way we built it in the first placce: no grand gestures, just amazing serrvice day‐after‐‐day, for an inncredibly low price. Q3 Dommestic Resullts We endedd the quarter with 21.4 miillion streaminng subscriptioons and 13.9 million DVD subscriptionss. Unique doomestic subsccribers declinned to 23.8 million subscribbers, driven bboth by a highher than expeected level of caancellations aand a reductioon in acquisitions driven by the PR storm that engulfed our brandd and its impactt on word‐of‐mouth. In spiite of this, wee continued too experience year‐over‐yeear growth in gross 2additions,, acquiring 4.77 million neww subscribers, or nearly 20%% year‐over‐yyear growth. Not only waas acquisition up compared to last yeaar, but SAC off $15 was commparable to QQ2’11 before the brand hitt, and down 24%% from a yearr ago. New suubscribers aree coming for our market‐leeading streamming service. Domestic revenue greww 44% year‐oover‐year to $$799 million in Q3. Despite lower subsccribers than expected,, revenue wass within expeectations as suubscriber canncellations weere back‐loadded in the quaarter relative too our forecastt. Domestic ooperating proffit of $120 million, represeenting 15% operating margin, exceeded our previouss margin targeet of 14% duee to fewer DVVD shipmentss than expected, in part duue to fewer DVD subscriberss as well as lower overall DDVD usage. Q4 Dommestic Outloook In Q4, we are providingg guidance foor both our doomestic DVD and streaminng segments, and will be reporting on that basiss going forward so investors have greatter transparency on the reespective businessees. In the pastt, we have guided to a totaal domestic operating marrgin target. GGoing forwardd, we will be guiding to separate contribuution profit raanges for eachh segment, ass well as provviding guidancce on global nett income and EPS. Similarlyy, we will be ffocused on, aand thereforee guiding to, sstreaming andd DVD subscriptions, as tthey drive revvenue for eacch of our dommestic segmennts (rather thhan total unique domestic subscribers.) Nevertheless, we do anticcipate that tootal unique U.S. subscriberrs will be slighhtly up in Q4. We think DVD subscripptions will deccline sharply this quarter, as reflected iin our guidance, due to ouur price channges. Our weeekly rate of DVD cancellaation is steadiily shrinking, as the price eeffect washess through, aand in future quarters we expect DVD ssubscriptions to shrink moore modestly.. We don’t anticipatee any additionnal material innvestment in equipment oor other PP&EE and a majorrity of our DVVD library is ffully depreciaated; so at $7.99, the segmment is profitaable. We havve yet to decidde whether oor not to offer viideo game disscs. The decission will havee little financiaal impact eithher way. Wee still expect DDVDs to last a loong time, as tthey serve some unique neeeds for completeness, for simplicity, aand for those householdds without acccess to high sspeed broadbband. Our $77.99 pricing iss a full 20% loower than our nearest unlimited DVDD‐by‐mail commpetitor, and our service iss better because we have more distribuution centers annd, as such, faaster deliveryy. Looking at our domesttic streaming segment, we started the ccurrent quartter with somee subscribers who were mosstly DVD users, but paying for both DVDD and streamiing and not uusing streaminng enough to justify payying $7.99 forr it. Those suubscribers aree cancelling sttreaming, which reduces rrevenue and streamingg subscriptionns. This canceellation wave was triggereed by the debit and credit ccard bills arriving with our nnew prices. The wave peakked a few weeks ago and ccancellations are now steaadily decliningg. At the samme time, we ccontinue to seee year‐over‐‐year growth in weekly grooss additions,, demonstrating the continnued strengthh of the streaming value proposition. WWe expect strreaming net aadditions will be negative iin October duue to the canccellation wave referred to above, and aas the wave subsides and ggross additions remain stronng, net additioons will be abbout flat in Noovember, andd strongly possitive in December. Overall forr the quarter we expect slightly negativve streaming net additionss. Streaming 3hours are continuing too climb, as members who use streaminng mostly stayy with Netflixx streaming. OOur streamingg hours year‐tto‐date are up over 3 timees from a yearr ago, and sett new recordss most weekss. The contrribution marggin for domesttic streamingg will be low inn Q4, at around 8% assumming the mid‐ppoint of guidance, due to our increased sttreaming conntent spend. ((Note: contribbution profit is revenue less COGS andd marketing; iit doesn’t incllude our globbal G&A or Tech&Dev). WWe’ve been agggressively increasingg our contentt spending, annd in 2012 will nearly doubble what we’vve spent this year, puttingg us almost at par with whaat HBO, the bbiggest of the premium TV networks, sppends in the UU.S. and makiing the rangee and quality oof content onn Netflix the bbest it has eveer been. As wwe grow the domestic streamingg member basse over cominng quarters, wwe plan to take the streamming contribuution margin uup about 1000 basis pointss every quarteer. New Doomestic Conntent We have ccontinued to rapidly expannd new conteent on the serrvice both doomestically annd internationnally. Specifically, we have reecently closedd output deals with DreammWorks Animmation, Open Road, and Thhe CW, as weell as an ongooing deal withh AMC, all of wwhich will proovide a uniquue differentiator from our competitoors in the yeaars to come. AAs more moviies come fromm “mini‐majoors” like Openn Road, Relativity and Lionsgate relative to the big Hoollywood studdios, Netflix mmembers will enjoy a steaddy stream of ggreat new filmss in addition to the hundreeds of movies recently addded from parttners includinng Paramountt, Sony, Miramax, MGM, Universal, annd Warner Brros. In the nexxt few weekss, the new Johhnny Depp film “The Rumm Diaries” andd the epic actiion film “TheImmortals” wwill open in thheaters and bbe among thee films available tto Netflix subbscribers exclusively in thee pay TV winddow. Other reecent films incclude “Drive” and “The Killer Elite.” Curreent box officee hits like “Paranormal Acttivity 3” and ““Footloose” wwill also be cooming soon for NNetflix subscrribers. Our recennt agreements with AMC aand the CW wwill assure thee flow of excluusive – and adddictive – prioor season seerialized televvision in the cooming years. On top of shhows that havve proven exttremely popuular with Netflix members like “Mad Meen” and “Breaaking Bad,” liccensed from Lionsgate andd Sony Picturres Televisionn respectivelyy, we’ve added “The Walking Dead” from AMC and sseries that apppeal to teenss and young aduults like “Gossip Girl” and “Vampire Diaaries” from Thhe CW. Add this to just rennewed or expandedd deals with AABC, NBC Univversal, FOX, CCBS, Viacom MMedia Netwoorks, Discoverry Communiications, PBS, and Sony Picctures Televission, and we’vve added around 3,800 neew TV episodees to the servicce in recent wweeks. At thiss point, Netflix now offers prior season television content from all 5 U.S. broaddcast networks and 95% oof the U.S. cabble networks.. Netflix SStreaming CContent Quuality – 10xx of Starz There aree various wayss to evaluate the content oof a video‐strreaming serviice. One wayy is to focus purely on quantity, but that leeads to the liccensing of thoousands of raarely watchedd titles. At the other extreeme is concentraating solely onn quality, as mmeasured by the number oof Oscar‐nomminated or Emmmy‐nominatted titles we hhave. Instead, we think abbout the valuee of our conteent as a functtion of how mmuch a given movie or TTV series getss watched rellative to otheer titles, for hoow long and by how manyy members. FFrom 4that persppective, an Osscar‐nominatted film may bbe of less valuue to Netflix ssubscribers than “Pawn Sttars,” because ssubs are watcching the reality show morre than the Osscar‐nominatted movie. We have tthe Starz offeering within oour service, annd it is currenntly running aabout 6% of vviewing hourss because wwe have addeed so many otther movies aand TV showss (with no bias one way or the other in our merchanddising). In othher words, 944% of the timee members sttream from NNetflix, they aare watching aa non‐Starzz title. Includiing the Sony ffilms from Staarz, which Staarz removed ffrom Netflix sseveral months ago, the 66% figure wouuld rise to aboout 10%. From this perspeective, Netflixx has about teen times the streamingg content seleection of full SStarz, in terms of what connsumers actually choose too watch. Using a similar techniqque, we have analyzed all tthe video conntent offered through Amaazon Prime, including the TV prograams announcced but not yeet live. We have essentiallly all of this ccontent on Neetflix, and that ccontent contrributes a small fraction of Netflix viewinng. Specificallly, the dupliccative Amazon content thhat is available on Netflix rrepresents more than halff of hours viewwed for only 2% of our subscribers. Thereforee, when evaluuating Amazoon Prime as a competitive sstand‐alone ooffering, this low content seelection explaains why we hhave not seenn much usagee of Amazon Prime in our research. Hulu Plus is harder to aanalyze becauuse we think most Hulu Plus subs are ppaying to get ccurrent seasoon TV content, wwhich Netflix does not carry, such as this week’s SNLL clips, on theeir TV‐conneccted devices, rather thaan paying for the Plus‐speccific content. In this sensee, Hulu Plus ccurrent seasoon TV is just a complementary contennt model to uus, like sports or news subsscriptions. OOur prior seasson TV offerinng is far more ccomplete thaan Hulu Plus, aand our moviie content is vvastly larger tthan Hulu Pluus, but, again,, we think mosst people whoo pay for Huluu Plus are doiing so for lastt‐night’s TV episodes on thheir PS3, iPads, and otherr devices. Netflix is the Conteent Leader – but Videoo is not Muusic Radio stattions and teleevision netwoorks developeed with different content licensing moddels, and the online evoolution of muusic and videoo streaming seervices to a laarge extent reeflects that leegacy. With radioo, automatic,, non‐negotiaable, statutoryy music licenssing meant thhat there wouuld be no exclusivityy over the muusic played byy different raddio stations. Clear Channeel, for exampple, doesn’t geet Sony Mussic exclusivelyy. As music mmoved online from radio, the music labeels and majorr music servicces – Pandora, Rhapsody, Sppotify, iTunes, Amazon, annd others – coontinued this non‐exclusive practice, offering a nearly compplete selectionn of songs. In television, by contraast, the netwoorks (ABC, FX, etc.) have loong relied upoon exclusive ccontent to differentiaate among thhemselves. As video movees online, so ttoo has this practice of excclusive contennt. HBO has aan exclusive license to receent Universall movies that includes its oonline HBO GO, for exampple. Netflix has signed excluusive licensess for DreamWWorks Animation, for Relattivity, and othhers. In episoodic television, exclusives aare also the noorm. Netflix doesn’t license “Deadwoood” from HBOO because theey see strategic vvalue in keeping it exclusivve. Netflix liccenses “Mad MMen” and “House of Cards” exclusivelyy for much the same reasonn. 5We have ddramatically more content than any other subscripttion service or network, buut given the existing licensing struccture of the caable networkindustry, thee total contennt available wwill likely remaain carved upp between Neetflix, Showtimme, HBO, Hulu and others.. Two services can licensee jointly, or frrom one anothher, like Netfllix and Epix, wwhere it is in ttheir mutual interest, butto date that has been the exceptionn rather than the rule. While we and our commpetitors face the constrainnts imposed bby the traditional licensingg structure off cable, we have many aadvantages ovver linear preemium pay neetworks. We are unbundleed, and chargge a very low pprice of $7.999 a month. We are pure onn‐demand so we can creatte more comppelling user experiencces than a primarily linear channel. Wee are personaalized, so each user interfaace is tailoredd specificallly to the indivvidual taste of a given conssumer, helpinng them to eaasily find movvies and TV shhows they’ll enjjoy. Finally, wwe can innovaate at Interneet pace ratherr than cable‐sset‐top‐firmwware‐update ppace. We don’t have to “beaat” Starz or otther networkss to succeed. In fact, we ooffer significant value to thhe television licensing ecoosystem by crreating additional revenuee in the prior season windoow for netwoorks, which alloows them to iinvest in additional first ruun content. WWe won’t havve every movie or TV seriess; but we do proovide enough value that coonsumers alsoo want to subbscribe to Netflix. Any givven consumer will have onlyy one of DirecTV or Comcast, say, for their video servvice. That is cclassic either‐‐or competition. But with ppremium teleevision netwoorks like Netflix, the more ggood experiences there arre, the more consumerrs are willing to spend to hhave multiple channels froom which to gget enjoyment. Internattional We’re pleeased to report that we have over 1 million Canadiann members, aand we madee a small contributiion profit in QQ3 in Canada.. We’re excited enough byy the opportuunity in Canadda that, over the next year,, we are doubbling our quarterly content spending, sttarting by addding in Q4 hitt feature films in their first pay window,, such as “Truue Grit”, “Blacck Swan” and “The Chroniccles of Narniaa: Voyage of tthe Dawn Treader”, along with considerable high proofile feature ffilms just comming out of thheir first pay window, aand premiumm catalog film titles, as well as many TV series. By thhe time we’vee added all thhis great enteertainment, wwe will have ccomparable content qualitty to what wee have in the U.S., and be spending the populatioon‐adjusted eequivalent. Thhis investmennt will push coontribution mmargin back under in Canadaa for a few quarters, and our plan is to aachieve consiistent positivee contribution profit startiing in Q3 of nexxt year, two yeears after ourr initial launch. In early Seeptember, wee launched Netflix in 43 coountries in Lattin America. Early resultss indicate that member ccount at the eend of the year will be a litttle above Canada at the eend of 2010, wwhere we hadd far higher braand awarenesss from the sttart. Given tthat Latin America has aboout 4x more bbroadband householdds than Canadda, there is loots of room foor growth. WWe recently addded supportt for Androidin the regionn, with suppoort for Xbox and iOS to follow in comingg weeks, and are constantly adding neww content. Now that we are serving hhundreds of thousands of Latin Americaans, we can mmeasure what is getting ennjoyed a lot, aand what isn’t, and adjust our mix of coontent accorddingly. We are just beginnning in this maarket with a loot to learn, annd a lot we caan improve ovver time, so itt’s too early tto tell whetheer we will reach run‐rate break‐even within two yearsas we would like. 6We annouunced this moorning that wwe are launchiing in the UK and Ireland in Q1. The UKK is a large media market with about 26 million houseeholds. Abouut 20 million hhouseholds hhave broadband Internet aand video gamme console peenetration is vvery high. About 60% of hhouseholds subscribe to aan MVPD offeering from eitheer Sky or Virggin, comparedd to the roughhly 90% of U.S. and Canadian househollds that subsccribe to an MVPPD. The UK mmarket is simiilar to Canadaa in that onlinne piracy use is reasonablyy small and neearly everyone has a debit oor credit card,, unlike Latin America. In ggeneral, UK ISSP’s do not haave Canadian‐style low broaddband usage ccaps. Over‐thhe‐top video is more deveeloped in the UK, with greaater familiaritty and usagee for catch‐upp‐TV than in CCanada or thee U.S., with suuch offerings as the BBC iPPlayer and 4oD. In terms oof premium TTV networks, SSky Movies has exclusives for first pay wwindow featuure films withh all six major American stuudios, and offfers service sttarting at £166 per month oover Virgin annd Sky, attractting about 4.5 million subsccribers. In adddition, consuumers pay thee mandatory BBC license ffee of about ££12 per month. Finally, Lovvefilm has a liittle over 1 million subscribbers in the UK paying about £10 per month for DVD‐bby‐mail, as weell as a small bbut growing sstreaming librrary with thatt offering. Wee believe our service, att an aggressivve price, will bbe compellingg. As in the UU.S., it is not aa winner takees all market; UK members will subscribe to Netflix and to other eentertainment offerings. WWe have to atttract and rettain subscribers efficiently enough to bee able to geneerate a profit. While we normally targeet two years tto profitabiliity, with the increased commpetition in the UK relativve to Canada, we anticipate it may take longer. WWe’ll know more after ourr first few quaarters. TV Everyywhere Dueling Modeels in the U.S. We’ve wrritten before tthat authentication models for Internett access of caable network content would be our eventtual primary ccompetitor. The first of thhe two models for authenttication is thaat subscriberss use their MVPPD applicationn, such as DisshOnline, or CComcast Xfinitty, to access content onlinne from laptoops, tablets, phones, game consoles, Smmart TVs, and Internet set‐ttops. The seccond of the twwo models foor authentication is subsccribers use thhe cable TV neetwork appliccations, such as HBO GO or WatchESPNN on the iPad oor Roku or Sammsung TV. WWhichever moodel wins viewwing share ovver time will cconfer a lot off profit powwer on its owner, and the competition iis stimulatingg a lot of investment by booth MVPDs annd networks in TV Everywwhere. In the long term, Smmart TVs and tablets will bbe similar, offfering a wide range of vvideo applicattions via the IInternet, incluuding Netflix.. It’s slightly better for us if those other applicatioons are also “cchannels” likee ESPN and HBO, because they are on eequal footingg with us. It’s slightly worse for us if the other primary applicattions are EPGGs like DishOnnline, and Xfinnity, because we wouldn’t be in those EPGs. We remmain focused oon making ouur service onee of the best, in terms of consumerr value and eaase of use, ass the market ddevelops. Faceboook / VPPA UUpdate We were thrilled to announce at Faacebook’s f8 cconference inn September oour new Faceebook integraation that allowws Netflix subscribers in Caanada and Lattin America too connect theeir Netflix subbscriptions with their Faceebook accounnts. The Netfllix/Facebook integration eempowers Neetflix subscribers to share wwhat they watcch on Netflix wwith their frieends on Facebbook and commmunicate abbout that conntent. We’ve seen strong connect rates inn Latin American and Canaada, but we are in the early phase of integration in tthese 7countries and we havee yet to see juust how poweerful an impacct this will havve on the connsumer experiencce and our inddustry. We have ddecided not tto launch Facebook integraation in the UU.S., due to thhe Video Privaacy Protectioon Act (VPPA), a 1980’s law thhat creates soome confusion over our abbility to let U..S. members cchoose to automaticcally share their viewing history with friends on Faceebook. A bipaartisan group of lawmakerrs has introduceed legislation, H.R. 2471, a bill to moderrnize the VPPPA to allow suubscribers to mmake this chooice. We are pleased that thhis bipartisan group of lawwmakers recoggnizes the neeed to modernnize this law tthat has not keept pace withh technology, and that connsumers, the eeconomy andd innovative ttechnologies will benefit if it passes. Just for Kids Kids and ffamily contennt is a very important part of the Netflixx streaming ooffering, drivinng significant hours viewwed. We know that kids teend to have ddifferent viewwing behaviorr from adults; namely, kidss love to watch tthe same thinng over and oover again. More importanntly, kids idenntify with showws more by the characters than by thee title. With thhis in mind, wwe launched aa new “Just foor Kids” feature in July whiich provides aa more intuitive and enjoyyable way for children to wwatch all of thhe great age‐aappropriate TTV shows andd movies available to watcch instantly frrom Netflix. By clickingg on the “Justt For Kids” tab on the Netfflix website, kkids can find aa world of moovies and TV shows suiitable for children 12 and uunder, with kkid‐friendly geenres and sorrting by charaacters such ass “Dora thee Explorer”, “PPhineas & Ferrb”, “iCarly”, “Caillou” andd “Thomas the Tank Enginee.\" This new feature is just one morre way we aree improving oour UI and consumer expeerience to bettter connect subscribers with moviees and TV shoows they’ll lovve. “Just for KKids” is available on the PCC and Mac to Netflix meembers with similar functionality to comme on the Wiii, iPad and mmany other deevices in coming months. 8Free Cassh Flow Our streaming contentt offering andd the associated expense hhas risen drammatically overr the past feww quarters. We’ve addedd $1.34 billionn of streamingg content asssets to our baalance sheet ssince the start of 2011. In ggeneral, we hhave been succcessful in maatching paymment terms with the expense so cash use for streamingg content has been a bit ahhead of expennse but offsett by other sources of cash such as stock comp. Ass a result, freee cash flow haas roughly folllowed net income. In Q3, FCFF of $13.8 milllion increased sharply yeaar‐over‐year ((77%), but siggnificantly trailed net incomme of $62 millioon. Our Septeember Latin AAmerica launcch, with a full quarter of caash paymentss but only one month of amortizationn, was a material contributtor to this gapp. In additionn, we had approximately $$22 million in content paymments go out at the end off the quarter for content sstarting on the site in earlyy October, increasing thee prepaid conntent on our bbalance sheet. We expecct our FCF to ccontinue to laag net incomee for the nextt few quarterrs as our spennding on content continuess to increase bboth domestiically and inteernationally. As a reminder, when a content licennse meets thee criteria for library asset recognition, wwe recognize the value of the license feees as an assett in our conteent library whhile unpaid poortions are reccognized as liabilities. Since many oof our agreemments are muulti‐year, the aadditions willl be amortized and the liabilities paid, in mostt cases, over sseveral years.. In sum, A/P and other noon‐current liabilities (long‐term A/P) will increase as tittles from neww deals becomme available oon our servicee. We used $$39.6 millionin Q3 to repuurchase 182,0000 shares att an average ccost basis of $$218. Since inception of our share repurchasingg programs inn 2007, the avverage cost peer share repuurchased is $445. After the repurchases, we finished tthe quarter wwith $366 million in cash and equivalennts. Historically, we have always run a vvery lean capital structure,, returning alll “excess” cassh to sharehoolders in the formm of buybackks. We expectt to report a gglobal consoliidated net losss in Q1’12 ass well as to 9consume cash as we laaunch the UK.. By pausing on further intternational expansion andd halting buybbacks, our current cash on haand is adequate to supportt the growth oof the busineess. As we haave done in thhe past, we wwill continue to evaluate the appropriate cash level for the businness.

With our streaming growth, Netflix is leading the development of Internet TV. Members enjoyed over 2 billion hours of Netflix streaming video in Q4, which is approximately 30 hours per member per month on average. Every quarter we are improving our content selection, we are improving our user experience, we are learning more about social, and we are increasing our brand awareness in the 47 countries where we offer our Internet TV network.

October and November member trends were consistent with our expectations from our last earnings call, while in December, we not only returned to strongly positive net streaming additions (aided by strong seasonal gross adds) but exceeded our forecast. In particular, we saw fewer streaming cancellations, as well as lower migration to DVD-only plans, resulting in the outperformance for streaming members. The domestic streaming segment delivered $52 million of contribution profit, or 10.9% contribution margin. We exceeded our domestic streaming contribution margin target of around 8% due to higher than expected streaming members and revenue, as well as some under-spending in both content and marketing. Outlook We are encouraged by the strength in acquisition that we are seeing, coupled with continued improvements in retention among our domestic streaming members. For Q1 to date, our domestic net additions for streaming are tracking close to our net additions in Q1 2010 of 1.7 million net additions. Given this trend, we are comfortable with our ability to continue to expand our domestic streaming contribution margin. Since we significantly out-performed our 8% domestic streaming contribution margin target in Q4, we are increasing our Q1 contribution margin target to approximately 11%. Then, consistent with our previous guidance, we expect to increase the domestic streaming contribution margin throughout the year to deliver a trend of margin expansion that averages 100 bps per quarter. We will continue to increase our content spending sequentially every quarter, but not at the year-over-year rate expected in Q1 (more than doubling). Domestic Content Library As a result of the significant investments in our streaming library throughout 2011, our current domestic offering is dramatically improved from a year ago. We have a material increase in the quantity and quality of the content to show for our increased spending – most notably across on-air TV, kids TV and library TV. While our 2012 domestic streaming content commitments are already substantially in place, that doesn’t mean our offering will be static in the coming months. The relationships we’ve established with all major producers of film and TV in the U.S., including multiple output arrangements, ensure a steady flow of new titles to the service. The remaining Starz titles will come off our domestic service at the end of February. Since the Sony output came off in Q2 2011, the remaining Starz content is primarily the Encore catalog titles and the 15 current Disney Pay 1 titles. For the Encore catalog titles, we have plenty of substitutes and in many 2cases have already directly relicensed from the studios some of the top performing Encore titles. So, the only significant loss is the current 15 Disney output titles, such as “Toy Story 3” and “Tangled,” which currently constitute about 2% of our domestic viewing. Throughout 2012, Paramount will provide us (through our EPIX deal) with such successful family fare as “The Adventures of Tin Tin,” “Rango” and “Hugo,” which, with 11 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, is one of the most acclaimed movies of the year. And in 2013, when our DreamWorks Animation output deal comes online, we’ll strengthen our long-term, stable flow of great animated family film titles. More generally, the Pay 1 titles from our other output deals will increase in the coming months as EPIX, Relativity, Film District, Open Road and others provide Netflix with films that have already tallied more than $1.3 billion in domestic box office, including “Thor,” “Transformers 3,” “Captain America,” “Super 8,” “The Immortals” and “Footloose.” Last quarter, we explained that the evolution of video streaming services to a large extent reflects the legacy of television networks: namely, historical reliance upon exclusive content as a differentiator. Consistent with this practice, we are increasingly licensing content on an exclusive basis. Domestic Streaming Competition We compete for viewing time with a very wide range of providers. As other viewing solutions for TV shows and movies get better, we will face increased competition and potential decreased viewing share. On the other hand, if our service improves faster than others, we will increase our viewing share. One class of competitors is the other over-the-top pure plays such as Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime. We expect Amazon to continue to offer their video service as a free extra with Prime domestically but also to brand their video subscription offering as a standalone service at a price less than ours. Both Amazon and Hulu Plus’s content is a fraction of our content, and we believe their respective total viewing hours are each less than 10% of ours. In the case of Hulu Plus, subscribers have to pay for the service ($7.99) and still watch commercials (unlike, commercial-free Netflix). Even if Hulu could afford our level of content spend, at the same price consumers would prefer commercial-free Netflix over commercial- interrupted Hulu Plus. As we’ve often said, we see the biggest long term threat as TV Everywhere, and in particular, HBO GO, the leading implementation of TV Everywhere to date. HBO has some great content, particularly their original series, but today for most people it is locked behind a linear interface, or at best, behind a DVR interface and in all cases tethered to a linear subscription plan. As HBO GO grows and becomes the primary way that consumers experience HBO, it will become a much more effective competitor for viewing time. Similarly, Showtime’s TV Everywhere application is very impressive and just starting to gain traction. Every major network is investing in their Internet application, on tablets, smart TVs, phones, game consoles, and laptops. Pricing is simple: the consumer just authenticates with their MVPD provider. Over the next few years, UIs will evolve in astounding ways, such as allowing viewers to 3watch eight simultaneous games on ESPN, color coding where the best action is in a given moment or allowing Olympics fans the ability to control their own slow-motion replays. A decade from now, choosing a linear feed from a broadcast grid of 200 channels will seem like using a rotary dial telephone. Just as broadcast networks have substantially transformed themselves into cable channels over the last twenty years, both broadcast and cable networks will effectively also become Internet networks like Netflix. As a pure-play we have many advantages, however, just as cable did over broadcast. We are 100% on-demand and highly-personalized. Our brand is broad, rather than niche, so we can combine the benefits of multiple channels into one service. Additionally, our Internet culture enables us to create and drive social TV, recommendations TV, and other Internet innovations faster than our cable and broadcast network competitors. As cable networks developed, they were able to both compete with broadcast networks, and to bolster broadcast networks economics through syndication. Today it is accepted practice for networks to license parts of their content to other networks, if they get paid well enough. That is the world of content licensing in which we live. In that sense, we are just another network competing for viewing time with, and licensing content from, other networks. VPPA Update In 46 of the 47 countries we serve, members can currently enjoy automatic seamless video sharing between friends on Facebook, in the same manner that they can choose to enjoy automatic seamless sharing between friends of their music listening and news story viewing. As we’ve highlighted before, under a U.S. law enacted in the 1980s, companies that rent or sell physical video tapes or DVDs are subject to particular privacy rules. This law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, or VPPA, creates confusion over our ability to allow U.S. members to choose to automatically share their viewing history with their friends. A broad bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House recognized the benefits of modernizing and simplifying this law and passed H.R. 2471, an amendment to the VPPA that clarifies the ability of consumers to elect to share their viewing history on an ongoing basis if they so wish. Now this proposed amendment is with the Senate, and they have scheduled a hearing on the VPPA for next week. International Streaming In our 5th quarter since launching international operations, we reached 1.9 million international streaming members in Q4. Canada In Canada in Q4, we enhanced our offering with fresh movies and TV shows from existing output deals, as well as new deals. For TV, we’ve significantly improved our television catalog with new content from FOX, Sony, and AMC and for film, we have continued to add Pay 1 film titles such as “Black Swan,” “True Grit,” “The Chronicles of Narnia” and “Rango,” as well as great catalog titles like “Pulp Fiction.” The 4addition of lots of compelling new shows and movies both drove increased hours viewed per member and member acquisition during the quarter. The market opportunity in Canada is exciting enough that we continue to invest in the content library, meaning that we’ll run at roughly break even for two quarters, and we expect to return to a positive contribution profit starting in Q3 of this year, two years after our initial launch. Our plan after that is to grow our contribution margin as we continue to grow our membership. Latin America In Latin America, we ended the year with about the same number of members as we had in Canada at the same time post-launch last year. Latin America has about 4x more broadband households than Canada; so, our focus is on capturing a larger portion of the market opportunity. Latin America presents unique challenges relative to our other markets; namely, low device penetration, high piracy, varying preferences for subtitles, and relatively low credit card usage for ecommerce. We are quickly learning what content works best in the region, and are adjusting our content library accordingly. We have already nearly doubled our content library since launch, adding considerably more U.S. and local movies and TV. We are rapidly increasing the accessibility of our service by adding more subtitles in both Spanish and Portuguese (in addition to dubs), as well as expanding the range of Netflix enabled devices in the region. Finally, as expected upon launch, we’ve found that processing ecommerce consumer payments is quite challenging as compared with North America and Europe. To overcome this challenge, we are working with our local payment partners to optimize our systems, exploring adding new payment methods and testing various trial campaigns to improve conversion. We are committed to the region over the long-term, encouraged by the prospect of building a large, profitable business over time, just as DIRECTV has done. UK and Ireland Our UK and Ireland launch at the beginning of the month was very successful, and we’re seeing faster member growth than we did when we launched Canada. As our membership in the UK and Ireland grows, we’ll be able to invest more and more in content. We have a great selection of new films from Lionsgate and others, and will have on our service such highly-anticipated films as “Hunger Games” and “The Hobbit”, in addition to catalog movies from 5 of the 6 major studios. On the TV side, we have current Hollywood TV from the major networks and three key local channels. In the UK and Ireland we launched with our best Facebook implementation to date. The positive social effects get stronger as the number of connected members rises, so we are working hard on making connecting very easy, and the connected experience very enjoyable. Just as in the U.S. where our primary long-term competition will likely be TV Everywhere, in the UK our long-term competition will likely be Sky Go offering Sky Movies and Sky Atlantic on-demand. (Sky Atlantic is mostly HBO Originals content, and Sky Movies is one channel with the Pay 1 movie output from all six major U.S. movie studios). We believe we will compete very effectively against Sky Go, given 5our advantages of being an unbundled low-priced offering with broad content that is purely on-demand, and personalized. Over the coming years, we hope to be able to grow large enough to outbid Sky for one or more major studio output deals, as we did this year for MGM. Finally, in the UK, but not in Ireland, we also have the “free” BBC iPlayer and Amazon’s LOVEFiLM as competitors for viewing time. LOVEFiLM is primarily a DVD-by-mail service with 2 million DVD subscribers in the UK, Germany and the Nordics. iPlayer is an excellent over-the-top last few days catch- up service, free for UK residents. Total International Results & Outlook In Q4, international revenue of $29 million was in-line with expectations, while contribution loss of $60 million was slightly better due to lower content expenses. In Q1, the combined investments in both Latin America and the UK and Ireland will result in a total international contribution loss of between $108 and $118 million. In future quarters, we intend to continue to increase our investment in the content libraries in each market, just as we have done in Canada since launch. Doing so improves the consumer experience, builds strong word of mouth and positive brand awareness, and drives additional acquisition, all elements of a strong foundation for long- term success. As we improve the service, we grow membership and thus we expect the quarterly international losses to moderate slightly. DVD Q4 Results As expected, DVD members declined this quarter to 11.2 million due to the continued impact of the price changes, as hybrid members continued to predominantly choose a streaming-only plan over a higher priced hybrid plan. Both hybrid cancellation and migration to streaming-only plans ebbed through the quarter. We added over 600k unique domestic members in Q4, ending the quarter with 24.4 million. The domestic DVD segment delivered $194 million of contribution profit in Q4, representing a 52.4% contribution margin. The slight out-performance relative to our guidance was predominantly attributable to a higher ASP than forecasted due to more DVD members staying on 2+ disc plans. Outlook While DVD members declined sharply over the last two quarters, the weekly rate of DVD cancellations has subsided from peak levels in September. Looking out across 2012, we expect continued attrition among our DVD members. Specifically, in Q1, we expect net losses of DVD members of approximately 1.5 million, with the sequential decline moderating in future quarters. The DVD business model is predominantly variable cost based. So, as the size of the market opportunity continues to decline, we expect healthy contribution profit margins to be maintained. Meanwhile, for 6customers with DVD needs (namely, completeness, simplicity, and with limited broadband), our product is priced 20% lower than our nearest competitor, and our service remains better and faster. Earlier this month, Warner Home Entertainment announced it was moving the availability date for rental DVDs to kiosk and all subscription by mail services to 56 days post the release date for retail sale. This followed its move to impose a 28 day delay on store based rentals. While we didn’t like the new release date schemes, we decided that it was better for our members for us to maintain a direct relationship with Warner under the selling terms it has imposed. The alternative was to secure discs through multiple retail and third party channels, which can be unreliable and may have added to the time it takes to procure enough DVDs to meet member demand. We suspect there will be increasingly differentiated dates as the studios re-configure their shrinking packaged goods businesses. Product Improvement Constantly improving our service is key to satisfying current members and attracting new ones. The better we make the Netflix experience, the more hours are watched, translating into increased retention and strong word of mouth referral. In Q4, we announced several product enhancements to that end. We improved the Netflix experience on the Xbox 360, launching a user interface (UI) that is compatible with Kinect, allowing members to navigate the Netflix UI with voice and gesture. The new Xbox app makes substantial improvements in the streaming experience, reducing the amount of re-buffering, accelerating start-up, and delivering higher quality streams. We introduced a new UI for the iPad, making it easier and quicker for members to find what to watch, and we expanded our presence on tablets as a launch partner of both Amazon’s Kindle Fire and the Barnes & Noble NOOK Tablet. Following our well-received launch of the “Just for Kids” feature in July, we rolled out the feature to the Nintendo Wii. Additionally, we made updates to the Netflix app for Android which improved the user experience and increased the breadth of Android devices supported. Finally, we had several personalization algorithm breakthroughs for how we sort titles in each category, making it easier for our members to find movies and TV shows they’ll love. Original Programming Our first Netflix original series, \"Lilyhammer,\" a fish-out-of-water story set in Norway and starring \"The Sopranos\" mainstay and E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt, will debut on our service on February 6th in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. All eight first season episodes of \"Lilyhammer\" will be available at once, so Netflix members can enjoy the first season as quickly as they like, instead of having to wait a week for each new episode as they would with linear programming. More Netflix original series are planned for 2012 and 2013, including House of Cards (Q4 2012), and an exclusive and original fourth season of Arrested Development (2013). Our spending on original programming is intended to allow us to test a new licensing model using a small portion of our content 7budget. If “Lilyhammer” or “House of Cards” is popular enough on Netflix so that the fees we’ve paid for each are in-line with that of other equally-popular content on Netflix during the same time period, we’ll consider them a success. Global Profitability: Q4 Results & Outlook Q4 net income of $41 million, and $0.73 per share, exceeded our expectations, predominantly driven by the out-performance of domestic streaming contribution profit discussed above. In general, member growth or contraction in a quarter effects revenue the following quarter more than the quarter of the change. The sharp decline in DVD members in Q4 means that in Q1 our DVD revenue will decline by about as much as our streaming revenue will increase, resulting in approximately flat sequential revenue in Q1. Due to the increased investment in international, in particular the launch of the UK, our current outlook is for a consolidated loss of between $9 and $27 million in Q1. While contribution profit from domestic streaming will grow sequentially, it will not be sufficient to offset the sequential decline in DVD profits (~$50 million), and the sequential increase in our international losses (~$50 million), as well as cover our global G&A and Technology & Development costs. As a result, we expect modest quarterly losses, as well as losses for the calendar year. Until we achieve our goal of returning to global profitability, we do not intend to launch additional international markets. Q4 Free Cash Flow In Q4, FCF of $34 million slightly trailed net income of $41 million. Significant sources of cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation and an increase in accounts payable related to timing of marketing payments. These sources of cash were more than offset by cash payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense), a decline in deferred revenue and an interest payment on our notes. In the quarter, we continued to add to our domestic and international content libraries. For the full year 2011, we added $2.3 billion of streaming content library assets (or, $1.6 billion net of amortization expense) to our balance sheet. Since we have been generally successful in matching payment terms with the expense, the growth in streaming content assets also coincided with an increase in our content related liabilities of $1.5 billion, representing payment obligations under our content licenses not yet due. As we add original content in the last quarter of this year, we expect payments for originals to weigh on FCF as they typically require more up-front payments than non-original content license payment terms. 8Q4 Financing Our standard practice with regard to managing our capital structure has been to evaluate on an on- going basis the appropriate cash level and capital structure for the business. In Q4, given the pain from our price changes and the impact to our 2012 outlook, this analysis led us to the decision to strengthen our balance sheet by raising $400 million of additional capital from two long-term oriented shareholders. $200 million was raised through the sale of equity (2.86 million shares at $70 per share), and $200 million was raised through the private placement of zero-coupon convertible notes. We have no intentions to spend this additional capital; it is merely a stronger safety-net for an aggressive, fast moving business with a big opportunity. After the financing, we finished the quarter with $798 million in cash and equivalents. Metrics evolution As stated in our January 2011 investor letter, net additions, along with revenue and contribution profit, are our core performance measurements for each of our segments. This is the final letter in which we will provide gross additions, churn and SAC in our domestic results, conforming to how we have been reporting our international streaming results. Starting this quarter, we will be also providing guidance for paid members, in addition to our traditional guidance for total members. Since paid membership drives revenue and profit, we believe a focus on this metric is most relevant for our financial discussions. We will continue to report free, paid, and total subscribers by segment. As we evolve our focus from DVD to streaming, we are slightly updating our definition of membership starting with this quarter’s membership guidance. Members who are on payment hold will no longer be counted as members, while members who cancel mid-period will be counted until their service ceases at the end of the period. We estimate the net effect of these changes will be less than 200k fewer domestic streaming members than we would otherwise report in Q1. There is no effect on revenue from this change. 9CEO Stock Sales Reed has some 10-year options expiring in Q1, and will be making a one-time sale of those shares as part of a 10b5-1 plan, but is otherwise not selling stock this quarter. CMO Search As we announced last week, we’re looking for a CMO who today probably runs marketing at a cable network or a mobile phone network, and has strong global experience. Typically these searches take 4-6 months. In the meantime, our long time executive Jessie Becker is our Interim CMO, and is a candidate for the role also. Leslie Kilgore made huge contributions over the last 12 years to nearly every part of our business, and we’re very happy to have her join our Board of Directors to continue to help Netflix prosper.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities. However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       "  \"Netflix added nearly 3 million streaming members in Q1, bringing our total to over 26 million global streaming members, and strengthening our position as the world’s leading Internet TV network. We anticipate returning to global profitability in Q2, and plan to launch our next international market in Q4. We are constantly improving our service with better personalization, better user-interfaces, better streaming, and more content. As a result, per-member viewing hours set new records in Q1 and are on track to do so again in Q2, on a year-over-year basis. We launched our service in the UK and Ireland in January and are very pleased that, after the first 90 days, we had substantially more members than we had after the first 90 days of Canada or Latin America.

New content additions, steady improvement to the Netflix user-interfaces and personalization algorithms, and the receding impact of last year’s brand hit, all continue to contribute to incremental improvements in our domestic streaming business and the resulting member growth. The domestic streaming segment delivered $67 million of contribution profit, equivalent to a 13% contribution margin. We exceeded our domestic streaming contribution margin target of around 11%, due to slightly lower than expected content, delivery, and customer service expenses. Outlook – Increased Seasonality in Net Adds We anticipate that U.S. streaming contribution margin will expand in Q2 to about 15%. For Q3 onward, we are targeting 100 bps of average margin expansion per quarter, consistent with our January guidance. We think our 2012 domestic streaming net adds will be about the same as in 2010 (about 7 million), and that gross adds will approximately follow the 2010 seasonal pattern. At the same time, we have more net add quarterly seasonality this year due to our larger starting membership base for the same amount of annual net adds. In other words, given the same gross add quarterly distribution as in 2010, and the same annual net adds, it is inherent that the quarterly variation in net adds is amplified. We have included an appendix at the end of this letter to illustrate this. Due to this increased net add quarterly seasonality, Q2 net adds will be below those of 2010, despite Q2 gross adds following the traditional seasonal pattern, and despite us expecting to match 2010 in annual net additions. We see nothing new or particularly concerning this quarter to date in our member viewing, acquisition and retention. All are healthy. Domestic Content Library As a result of the significant investments in our streaming library over the last 18 months, we have meaningfully increased the quantity and quality of the TV shows and movies on the service. Going forward, we continue to sign new agreements to bolster our content offering, while also benefiting from our established relationships with all major producers of film and TV in the U.S. that continue to ensure a steady flow of new titles to the service. As we stated in our January letter, we are growing content 2spend sequentially every quarter, but slower than domestic streaming revenue growth to allow for margin expansion. Feature Films In Q1, we added several notable new release Pay TV 1 feature film titles to the service, including Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature, “Rango”, “The Lincoln Lawyer”, and “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never”. Meanwhile, our studio partners continue to provide additional high quality catalog product. We recently announced a new multi-year licensing agreement with The Weinstein Company that will make foreign language, documentary and certain other movies exclusively available for Netflix members in the U.S. As a result, this year’s Academy Award winner for Best Picture “The Artist” and Best Documentary “Undefeated” will be shown in their Pay TV 1 window exclusively on Netflix. Looking forward to Q2, the volume of exclusive titles we receive through agreements with several mini- major distributors will steadily increase. Notably, the action-thriller “Killer Elite” distributed by Open Road Films will come to Netflix along with several films from Film District including Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, “In the Land of Blood and Honey”, critically acclaimed action- drama, “Drive”, and “The Rum Diary” starring Johnny Depp. Meanwhile, titles arriving from Epix are getting even better with “Thor” and “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”, also coming this quarter. The Starz deal for 15 Disney Pay TV 1 output titles, plus some catalog films, ended in February. There was no discernible change in churn or viewing levels. Instead, the trend towards watching episodic TV, like “Breaking Bad”, on Netflix continues to grow. On a year-over-year basis, our content is stronger than it has ever been, and our viewing per member is at a record high level. TV Content Our selection of TV content also got stronger in Q1, as we added shows like “Supernatural” and “90210” from the CW, “Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior” and the Showtime series “United States of Tara” from CBS, AMC’s “The Killing” and A&E’s “Breakout Kings” from Fox, “Being Human (U.S.)” from Muse Entertainment, and Comedy Central’s “Workaholics” from Viacom Media Networks. Meanwhile, we continue to add new seasons of existing series every quarter. In addition, we recently announced our first deal with Hasbro, providing Netflix with a wide variety of new kids content including “My Little Pony” and “Transformers: Prime”. In the past, we have said that our licensing of complete back seasons of on-air TV series is not only a great experience for Netflix members, but can help build the audience for new seasons. We saw this demonstrated recently with the premiere of Season 5 of “Mad Men” on AMC achieving its biggest audience yet (20% higher than last season’s premiere), subsequent to the first four seasons becoming available on Netflix last summer. Even now, the most watched episode of “Mad Men” on any given day on Netflix is the first episode of the first season. This means we are still growing the fan base for this show nearly 6 years after it first premiered on television. 3Domestic Streaming Competition We compete for consumers’ viewing time with a very wide range of video sources, including linear TV (MVPD and free-to-air), DVR, over-the-top (OTT) pure plays such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant Video, and authenticated streaming offerings of the MVPDs and cable networks (TV Everywhere). Hulu launched its first original series, and has continued its platform (Wii) and country (Japan) expansion. While we have ten times more domestic paid members, and we added over three times more domestic net additions than Hulu in Q1, we do watch them carefully. Most of their viewing, we believe, is from current-season broadcast-network content. Amazon continues to grow its U.S. video content library available through Amazon Prime. We think they are still substantially behind Hulu in viewing hours. Given Amazon’s size and ambitions, we continue to track their progress carefully as well. As we’ve often said, we see the biggest long-term competition for viewing hours from MVPDs and cable networks through their TV Everywhere offerings. Consistent with this view, we began to see the consumer promise of TV Everywhere emerge in Q1, with all major networks and many MVPDs investing in their Internet applications and taking steps to evolve to Internet TV networks. Among recent developments, both HBO GO as well as Comcast’s Xfinity application became available on the Xbox. Additionally, Comcast announced its Streampix streaming service available to current Comcast subscribers. Given the superiority of our content selection, user interfaces and device ubiquity, we don’t currently see any meaningful near-term impact on our business from these developments. Internet Caps Should Apply Equally, or Not At All. Comcast caps its residential broadband customers at 250 gigabytes per month. On the Xbox, the Netflix app, the Hulu app, and the HBO GO app, are all subject to this cap. But Comcast has decided that its own Xfinity Xbox app is not subject to this 250 gigabyte cap. This is not neutral in any sense. The Xbox is a pure Internet device with a single IP address, works over a consumer’s home wifi, and data to the Xbox is Internet data. When the Xfinity Xbox app uses lots of bandwidth, it competes for that bandwidth with all other Internet usage and users in the home. The Xfinity Xbox app “speaks” TCP/IP like any other Internet device. The only difference between the Xfinity Xbox data and Netflix Xbox data is the Xfinity data is favored by Comcast exempting it from the cap. Comcast could raise the cap and make it apply equally or just eliminate the caps. Net neutrality principles mean a level playing field for all Internet applications. International Streaming We surpassed 3 million total international streaming members this quarter, growing 65% sequentially, and adding 1.2 million total net additions (and nearly 1 million paid net additions). Just six quarters after our first international market launch, our non-U.S. members account for nearly 12% of total (and 10% of paid) Netflix streaming members. 4UK and Ireland The largest driver of growth in international members in Q1 was the launch of our service in the UK and Ireland at the beginning of January. From the start, we achieved the highest net additions we’ve ever seen in the first 90 days of an international market launch. While the UK is a very competitive market, we have found that the existence of competition can be beneficial for driving interest and demand in our service. The existence of other over-the-top (OTT) streaming and on-demand services creates a high level of product understanding and acceptance among consumers and that, in turn, increases their willingness to try Netflix. In January, we launched with an impressive and diverse base of movies and TV shows, and as our membership continues to grow, we’ll be able to add further to the content library. Lately, we’ve offered members new movies from our existing deals, including Pay TV 1 and 2 titles like “Insidious”, “Horrid Henry: The Movie”, and “Angels & Demons”, as well as iconic catalog titles, such as, “Pulp Fiction”, “The Godfather”, and “Top Gun”. In the coming months, Netflix will be the Pay TV 1 UK home of “21 Jump Street” and “The Hobbit” from MGM, “The Woman in Black” from Momentum and the recent monster hit “Hunger Games” from Lionsgate. Collectively, our upcoming offerings account for 20% of UK box office year to date, compared to our competitor LOVEFiLM, whose deals we estimate account for around 6%. Our TV offering is also strong, with previous seasons of current shows from the major U.S. networks and three key local channels. We are particularly excited to be the UK and Ireland TV premiere destination for shows like, “Breaking Bad” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”. From our experience to date, we continue to believe our biggest competitors will be Sky Movies and Sky Atlantic (and potentially Sky’s yet-to-be-launched Now TV streaming service), as well as LOVEFiLM. Without details on consumer pricing or content selection, it remains unclear whether Sky’s Now TV will be a meaningful competitor. Ultimately, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in the UK and Ireland based on our content selection as well as our superior streaming technology. If the UK Competition Commission eventually forces Sky Movies to not control the Pay TV 1 output from all six major studios, that then may provide an opportunity for Netflix to bid earlier for major studio deals than otherwise would have been the case. It is premature to know how it will play out. In the UK and Ireland we launched with our most broad-scale Facebook integration to date, and are pleased with the level of consumer engagement. Social TV show and movie discovery is heavily used by our Facebook connected members. Canada Canada continues to be a strong market for Netflix. Member growth remained healthy in Q1, and we ended the quarter with nearly double the members we had a year ago. 5Our on-going investment in new content for Canada is driving increased engagement and hours viewed. Just this month, through our Pay TV 1 deals we’ve added such blockbusters as, “Thor”, and “Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon”, with “Kung-Fu Panda II” and “Captain America” coming soon. We are also licensing for our members some great Canadian content, including “Dragon’s Den”, “Arctic Air”, and “Mr. D,” three of the top rated shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC). Even with our continued content investment, we anticipate a small contribution profit in Canada in Q2 and will remain profitable in this market going forward. This is a quarter earlier than our January expectations for Canadian profitability, made possible by the continued strength of member growth and increased efficiency of our marketing spend. Long-term, we intend to steadily increase our contribution margin in much the same way as we are doing for our U.S. streaming business. Latin America As mentioned in our January investor letter, Latin America differs significantly from our other markets. While there is limited current OTT streaming competition in the region (different from the UK), this lack of OTT competition means that the concept of on-demand streaming video (outside of piracy and YouTube) is nascent, requiring us to do more work in driving consumer understanding and acceptance of our streaming service. In addition, Latin America presents unique infrastructure challenges relative to our other markets; namely, low device penetration, under-developed Internet infrastructure and relatively low credit card usage as well as general consumer payment challenges for ecommerce. For example, many banks turn down all ecommerce debit card transactions due to fraud risk, making it a more challenging environment than our other markets. To offset these challenges and improve the consumer experience, we have been continually expanding the content offering. In Q1, we added new series to our TV offerings including, “Dexter”, “Ancient Aliens” and “Charmed”, as well a host of popular feature films including, “Twilight: New Moon”, “Gnomeo & Juliet”, “The Incredibles”, “Insidious”, “Couples Retreat”, and “Saving Private Perez” (the top Mexican film of 2011). For Q2, we are beginning to ramp up the number of Pay TV 1 titles on our service, including Best Picture winner “The Artist” in June; and “Something Borrowed”, and “From Prada to Nada”, during the quarter. In Q1, we increased our subtitle coverage to nearly 100% of non-kids English language content (in addition to previously available dubbing) to accommodate varying viewing preferences. Finally, we’re very focused on optimizing our payment processing to continue to improve free trial conversions to paid members, as well as exploring adding new payment methods to expand the addressable market of consumers. Our revenue and membership is growing in Latin America, and we are rapidly learning. The odds of us building a large, profitable business in Latin America are very good, but it will take longer than we initially thought. 6Total International Results & Outlook In Q1, international revenue of $43 million was up more than 3X from a year ago, and in-line with expectations. Contribution loss of $103 million was better than anticipated due to slightly higher revenue combined with lower than expected content, subtitling and marketing expenses. In connection with our Latin American market, we incurred increased subtitling costs in Q1 which have been capitalized into the content library ($5 million, net of amortization). Last year, such costs were immaterial and expensed as incurred. We expect subtitling costs to continue to be meaningful as we launch additional non-English markets in the future. So, our forecast incorrectly assumed $5 million in expense. In Q2, we expect Canada to deliver a small profit, and the growth of members and revenue in Latin America and the UK and Ireland to lower the contribution loss in each of those markets. In total, international contribution loss is expected to sequentially improve to a range of between ($98) and ($86) million. Our early success in Canada – sustainably profitable less than 2 years after launch – is probably unusual given the proximity of Canada to the U.S. and the broad pre-launch awareness of our brand. As a result, we expect Latin America and the UK and Ireland to take longer than 8 quarters to reach sustained profits as we build membership and invest in content improvements. Given our expected return to global profitability in Q2, and how well we’ve been received in the UK, we’ve decided to open an additional attractive European market in Q4 of this year. Assuming continued success, and additional markets we can enter with confidence, we expect to roughly match the roll-out of new markets to global profitability for the foreseeable future. DVD DVD members declined this quarter to 10.1 million, slightly better than our expectations. About 7 million of these 10 million also subscribe to our streaming service. Going forward, we believe DVD will continue to decline but at a slower pace than the past few quarters. The domestic DVD segment delivered $146 million of contribution profit in Q1, representing a 46% contribution margin. We expect contribution margin to be roughly flat in coming quarters. Product Improvement & Partnering We are constantly working to improve the Netflix experience so our members can easily sign up, find something great to watch and then relax and enjoy our service. Q1 was no exception in terms of continual improvements to the service. As mentioned above, we improved our Latin American customer experience by increasing subtitle coverage to nearly one hundred percent of non-kids content, while in the UK and Ireland, we launched our most thorough Facebook integration to date, allowing members to share what they watch on 7Facebook and giving them the ability to get great viewing ideas from their friends. We also continued our efforts to better serve families, launching our “Just for Kids” feature on the PS3 as a follow up to the successful launches of this feature on the website, Apple TV, and Wii. Finally, based on successful test results, we rolled out a smarter personalization algorithm to determine members’ Top 10 suggested title lists. In March, we launched a deeper integration with the Apple TV, allowing consumers to sign up for Netflix directly on device and pay via their iTunes account. We’ve been very pleased that this simplification for new users has been popular, and that the integration has gone so well. Members who sign up through Apple TV are full Netflix members, and can use Netflix on multiple devices. The Apple TV relationship covers all of our markets. Many companies like Apple already have a billing relationship with millions of people, including ISPs, major retailers, MVPDs, and others. In cases where these firms have an efficient means to generate demand for Netflix, and can provide a very simple way to add a Netflix line item to the existing bill, it may make sense for us to let them bill on our behalf. We’ll take it slowly; we must make sure we’ve got the right customer support and financial integration, while maintaining a direct relationship with our members, to ensure the member experience is actually simpler. Our Apple TV integration is one example where we have accomplished that. Original Programming When we embarked on original programming, it was a strategic experiment. We’ve gained enough confidence and perspective that we now view it as a strategic expansion. In particular, we are now treating it as a capability we should build, like international, to achieve our long-term ambitions. What is still uncertain is when or whether we will take it beyond 5% of our large content spend. We’ll take it year by year, and see how good we can get at originals for our members. One way to think of originals is in terms of brand halo. If we are able to generate critical success for our originals, it will elevate our consumer brand and drive incremental members to the service. That took HBO nearly a decade to accomplish, so we don’t expect overnight results. The breadth of media coverage we already get, though, for the highly anticipated new season of “Arrested Development”, as well as for “Lilyhammer” and “House of Cards”, has been great. Another way to think of originals is vertical integration; can we remove enough inefficiency from the show launch process that we can acquire content more cheaply through licensing shows directly rather than going through distributors who have already launched a show? Our on-demand and personalized platform means that we don’t have to assemble a mass audience at say, 8pm on Sunday, to watch the first episode. Instead, we can give producers the opportunity to deliver us great serialized shows and we can cost-efficiently build demand over time, with members discovering these new franchises much in the same way they’ve discovered and come to love shows like “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.” In this regard, we are happy to report that in terms of cost per viewing hour, which is how we evaluate content 8efficiency, “Lilyhammer” so far performs in line with similar premium exclusive content that we currently license. Finally, a third way to think about originals is as a hedge, in case, say, FX chooses not to license us prior seasons of their next hit as good as “Sons of Anarchy”. FX in this case would seek to monetize prior seasons of their next hit in parallel to how HBO does, in other words, only on “FX GO”. As long as we can better monetize prior seasons, through both scale and technology, than anyone else, then this scenario is not likely, except from a premium TV competitor like HBO that is strategically motivated to impede our growth. We know we have a lot to learn in the originals area. In terms of early results, we exceeded our targets on “Lilyhammer” in terms of PR, viewing, and critical acclaim. The show has driven millions of hours viewed, is rated highly (4 out of 5 stars on average) and generated hundreds of millions of consumer impressions with a comparatively small PR and marketing spend. In the quarter, we announced another original premiering in 2013, “Hemlock Grove”, a one-hour 13 episode series from Eli Roth and Gaumont International TV based on Brian McGreevy’s gothic horror novel. As we build our capability in originals, we will have some advantages relative to our competitors. Namely, we have extensive user viewing history and ratings data to allow us to better understand potential appeal of future programs, as well as a very broad and already segmented audience. At the same time, we don’t face the same pressure as linear or ad-supported online networks to deliver ratings. Finally, we should be able to use our size and international scale to bring the best original and exclusive content from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. This is a real advantage over our regional competitors. Global Profitability: Q1 Results & Outlook Q1 net loss of ($5) million, and ($0.08) per share, was better than our expectations, predominantly driven by the outperformance in both domestic and international streaming contribution profit, in addition to slightly lower global Tech & Dev and G&A costs than anticipated. Looking forward to Q2, sequential growth in domestic streaming contribution profit will offset the decline in DVD contribution profit from Q1, while improvements in profitability in each of the international markets will reduce the international losses by approximately $11 million (based on the midpoint of guidance). As a result, we are forecasting a much earlier return to global profitability than anticipated on a Q2 net income / (loss) range of ($6) to $8 million. The improvement in the outlook is a result of continued member growth (both domestically and internationally), as well as increased efficiency of our content and marketing spending. As described above, looking past Q2 and our expected return to international expansion this year, we expect to invest the growing profits from our domestic business in additional global expansion in order to both position ourselves to be the first to scale in each of our international markets, as well as expedite reaching such global scale that will allow us to license global content rights economically. 9Free Cash Flow In Q1, despite our net loss of ($5) million, we generated positive FCF of $2 million. Significant sources of cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation, depreciation expense in excess of PP&E purchases, and accrued interest on our notes, which more than offset cash payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense) and cash payments for taxes relative to the P&L benefit for income taxes. In general, FCF and net income track each other reasonably closely with the primary exception of payments for original content. Originals will not materially impact free cash flow until the second half of this year and will ramp in 2013 as we add more original programs. We finished the quarter with $805 million in cash and equivalents. Business Outlook Q2 2012 Guidance Domestic Streaming: Total Subscriptions 23.6 m to 24.2 m Paid Subscriptions 22.3 m to 22.9 m Revenue $526 m to $534 m Contribution Profit $72 m to $84 m International Streaming Total Subscriptions 3.45 m to 4.0 m Paid Subscriptions 2.8 m to 3.25 m Revenue $60 m to $67 m Contribution Profit (Loss) ($98 m) to ($86 m) Domestic DVD: Total Subscriptions 8.95 m to 9.35 m Paid Subscriptions 8.9 m to 9.3 m Revenue $287 m to $294 m Contribution Profit $126 m to $138 m Consolidated Global: Net Income (Loss) ($6 m) to $8 m EPS ($0.10) to $0.14 10Summary We’ve built an early lead in the global race to build the world’s best Internet TV network. As we grow, we are trying to balance prudence and ambition while keeping a strong focus on member satisfaction. We work hard every day to make our service even better. Our rapid return to profitability, enabling further international expansion, is very gratifying.

IR Contact: PR Contact: Ellie Mertz Steve Swasey VP, Finance & Investor Relations VP, Corporate Communications 408 540-3977 408 540-3947 11Metrics evolution As stated in our January letter, we slightly updated our definition of membership starting with the Q1 membership guidance. Members who are on payment hold will no longer be counted as members, while members who cancel mid-period will be counted until their service ceases at their period end. We estimate the net effect of these changes was that we are reporting 200k fewer domestic streaming members than we would otherwise report in Q1. There is no effect on revenue from this change. Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities. However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

If Netflix is going to add 7 million domestic streaming net additions in 2012, and we added that many net adds in 2010, then it is natural, but incorrect, to think that the seasonal distribution of quarterly net adds should be the same in both years. But, in 2012, Netflix has a larger starting membership base than it did in 2010, and also has a higher gross adds, higher churn business for getting to those 7 million net additions. As the math below shows, if Netflix generates 7 million net adds in 2012 (same as 2010), it is inherent that there is much more seasonality in the 2012 quarterly net adds than in 2010, even though the seasonality of gross adds is unchanged. In the example below we’ve simplified and abstracted the numbers to illustrate the principles. In the first model we show the seasonality of 5,000 net additions on a base of 10,000, and in the second model we show the increased seasonality of 5,000 net additions on a base of 20,000. Both models have the same churn and same seasonality of gross adds; yet in the case of a smaller starting base (model #1 with 10,000 starting members), Q2 represents 14% of annual net adds, whereas with a larger member base (model #2 with 20,000 starting members), Q2 represents only 7% of annual net adds. Model #1: 5,000 Annual Net Adds on Model #2: 5,000 Annual Net Adds on 10,000 Starting Members 20,000 Starting Members Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Monthly Churn 5% Gross Additions Seasonality 25% 20% 25% 30% 25% 20% 25% 30% Starting Members 10,000 11,517 12,202 13,388 20,000 21,491 21,860 23,072 Gross Additions 3,549 2,839 3,549 4,259 5,283 4,227 5,283 6,340 Cancels (2,032) (2,153) (2,363) (2,647) (3,793) (3,858) (4,072) (4,412) Ending Members 11,517 12,202 13,388 15,000 21,491 21,860 23,072 25,000 Net Additions 1,517 686 1,186 1,612 1,491 369 1,212 1,928 Net Adds Seasonality 30% 14% 24% 32% 30% 7% 24% 39% The above table holds churn constant between the two models. But in 2012 we have higher churn and higher gross adds than in 2010. The increased seasonality of net adds is even more pronounced with these factored in. The table below has the same net adds (5,000) as the two models above, and the same seasonality of gross adds. But now we add higher churn and higher gross adds. You can see that getting to those 5,000 net adds implies that Q2 is only 2% of the annual net additions. 17Model #3: 5,000 Annual Net Adds on 20,000 Starting Members Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Monthly Churn 7% Gross Additions Seasonality 25% 20% 25% 30% Starting Members 20,000 21,571 21,657 22,880 Gross Additions 7,305 5,844 7,305 8,766 Cancels (5,734) (5,757) (6,082) (6,646) Ending Members 21,571 21,657 22,880 25,000 Net Additions 1,571 87 1,223 2,120 Net Adds Seasonality 31% 2% 24% 42% 18\"),\n",

       "  \"In Q2, we achieved financial performance in the top half of our guidance in nearly every metric, and have returned to profitability. 66 months ago, we launched Netflix streaming in the US with limited selection. Now, we have 24 million domestic streaming members and an incredible selection of TV shows and movies. Networks that license us prior season TV shows are in several cases benefiting from record audience numbers in the current season, partly due to the availability and promotion of prior seasons on Netflix. We are growing our business, and helping to grow the entire industry. 22 months ago, we launched our first international market: Canada. Since then we’ve grown to over 10% of Canadian households, made substantial increases in our content selection, and achieved enough scale to begin to generate contribution profits. 10 months ago, we launched Netflix in Latin America. Recently we surpassed one million members in the region and announced that one of the year’s biggest films, “The Hunger Games”, would debut on our service only five months after its theatrical release. With a population ten times the size of Canada, Latin America remains a huge opportunity for us. 6 months ago, we launched Netflix in the UK and Ireland, and today we are one million members strong. We believe we have pulled ahead of LOVEFiLM in every important streaming-related metric. Going forward, competing effectively with Sky is our core and substantial challenge. This growth in each of our markets reflects our investment in an easy-to-use personalized selection experience, ever more compelling content, and higher quality streaming delivery. Device by device, title by title, network by network, market by market, we are constantly improving our service. Q3 has begun strongly for us, and we expect to be profitable again in Q3. In Q4, we will launch our next international market, which will drive us temporarily back into the red. We have enormous challenges ahead, and no doubt will have further ups and downs as we pioneer Internet television. We are making progress in every market we serve, and see a once-in-a-generation opportunity ahead to build the world’s most popular TV show and movie service.

Roughly speaking, we would therefore expect our net adds to be about equal to 2010 in Q1 and Q3, lower in Q2, and higher in Q4, even given no change in the seasonality of gross adds. Q2 came in as we expected, which is about 50% fewer domestic net adds than in Q2 2010. For Q3 quarter-to-date, our domestic net additions are very nearly the same as Q3 2010 over the comparable partial period. In that quarter two years ago, we finished with 1.8 million domestic net additions. However, in the middle of that quarter, we launched Netflix on the iPhone to great reception, 2and we don’t have an equivalent launch this quarter. Moreover, this quarter the Olympics are likely to have a negative impact on Netflix viewing and sign-ups. So, our Q3 guidance is 1 million to 1.8 million domestic net adds. If we finish Q3 in the high end of that range, we would remain on track for 7 million domestic net additions for the year; otherwise it would be challenging to achieve that goal by year end. In either case, we are generating impressive growth this year in our most developed market. Our per-member viewing continues to rise on a year-over-year basis. As our service improves, members are choosing more often to enjoy Netflix. The more members enjoy Netflix, the longer they stay with us, and the more passionately they evangelize Netflix to their friends. Our reputation with our members and their likelihood to recommend the Netflix service is steadily improving. Our original thesis was three years to full brand recovery (subsequent to the DVD-related price increases last summer), and that seems correct so far. Our domestic streaming contribution margin improved 200+ basis points sequentially for the second consecutive quarter to 15.6% (up from 13.2% in Q1 and 10.9% in Q4), surpassing the year end contribution margin target we outlined back in Q4 2011. The Q2 margin expansion was predominantly driven by the planned sequential decline in marketing expense, while content expenses grew in line with revenue (as compared to Q1). For Q3, our guidance implies a further 100 bps expansion in contribution margin. Looking out beyond Q3, we will continue to target gradual margin expansion of about 100 bps per quarter, but any given quarter may see flatness sequentially as we accommodate lumpiness in content library additions and the seasonality of subscriber net adds. Domestic Content Every quarter, we add fresh film and TV titles and episodes to our domestic content library, and we continue to see good returns on these investments in the form of increased hours viewed by our members. Q2 domestic median hours viewed per member grew substantially year-over-year and total hours were at record levels. In the past, we have explained that the evolution of video streaming services to a large extent reflects the legacy of television networks: namely, a reliance on exclusive content as a differentiator. Consistent with this practice, we have increasingly licensed content on an exclusive basis, including titles such as “Mad Men”, “Breaking Bad” and “Gossip Girl”. This quarter we continued this practice, further differentiating our service through a multi-year exclusive agreement with Warner Bros. for complete previous seasons of hit shows “Pretty Little Liars” and “The Lying Game”. Exclusivity on the film side is also relevant, and we continue to pursue both exclusive and non-exclusive deals with our partners. There are many different kinds of exclusivity in this area. With EPIX, we currently have exclusivity for online distribution, but EPIX is increasingly distributed by MVPD and TV Everywhere. Our online exclusivity expires shortly, but our agreement to carry EPIX content non- exclusively runs through mid-2013. On the strength of Paramount’s and Lionsgate’s film slates in 2011 and 2012, EPIX has become a great product and we look forward to our ongoing relationship. 3We continue pursuing innovative deals with others. One such deal is an output arrangement with The Weinstein Company that will allow us to have an exclusive window for theatrical titles that will begin after the expiration of their first Pay window. This first-of-a-kind deal will give Netflix members access to all Weinstein theatrical films in what had traditionally been the first Free TV window -- just 12 months from the start of the Pay TV window, as opposed to the traditional holdback of nearly 8 years. Among the titles we will soon have are last year’s Academy Award winner, “The King’s Speech” and the highly acclaimed “Blue Valentine”. Next year we’ll get “My Week with Marilyn” and “The Iron Lady”. In the meantime, our current feature film offering is better than ever with the arrival of “Thor”, “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”, and “Immortals” which, together, generated more than $1.2 billion in domestic box office. In the coming months, we’ll see additional great titles including crowd pleasers like, “Captain America”, “Abduction”, “Super 8” and “Margin Call” along with critically acclaimed films like this year’s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, “The Artist”, plus “Albert Nobbs” and “Bernie”. Over time, we will have one of the best feature film offerings in the market as more than one third of the US box office generated year-to-date are from titles that will flow through our current deals including “The Hunger Games”, “The Avengers” and “The Lorax” from major studios and “Act of Valor”, “Mirror, Mirror” and “The Grey” from our mini-major partners. We have often said that our licensing of complete back seasons of on-air TV series is not only a great experience for Netflix members, but can help build the audience for new seasons of these series. Last quarter, the audience for season five of “Mad Men” swelled subsequent to prior seasons becoming available on Netflix. Last week, the fifth season of “Breaking Bad” debuted to record numbers, up 14% from last year’s premiere, no doubt buttressed by new viewers who were introduced to the series on Netflix. “Sons of Anarchy” on FX and “The Walking Dead” on AMC are additional examples of shows that have seen season over season viewership growth with the availability of the complete series on Netflix. Our unique ability to help members catch up at whatever point in the life of a series that suits them is just one way we add value to our partners when they license their content to Netflix. Domestic Competition As we’ve explained in the past, we compete for consumers’ viewing time with a variety of video services, including linear TV, DVRs, over-the-top (OTT) pure plays, and authenticated streaming offerings of the MVPDs and cable networks (TV Everywhere). We have yet to see HuluPlus or Amazon Prime Instant Video gain meaningful traction relative to our viewing hours, but as we continue to build a domestic profit stream they are likely to increase their efforts to gain viewing share. Redbox Instant by Verizon, once they launch, will face a big challenge to break into the top 3 of subscription streaming services. We believe our biggest long-term competition for viewing hours will come from MVPDs and cable networks, both directly and through their TV Everywhere offerings. MVPDs continue to improve their 4offering, and Comcast’s X1 interface, shown off at the recent cable show, is an impressive and leading example of this work. Our task is to keep raising the bar by operating on Internet pace, so that by the time Comcast broadly rolls out X1 over the coming years, we’ll be another generation ahead in member- pleasing experiences. As for HBO, they continue to do great work with HBO GO, which is now available to most US households that subscribe to the premium service. While we compete for content and viewing time with HBO, it is also possible we will find opportunities to work together – just as we do with other networks. Consumers who are passionate about movies and TV shows are quite willing to subscribe to multiple services. International Streaming We added nearly 0.6 million international streaming members in Q2, ending the quarter with 3.6 million international members. Compared to Q1, average paid subscribers increased 41% in the quarter as we continued to attract new members and convert free trials into paying subscribers. Our total international subscriber base came in slightly lower than our forecast in April as we implemented several up-front checks to validate consumer payment methods in Latin America. These changes reduced our free trials relative to the forecast, but had limited impact on paid subscriber numbers. Our international segment now represents 13% of total Netflix streaming members, and slightly over half of the streaming net additions in the quarter. UK and Ireland Following our successful launch in the UK and Ireland in Q1, we are encouraged by the continued strong growth of the service and today have one million members. This growth has been driven, in part, by our investments in content. Over the past quarter, we have added great movies to the service, including the critically acclaimed “Drive” and the family comedy “Zookeeper” in the Pay 1 TV window and recent blockbusters “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs”, “Transformers” and “Mission Impossible III”. We have also strengthened our TV offering. Over the past three months, we launched all six seasons of the hit series “Lost”, premiered the third season of the gritty drama “Breaking Bad”, and became the exclusive home in the UK and Ireland of the indie comedy series “Portlandia”. We will continue to expand and refresh our content offering in the coming quarter. Notable new titles will include the action-adventure film “Abduction”, the sentimental buddy comedy “50/50” and blockbusters “2012” and “Iron Man 2.” Through our recently announced deal with Twentieth Century Fox, we will be making available several top US TV series in Q3, including “Sons of Anarchy”, “The Killing” and the Emmy-winning “Modern Family”. Subscribers can also look forward to the next seasons of “Breaking Bad” and “Damages” exclusively on Netflix. As with all of our markets, our content additions are targeted to deliver incremental viewing, and therefore drive higher engagement and retention of our members. 5Looking past Q3, we feel our existing partnerships with local broadcasters and producers, US studios and networks, and independent partners will continue to provide us access to compelling content. For example, our upcoming Pay 1 feature films account for 16% of UK Box Office year-to-date, compared to an estimated 5% for LOVEFiLM’s streaming service. When we launched, we said Sky would be our primary competitor in the UK, and now we potentially face increased competition from Sky’s new OTT service “Now TV” at £15 per month, more than double our price. This is Sky’s first foray into a pure-play OTT streaming product and will likely be marketed aggressively. Our content libraries are mutually exclusive with no overlap of titles; as such, many households may subscribe to both services. Canada Our Canadian service continues to grow well – in both subscribers and hours viewed. Similar to trends in the US, Q2 median hours viewed per member were up year-over-year in Canada. We have movies in the first pay TV window from Paramount and Fox and our members are currently enjoying hit films like “Rise of the Planet of the Apes”, “Mr. Popper’s Penguins” and “Kung Fu Panda 2”. As in the US, the first four seasons of “Breaking Bad” and all six seasons of “Lost” are setting viewing records in Canada for us. We achieved a small contribution profit in Canada in Q2 and expect to remain profitable in this market going forward, as we manage our content and marketing expenses to grow more slowly than members and revenue. We intend to steadily increase our contribution margin in much the same way as we are doing for our US streaming business. Latin America In less than a year since expanding our service to Latin America, we are excited that we have more than one million members. At the same time, given the huge market opportunity, we remain focused on accelerating our growth by overcoming some of the many unique challenges in the region, namely, low device penetration, an under-developed Internet infrastructure and consumer payment challenges for ecommerce. We are making progress in the area of payments. We have modified our sign-up flow to improve free trial to paid subscriber conversion, and are in the process of expanding payment options in Mexico and Brazil. We are also closely tracking the performance of our content library to figure out the right formula for adding content that results in higher viewing and therefore greater member engagement, retention and positive word of mouth. We’re encouraged that the content additions we’ve made are having an impact. Our newest Mexican members are now watching more Netflix than their counterparts in the US, Canada, or the UK. 6Our content in the region keeps getting better. Global blockbuster “The Hunger Games” will debut on our service in August, only five months after its worldwide theatrical release and on the same date as it will be released on DVD and VOD in the region. Additionally, our new deal with FOX has given Latin American members access to hit shows such as, “Glee”, “How I Met Your Mother”, “24” and “Prison Break”. Additionally, we are adding episodes of “South Park” and other on-air TV Series, such as, “Revenge”, “Once upon a Time”, “Parenthood”, “Parks and Recreation” and “Franklin & Bash”. The fourth season of “Breaking Bad” debuts for us in Latin America in September. While challenges remain in the region, with subscribers and revenue growing, we are on-track to capture the big opportunity that the region represents. Next International Market Given our return to global profitability this quarter and our continued success in the UK, we announced last quarter that we’ve decided to open an additional attractive European market in Q4 of this year. We will have more to say about this market later in Q3. Total International Results & Outlook Total international revenue of $65 million in Q2 increased 50% sequentially driven by the overall growth in international members and the conversion of free trials to paid subscribers in both Latin America and the UK and Ireland. Total contribution loss of $89 million improved by $13 million compared to Q1, as subscriber revenue growth exceeded the growth of content expenses while marketing expenses declined post-UK launch. Looking forward to Q3, we are guiding to a small increase in the international loss relative to Q2. Similar to our experience in Canada last fall, the market opportunity we are experiencing in the UK is compelling enough that we intend to grow our content spend to expand the library and to drive additional growth in subscribers and viewing. Ultimately, our long-term goal in each market is to become the first streaming service to reach scale, allowing us to achieve profitability and to expand margins over the long-term. We expect to exceed 4 million total international members in Q3, with another half million net additions in the quarter (at the mid-point of guidance), consistent with Q2’s net additions. Our outlook assumes that viewing of the summer Olympics in July will dampen acquisitions across all of our markets. DVD DVD subscriptions declined this quarter to 9.2 million, in-line with our expectations. About 6.7 million of these 9.2 million also subscribe to our streaming service. The domestic DVD segment delivered $134 million of contribution profit in Q2, representing a 46% contribution margin, comparable to the Q1 7margin. Going forward, we believe DVD member declines will continue to moderate, while contribution margin will be roughly flat for the remainder of the year. The first round of USPS processing center reductions took effect in the first week of July. So far, we see minimal service related impact from these reductions. Original Programming Progress continues in the production of our previously announced original programs: “House of Cards” began filming in Baltimore in April, “Arrested Development” and “Orange Is the New Black” are in the writing phase, and principal photography has just begun on “Hemlock Grove”. We look forward to the debut of the entire first season of “House of Cards” in early 2013, and “Arrested Development” after that. Additionally, we expect to deliver a second season of “Lillyhammer” in 2013 and our original content team is working on expanding this lineup further. Product Improvement Our technology and development spending reflects our continued investments in improving the Netflix experience. In Q2, these investments produced improved Netflix players for both PC and Mac, as well as the continued expansion of our “Just for Kids” feature, already on PC, Mac, Wii, PS3 and Apple TV, and coming soon to the Xbox and iPad. In addition, we rolled out globally the much improved catalog sorting algorithms that we initially launched in Q1 in the US, and added incremental search capabilities (such as search by actor or director) to the PS3, with plans to roll-out this feature to other devices quickly. Given our size and growth, it now makes economic sense for Netflix to have its own content delivery network (CDN). As a result, we recently announced that we are enabling ISPs to get Netflix video data from Open Connect, a single-purpose Netflix CDN. We’ll continue to work with our commercial CDN partners for the next few years, but eventually our data will be largely served by Open Connect. Like commercial CDNs, Open Connect will provide the Netflix data at no cost to the locations the ISP desires, or ISPs can choose to get the Netflix data at common Internet exchanges. About 10% of Netflix data is already being served by Open Connect. Global Profitability: Q2 Results & Outlook We achieved our goal of returning to global profitability this quarter by posting $6 million of net income, and $0.11 EPS. Compared to Q1, margin expansion of the domestic streaming segment delivered an incremental $17 million of contribution profit, more than offsetting the $12 million decline of DVD contribution profit. Meanwhile, international losses moderated by $13 million and global operating expenses (Technology & Development and G & A) were flat relative to Q1. Our highly profitable US business, both streaming and DVD, is funding our international expansion. We believe this is the right long-term approach. In Q3, we expect to be profitable, while with the launch of a fourth international market in Q4, we will move to a consolidated loss. 8Free Cash Flow In Q2, positive free cash flow of $11 million was roughly equivalent to our consolidated net income of $6 million and improved quarter-over-quarter largely because of the sequential improvement in net income. Significant sources of cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation, depreciation expense in excess of PP&E purchases, and miscellaneous increases to accounts payable and accrued expenses, which more than offset cash payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense) and our bi-annual cash payment for interest on our notes. In general, free cash flow and net income track each other reasonably closely with the primary exception of payments for certain content deals (including original content and some output deals). We expect content payments to cause free cash flow to trail net income in Q3. The use of cash for originals will increase in Q4 and 2013 as we add more original programs. We finished the quarter with $813 million in cash and equivalents. New CMO - Kelly Bennett We were excited yesterday to announce the appointment of Kelly Bennett as our Chief Marketing Officer.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities. However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

For Q4, our guidance is for our U.S. membership base to increase to between 26.4 and 27.1 million, up more than 20% year over year from where we started the year at 21.7 million members. In Q3 we grew our contribution margin to 16.4%. For Q4, we are targeting 17%, an improvement of 60 basis points quarter over quarter and 600 basis points year over year from 10.9% last Q4. Membership satisfaction is very high, as seen in two key metrics: we increased our per member viewing in Q3 by more than 30% (year over year) to record highs by improving our content and member experience; and our voluntary churn is generally the lowest it has ever been.1 In contrast, involuntary churn has been increasing as we grow more mainstream and attract more lower-income households. Gross acquisitions continue to grow on a year over year basis. We also continue to see strength in repeat customers. While we are not growing membership as fast as in 2010, we think that over time nearly all U.S. households will be broadband households, nearly all video will be Internet video, and that as our content and member experience continue to improve faster than competitors, our long-term domestic market opportunity remains 2-3x that of linear HBO. Domestic Streaming Content Our members continue to enjoy TV shows from Netflix in huge numbers. About two thirds of our viewing is now episodic content, and about one third is movies. Both are important to us and our members. For on-demand movies, consumers today have many options at home, including $1.20 per night DVD from Redbox, DVR-recorded movies from premium and basic networks, DVD purchase and transactional on-demand offerings, like VOD or EST. In comparison, Netflix has better content discovery, is simpler to use, and is on all Internet screens. So our movie offering is substantially, but not amazingly, better than other movie options for consumers. 1 There are two components of churn/retention: “voluntary” which is members cancelling their service, and “involuntary” which is Netflix cancelling their service due to our inability to collect from their debit/credit card. For any set of members, churn declines over time as one would expect. Therefore, to detect trends, we look at churn/retention at various points in time across our members’ lifetimes, such as month 6 to month 7, for example. 2For serialized TV shows, however, we do offer an amazingly better experience, because our members can start right from the pilot episode of season one and watch multiple seasons at their own pace. Neither Redbox DVD nor the DVR truly offers this capability. Buying expensive boxed-set DVDs or even more expensive seasons of $2 episodes on VOD are the only other options for enjoying this “discover a show” behavior. Our high relative advantage in TV shows is part of why our viewing is now about two thirds TV shows. Of our top ten TV shows, six are only on Netflix, and not available on Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video, or HBO GO. The ratio is slightly higher for our top 50 TV shows. We have a very unique and compelling offering. While we were interested in keeping Epix movies exclusive to Netflix, we and Epix could not reach terms that made sense to both of us. We could better spend the incremental dollars on high profile TV titles. The movies from Epix constitute only about 5% of our viewing, and we continue to have them, on a non- exclusive basis. We will be a bidder for future fully exclusive studio output deals for movies as they become available. In general, to maintain a great service and low prices, we have to be choosy about what we are licensing for Netflix. Given the high volume of programming available on Netflix, titles come into and out of license nearly every day. Suppliers, of course, are incentivized to talk about how important their particular offering is to our service, and it can be concerning to investors to read stories of content non- renewal. We strive to offer our subscribers exceptional levels of high quality premium content choices. In order to do that, we have to make sure that relative to the cost of that content, we are making wise programming choices. Overall, Netflix now has a more engaging mix of movies and TV shows than it has ever had and continues to improve, as seen in our considerable growth in per member viewing. Our licensing teams are expert programmers informed by more than a decade of rich data on viewer preferences and viewing habits which allows them to license an overall mix of compelling content to uniquely please Netflix members. Our Netflix Originals are an integral part of our global content strategy, and we’ll go into more detail about them below. International Streaming We added nearly 0.7 million international streaming members in Q3, ending the quarter with 4.3 million international members. Net additions were at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting stronger than forecasted subscriber growth in each of our international markets. 3Nordics We launched our service in the Nordics (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) just last week, and have been very pleased by the positive reception. Since this is our fourth regional launch, we were able to apply what we’ve learned from our previous market launches to optimize the content programming library and marketing. In our first week of service, we attracted more free trial members than we did in our first week of service in Canada, so we are hopeful of a Canada-like success in the Nordics. Nordics members are not in our Q3 results, since the launch was in October. U.K. and Ireland As announced in August, we are currently over 1 million members strong in the U.K. and Ireland and continued to see strong growth in Q3. The U.K./Ireland market is expensive for content due to the competition with Sky and Amazon LOVEFiLM. We are very happy to be ahead of LOVEFiLM, and intend to continue to expand our content and grow our members rapidly. As we expected, the U.K./Ireland market will take materially longer than Canada to get to profitability, given the high level of competition and the continued expansion of our content. Latin America We have over 1 million members in Latin America, and there are over 50 million broadband households across these growing economies. Our service is working very well and voluntary churn is low in most of the region. We are growing rapidly, and we continue to add more content, especially in Brazil. Per-member viewing is up substantially from launch one year ago. We are outpacing all of our competitors. The biggest issue holding back much stronger growth is payments. For a variety of reasons, many Latin American broadband households are leery of, or unable to, provide debit/credit cards that can be accepted over the Internet. For those who do provide us debit/credit cards, we see higher rates of payment declines than in our other markets. Since these are households who are successfully paying for 4home broadband, we should be able to improve our effectiveness. We are working hard on all avenues to address these issues and accelerate our growth. In the long term, as ecommerce further develops in Latin America, these issues will lessen. It will take longer than we had planned to get to profitability in Latin America, but we are confident that this will be a very large and profitable market for us long term. Canada Canada continues to be a very strong market for us. Two years have passed since launch, and our subscriber growth is steady to slightly accelerating. Both retention and engagement are high among our Canadian members. We expanded our profitability in Canada in Q3 as revenue grew more quickly than content expense, and we intend to steadily expand our contribution margin over time, even as we continue to add more content. Total International Results & Outlook Total international contribution loss of $92 million was slightly higher than the $89 million loss in Q2, as we decided to capitalize on our strong U.K./Ireland momentum by investing additionally in our content library to drive more membership growth and more viewing. In Q4, as we launched the Nordics, we expect international contribution losses to increase to approximately $113 million (guidance midpoint) as we will have incremental content and marketing expenses but minimal revenue yet from this market. We intend this to be our peak quarter of international losses, and expect international losses will decline quarter by quarter next year. Once we’ve substantially reduced international losses, and with Netflix then being solidly profitable on a global basis, we will launch our next round of international expansion. Our aggressive investments today in international expansion have laid the foundation for building long- term profitable franchises in these markets, just as we have already done in Canada. Consumers around the world want Internet TV, and we are providing it for them in each of our markets. 5Streaming Competition With big markets comes competition. Since the transition from linear TV to Internet TV provides a staggeringly large long-term opportunity, it is not surprising that we are seeing more competitors vying for consumers’ time and money. One class of competitors are MVPDs and around the world they are getting better, offering on-demand services through DVRs, and TV Everywhere extensions like Xfinity.com. The prices charged by cable and satellite services are generally $50 to $100 per month, and we are a supplemental entertainment choice in comparison to these competitors. When we compare our viewing growth in those U.S. markets served by leading MVPDs offering TV Everywhere, versus the nation as a whole, we don’t see any difference. The implication is that even the best TV Everywhere isn’t yet an attractive alternative to Netflix viewing for Netflix members. Another class of competitors is other low-cost, globally-ambitious Internet subscription services. The big four are Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and HBO. We each have unique strategies to win share of consumers’ time and spending. Three of us are Internet firms with mostly licensed content, all getting into original content. One of us (HBO) is an original content firm getting into the Internet subscription business. It is possible that several of us of will be successful since some consumers will subscribe to multiple services, each of which has unique content. Hulu operates in Japan and the U.S. and is a joint venture owned by News Corp., Disney, and Comcast. While there are now around 2 million Hulu Plus members in the U.S., the ownership of Hulu makes it a wild-card in terms of future evolution as a global competitor. We believe in terms of U.S. viewing, Hulu is currently our closest U.S. competitor. Hulu is investing in producing original content. Hulu has commercial interruptions in their paid and free service, unlike Netflix, Amazon and HBO. Amazon is taking different strategies in the U.K. and the U.S. In the U.K., Amazon bought the LOVEFiLM DVD rental service early in 2011, presumably as a launch vehicle for streaming. For most of 2011, LOVEFiLM streaming was only available bundled with DVD rental and in late 2011, LOVEFiLM started offering a standalone streaming service. Netflix and Amazon LOVEFiLM now compete in the U.K. with similar price points. In the U.K., Amazon has Prime, but has not chosen to include streaming video as part of Prime. Our analysis of viewing and content says we are already modestly ahead in streaming viewing and content library, which we are very happy about given the large head-start LOVEFiLM had in the region. Our content is substantially distinct from LOVEFiLM’s content. We will keep investing in better content, and improving our member experience, which benefits from our global focus on streaming. In the U.S., Amazon is bundling streaming with its Prime shipping service, instead of with DVD rental. The majority of our most popular content is unavailable on Amazon Prime Instant Video, per the discussion above in the Domestic Streaming Content section. Our members tell us they’d like more 6content, not less, so we feel good about our relative content offering. Amazon is investing in original exclusive content as well. Our estimate is that viewing of Amazon Prime Instant Video has yet to pass that of Hulu. HBO is planning to launch a direct-to-consumer Internet subscription service in the Nordics, matching our low price point. This will be the first test of our relative strengths in stand-alone subscription video- on-demand. We think it will make strategic sense eventually for HBO to go direct-to-consumer in the U.S., and become more of a competitor to Netflix; so, that is our operating assumption, and we are looking forward to competing in the Nordics. Since many consumers in that eventuality would subscribe to both HBO and Netflix, we would compete like any two networks today. Our content is distinct from their content. Today we think the U.S. viewing of HBO GO by HBO’s approximately 29 million domestic subscribers has yet to equal overall viewing of Hulu or Amazon Prime. Finally, to be more complete in our assessment, we also compete for time with piracy, ad-supported streaming services, pay-per-view/VOD and linear programming. In most markets there are now local competitors, such as Sky’s Now TV in the U.K. and Viasat’s Viaplay in the Nordics. And there will surely be more who will try to build a compelling subscription streaming offering against Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and HBO. Against each of our competitors we have some mix of better exclusive content, better member experience, and a clearer brand identity. We are working to expand these advantages to win even more of those moments of truth when consumers decide on any given evening what service they turn to first when looking for entertainment. Despite this increasing competition, our per member viewing continues to rise. Original Programming Our goal is to produce unique and compelling serialized content for a cost comparable to similar licensed exclusive content, using these original series to strengthen our reputation and build deeper emotional ties to consumers. If we are as successful with originals as we think we will be in Q1, then the attention paid to Netflix will be positive and substantial, and we’ll have more people joining Netflix than we would otherwise. Our first streaming content type was movies. Then we added licensed prior-season television. This third category of content is first window premiere of exclusive serialized episodic television. We are now in full production of four original series to debut exclusively on Netflix in 2013, plus a second season of “Lilyhammer,” which debuted on Netflix last February. 7On February 1st, we’ll release in all of our markets the entire first season (13 episodes) of David Fincher’s “House of Cards” starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright. The first few episodes are nearly done and we are delighted with the results. Typically when one discovers a new show on linear TV they get the joy of watching a new episode only to have to wait a week or more to see the next one. We are releasing all the episodes at once because that is the better member experience that comes from Internet TV. Later in the spring we will be bringing Netflix members the long-awaited fourth season of “Arrested Development,” a show that has grown astonishingly in popularity in the six years it has been off-air and which now has a large global base of fans awaiting season four. Like our other originals, this will only be available on Netflix within our markets. After that comes “Hemlock Grove,” a horror thriller from scare king Eli Roth, starring Famke Janssen, Dougray Scott and Lili Taylor, then “Orange is the New Black,” a prison dramedy from “Weeds” creator Jenji Kohan starring Taylor Schilling and Jason Biggs, and lastly, season two of “Lilyhammer”. If you step back a decade, our first competence as a company was DVD-by-mail. Next, we figured out how to succeed in streaming of TV shows and movies. Then we started expanding internationally, one market at a time, learning as we grew. Like our global expansion, we will take our original programming expansion step by step, getting better along the way. Embarking on original series has implications from a cash flow standpoint. Our cash expense for originals is quite front loaded, compared to the P&L expense on these deals. We’ll often pay for the entire 5-10 year license all in the first few years. Q4 of this year will be the first quarter in which our originals start to become a material use of cash relative to the P&L. More on this topic below in the FCF section. Improving Streaming Member Experience Our better member experience is key to staying ahead of the competition, and increasing consumer engagement. When most companies grow, they see their engagement metrics drop, while we see the opposite, with hours viewed per member continuing to climb despite our already large scale. Crucial to driving hours viewed are the efforts of our product teams, who during the quarter launched several improvements to the Netflix experience. A key thing that sets Netflix apart is our algorithms for personalization, which help members find content they will enjoy, and lead to increased viewing for any given set of content. Compared to simplistic “most popular” merchandising, our algorithms add much enjoyment to our members’ experience. We continue to A/B test new algorithms, and our rate of learning is faster than any competitor because we have a larger membership from which to learn. 8On the visual side, this quarter we launched a new and improved UI for smart phones (both iPhone and Android), which allows for richer content browsing on devices. In addition, we launched our first multi- device experience: smartphones (both Android and iPhones) can now be used to control the Netflix TV experience via the PS3. As this interaction model becomes more common among our members, we’ll improve the experience to match the need, adding more functionality and expanding the device reach. To increase consumer engagement, we launched an improved post-play experience on the website and the PS3 (with other devices to follow soon), which makes it even easier to play subsequent episodes and offer relevant suggestions at the end of movies. As a sign of our achievements in the area of product development and the technical advancement of television, we were delighted to receive this month our first Emmy from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development. DVD DVD subscriptions declined this quarter to 8.6 million, at the better end of our guidance range. Over two-thirds of these DVD members also subscribe to our streaming service. We expect DVD subscriptions to continue their decline but we’re pleased the decline slowed in Q3. DVD is a great reference format, and we carry nearly every DVD ever published. We continue to see minimal service-related impacts from the first round of USPS processing center reductions that took effect in the first week of July. The domestic DVD segment delivered $131 million of contribution profit in Q3, representing a 48% contribution margin, higher than the 46% margin in Q1 and Q2 due to a lower rev share mix this quarter. We anticipate contribution margin will be up slightly in Q4, and then down sequentially from Q4 to Q1 as usage increases in Q1 and the expected USPS rate increases take effect in January. Global Profitability: Q3 Results & Q4 Outlook We remained profitable this quarter with $8 million of net income, and $0.13 EPS. Compared to Q2, net income was essentially flat, as increased domestic streaming contribution profit (up $8 million) more than offset a $3 million decline of DVD contribution profit, a $3 million increase in international losses, and a $2 million increase in global operating expenses. Our combined U.S. business remains strong. Excluding international contribution losses, we will generate over $400 million of operating income this year after covering global operating expenses. As expected, in Q4, we will likely move to a consolidated loss because of our initial launch investment in the Nordics. 9Free Cash Flow & Content Commitments In Q3, as expected, negative free cash flow of $20 million trailed net income of $8 million, and we ended the quarter with $798 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Significant uses of cash in the quarter (relative to net income) were cash payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense), cash payments for PP&E (including cache boxes for our Open Connect program), and reductions in miscellaneous accounts payable and accrued expenses. As we’ve highlighted, our movement into original programming will require more up-front cash payments than our typical content licensing agreements, beginning in Q4 and increasing in 2013. So, due to initial cash payments for originals, in addition to other cash payments for content in excess of P&L expense, we anticipate negative FCF for several quarters. We have enough cash on hand to fund our planned originals in addition to our ongoing expenses, maintain an adequate reserve, and then return to positive FCF. We believe the investment in originals is wise, and we will evaluate the performance of the slate next year to determine at what level we should fund additional originals. We have invested heavily over the past two years in building our global content library, and as a result, the corresponding contractual obligations have ramped significantly. While we are still adding new shows and movies to the service every quarter, and our engagement is growing, our content obligations have stabilized. In particular, our total streaming commitments at the end of Q3 were flat sequentially at $5.0 billion, with $2.1 billion due within the next 12 months. Of note, our content licenses and corresponding obligations are our major cost of revenues. And, as we point out each time we reference obligations, the $5.0 billion represents the known minimum obligation amounts, but does not include obligations that we cannot quantify but could be significant. 10Business Outlook Q4 2012 Guidance Domestic Streaming: Total Subscriptions 26.4 m to 27.1m Paid Subscriptions 24.9 m to 25.4 m Revenue $581 m to $588 m Contribution Profit $94 m to $102 m International Streaming Total Subscriptions 5.2 m to 5.9 m Paid Subscriptions 4.25 m to 4.75 m Revenue $90 m to $100 m Contribution Profit (Loss) ($119 m) to ($107 m) Domestic DVD: Total Subscriptions 7.85 m to 8.15 m Paid Subscriptions 7.7 m to 8.0 m Revenue $248 m to $255 m Contribution Profit $117 m to $129 m Consolidated Global: Net Income (Loss) ($13 m) to $2 m EPS ($0.23) to $0.04 Summary We believe Internet TV will grow for the next few decades, and that some firms will build extremely valuable businesses providing consumers an incredible, personalized Internet TV experience. Society has had over 50 years of linear TV dominance where channel owners decide what and when people can enjoy content. With Internet TV, consumers get power, control and convenience. They can decide what, when, and where they want to watch. They can pause and resume anytime. They can enjoy content on a broad range of amazing devices. Internet TV is the future of television, and we are leading the change. 11Sincerely, Reed Hastings, CEO David Wells, CFO Conference Call Q&A Session Netflix management will host a webcast Q&A session at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time today to answer investor questions not addressed in this letter.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       "  \"Q4 capped a tremendous year for Netflix as Internet TV becomes an ever-growing part of people’s lives:  we added nearly 10 million global streaming members in 2012,  we grew to over 33 million global streaming members,  we generated profits for the year 2012, despite large international investments establishing Netflix in 40 countries around the world, and  we developed several major original series, which debut this year.

Our holiday season was particularly strong, driven by consumers buying new electronic devices, including tablets and smart TVs. Both voluntary and involuntary retention improved in Q4. The increase in involuntary retention was due to improvements in how we process payments and recover those members on payment hold. We believe the gains in voluntary retention stemmed from steady improvements in service and content relative to the broad array of video choices available to consumers, as shown by the continued growth in our median hours viewed per member. Contribution margin continued to climb in Q4, expanding sequentially 210 basis points to 18.5%. Our outperformance relative to our target of 100 basis points of margin expansion per quarter was driven by higher than forecasted members and revenue and lower than forecasted content delivery costs. Starting this quarter, you’ll see that we expanded our segment disclosures to break out marketing and cost of revenues. We’ve been investing in making our service better with increased spending on content, which helps both retain and attract members, and have been able to trim marketing spending yet maintain strong net additions. Our target remains to expand contribution margin on average about 100 basis points per quarter. We anticipate domestic streaming contribution profit will, for the first time ever, be larger than DVD contribution profit (and up about 90% year over year) in Q1. Regarding domestic streaming content, we announced in Q4 that we will be the exclusive “Pay 1” home for theatrical releases from the Walt Disney Studio starting in 2016. While we’ve done similar major studio Pay 1 deals before (e.g. Paramount in Canada, Warner Bros. in the Nordics, and Lionsgate in the U.K. and Ireland), and will do more in the future, the Disney deal is particularly significant because it is our first Pay 1 deal with a major studio in the U.S. and because of the strength of the Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm titles. 2016 is a long way off, and in the meantime, we are adding lots of other great films and TV shows, including a wide assortment of family films from the Disney catalog. More recently, we signed a deal with Warner Bros., the largest TV producer in the world, bringing exclusively to Netflix complete previous seasons of popular on-air serialized dramas such as “Revolution” on NBC and “The Following” on Fox. This deal is significant because we are licensing directly from the producer, rather than the networks on which these shows air, allowing us to bring previous seasons to Netflix earlier than traditional network deals have accommodated. This type of license agreement plays right to our sweet spot. When it comes to highly serialized TV series, Netflix 2offers an amazingly better experience than any other alternative as members can start right from season one, episode one and watch episodes how and when they feel like it. In terms of domestic competition, TV Everywhere, including HBO GO, continues to improve, and linear TV distributors clearly see the benefit of offering Internet TV. This competition for viewing time will increase over the next several years, as we have long predicted, as consumers come to expect Internet TV on demand viewing for all their video entertainment. More narrowly, Amazon Prime, Redbox Instant, and Hulu also offer low-cost streaming offerings, and they have some of the same content that Netflix has, as well as some unique content. The more unique content they have (for example, “Battleground” and “Community” on Hulu, or “Falling Skies” and “The Closer” on Amazon Prime), the more they are a different service than ours. To the degree they have some of the same content as Netflix, they are potentially a substitute for Netflix. To examine this, we looked at the top 200 titles on Netflix: our 100 most popular movies and our 100 most popular TV shows in Q4. Of these 200, 113 are not on Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus or Redbox Instant. Of the 87 that are available on at least one of these services, Hulu Plus offers 27 of the 200; Amazon Prime 73 of the 200; and Redbox Instant 12 of the 200, with significant overlap in TV between Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime, and in movies between Amazon Prime and Redbox Instant. In other words, when it comes to the most popular content with members on Netflix, none of these services are good substitutes to Netflix. 3Like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu are moving towards increasing exclusives and original series, and over time as a group we are likely to compete more like Showtime and HBO do today. In the U.K. this is already the case: Sky NOW TV, LOVEFiLM, and Netflix have very limited overlapping content. The same holds true in the Nordics among the various services. In such a world, our originals will be a great asset. When it comes to competition, we not only have a superior content offering due to our larger budget, but we are further along the experience curve when it comes to improving our user interface and delivering great quality streaming. For all of these reasons, Netflix continues to add members rapidly. Earlier this year, the Video Privacy Protection Act, or VPPA, was modernized and now allows U.S. members to share what they are watching on Netflix with their friends on an ongoing basis. Our members will now be able to choose to have “friends rows” within the Netflix user interface for friends they have agreed to share viewing with. Our default settings will not auto-post to Facebook timeline, but members will be able to post to Facebook specific titles they are passionate about. We are excited to roll these features out in the U.S. in the next few months. Looking forward, we expect this year’s Q1 net additions to be slightly higher than last year’s Q1 net additions of 1.7 million. The fact that our growth remains this strong despite intensifying competition, and our already substantial U.S. market penetration, underlines the large opportunity ahead. As a reminder, we detailed in our April 2012 Investor Letter how unchanged seasonality of gross adds would, due to the larger size of our existing subscriber base, result in increased seasonality of net additions. Thus we would expect fewer net additions in Q2 2013 than in Q2 2012, because Q2 is our seasonally lightest quarter. That said, we anticipate the fourth season of “Arrested Development” to debut in Q2, and that could bring us higher than otherwise expected membership. International During the quarter, we grew to over 6 million international members, as people around the world discover the benefits of Netflix. Our total international contribution loss of $105 million in Q4 was, as expected, higher than the prior quarter international loss of $92 million, owing to the incremental costs associated with our launch in the Nordic countries. The Q4 loss was lower, however, than our guidance midpoint of a $113 million loss, due primarily to the higher than expected growth of international subscriptions and revenue. Over the course of this year, we expect to see declining losses in our current international markets as member growth exceeds growth in content spending. With a Q1 guidance midpoint of $87 million in international losses, we expect a sequential improvement of $18 million, with more modest sequential improvements expected in subsequent quarters. 4For the first half of 2013, we aren’t planning to launch additional international markets. We are evaluating several expansion markets for late 2013 or 2014, but have not made any decisions yet. Our launch in the Nordics was very successful, confirming our belief in the large international opportunity for our service. In Latin America, we’ve made steady progress on our consumer payment infrastructure. In Brazil, we’ve recently launched a direct debit consumer payment option with several major banks (“Débito Automático”) and are testing the uniquely Brazilian form of payments known as Boleto Bancário. In Mexico, we’ve made progress in enabling debit cards for Netflix which has to be done in some cases bank-by-bank. Over 50 million households pay for residential broadband in Latin America, over half the U.S. number, so this region is a massive opportunity for us. In Q4, the 2012 hit film “The Hunger Games” debuted on our Canadian service, with much success, just as it had a few months prior on our Latin America service. In Q1, it will debut on our U.K. and Ireland services, followed by the U.S. The multi-territorial success of “The Hunger Games” on Netflix shows the value that an international programming platform like Netflix offers content brands, and underlines how such broad international reach remains unique. In addition to competition from local broadcasters and distributors with TV Everywhere-type products, and from piracy, we face many pure-play competitors around the world, including Clarovideo, Sky NOW TV, HBO Nordics, Amazon LOVEFiLM, Viaplay, and others. Our estimates from Internet data flows and other sources suggest we lead all of them in both viewing and revenue. We have a large and growing membership base to invest against, and our R&D effort is more substantial than our competitors, allowing us to provide a better and faster-evolving user experience that gives members the ability to find great series and films to watch, no matter the territory. Given this heightened competition, we’ll say a little less about country by country results than in the past, to avoid inadvertently helping our competitors. Long-term international success for Netflix is consumer adoption and contribution margins at the levels of our domestic market. Progress towards that can be seen quarterly in our growing international membership and declining international losses. Original Series We believe that February 1st will be a defining moment in the development of Internet TV. On that day, we will release all 13 episodes of “House of Cards” in all of our markets, allowing our members the freedom to immerse themselves when and how they want in the world created by David Fincher and his stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright. 5Imagine if books were always released one chapter per week, and were only briefly available to read at 8pm on Thursday. And then someone flipped a switch, suddenly allowing people to enjoy an entire book, all at their own pace. That is the change we are bringing about. That is the future of television. That is Internet TV. Stepping back, we have three major types of streaming content on Netflix: 1. Movies from one to fifty years old 2. Prior seasons of current TV shows and complete prior season of off-air TV shows 3. Original series only available on Netflix. The first category, movies, is where we started. Then, over the last few years, we’ve greatly expanded our offering in the second category, prior-season TV, with a particular emphasis on serialized drama. Such shows were struggling to find a consistent economic return on linear TV, whereas for us they work great, playing directly into the way that people actually prefer to watch such shows. Original series are a third type of content to attract and retain members. Because original series can be completely exclusive to Netflix (no TVOD, no linear, no kiosks, no theaters) we believe they will be more effective in attracting and retaining members than equivalent content that is less exclusive to Netflix. We believe original series developed for Internet TV will be better for creators, better for consumers, and better for Netflix. A large on-demand service has fundamental advantages in producing and launching new series. Linear channels must aggregate a large audience at a given time of day and hope the show programmed will actually attract enough viewers despite this constraint. With Netflix, members can enjoy a show anytime, and over time, we can effectively put the right show in front of members based on their viewing habits. Thus we can spend less on marketing while generating higher viewership. For linear TV, the fixed number of prime-time slots mean that only shows that hit it big and fast survive, thus requiring an extensive and expensive pilot system to keep on deck potential replacement shows. In contrast, Internet TV is an environment where smaller or quirkier shows can prosper because they can find a big enough audience over time. In baseball terms, linear TV only scores with home runs. We score with home runs too, but also with singles, doubles and triples. Because of our unique strengths, we can commit to producing and publishing “books” rather than “chapters”, so the creators can concentrate on multi-episode story arcs, rather than pilots. Creators can work on episode 11 confident that viewers have recently enjoyed episodes 1 to 10. Creators can develop episodes that are not all exactly 22 or 44 minutes in length. The constraints of the linear TV grid will fall, one by one. 6For viewers, Internet TV is a better experience because of the freedom and flexibility it provides, and in the case of Netflix, the lack of commercials. In addition, by releasing our shows on the same day across all of our markets, we will delight international members, as usually, they have to wait months after a U.S. premiere to enjoy the same content. “House of Cards” will be followed by Eli Roth’s “Hemlock Grove” (a horror thriller) on April 19th, the much anticipated fourth season of “Arrested Development” in May, “Orange is the New Black” (a prison dramedy from “Weeds” creator Jenji Kohan), “Derek” with Ricky Gervais, and lastly this year, season two of “Lilyhammer.” If we are successful with our originals, we will produce content with comparable cost per viewing hour to other exclusive premium content. Success with originals will also enhance the global reputation of Netflix as a source of unique must-view content. While our first slate of originals will represent a small percentage of both our content budget (i.e. P&L expense) and total viewing hours this year, the cash is front loaded relative to the P&L expense. In Q4, our current originals became a material use of cash for the first time. They are expected to consume more cash in Q1 and then decrease in terms of cash use in Q2 forward. More on this topic below in the FCF section. Programming Great Content Our content budget has grown rapidly over the last few years, allowing us to greatly expand the scope of the Netflix offering. With every title we add to the library, we remain focused on our goal of being an expert programmer, licensing an overall mix of content that delights our members, rather than trying to be a very broad content distributor. A distributor aggregates and provides access to wide swaths of content, but usually on a non-exclusive and undifferentiated basis. Comcast and DIRECTV are distributors. A programmer takes an active role in creating a curated content offering, providing selective and often exclusive content that is differentiated from other programmers. HBO and Netflix are programmers. As a programmer, we seek to offer our members high quality and high engagement premium content choices. To do so, we have increasingly licensed content on an exclusive basis to ensure our members are receiving an entertainment experience that cannot be replicated by our competitors. Coincidently, this means we are selective about what titles we add to the service and what content agreements we renew. Since we can’t license everything and also maintain low prices, we seek out content that delivers the highest member engagement relative to its cost. This also means that we’ll 7forego or not renew content that doesn’t optimize for engagement and cost efficiency across the available content choices within the constraints of our budget. This was the case when we did not renew our Starz agreement in 2011, as well as our A&E / History Channel agreement last year. In all cases, we use our extensive member viewing data to inform our programming choices to create a unique and compelling offering that will most delight our members. As part of our selective programming strategy, we focus not only on major studio output, but also on providing our members with interesting and compelling independent content. Because of our merchandising capabilities as well as our massive member base, we enjoy high engagement on what would otherwise be considered non-mainstream content. For example, we currently stream three of the 2013 Oscar nominated documentary feature films on Netflix: “5 Broken Cameras,” “The Invisible War,” and “How To Survive a Plague.” In addition, many of the top independent films of the year can only be found on Netflix. Improving Member Streaming Experience We are focused on creating an experience that delights our members and increases their engagement. Our large member base allows us to do more and bigger experiments, which enables us to learn what works best for our members more quickly than our competitors. We recently launched Netflix on Windows 8 with a great user interface that works for both mouse/keyboard and touch screen, and we launched Netflix on the Wii U with a second screen experience for choosing what to watch. We are also pioneering the use of tablets and handsets as second-screen choosing devices for TV viewing. As part of the Netflix search experience, we have made it even easier for members to explore our vast catalog and we'll continue working on improving the algorithms that power our recommendations, as well as making search more effective for our members. Another way we’re now leveraging our recommendations system is to identify the audience most likely to enjoy each Netflix Original from our diverse upcoming slate. Unlike linear television that needs to build an audience for the premiere showing, our tools are designed to maximize the value of each show over the long term. We’ll learn the characteristics of the members who love each show and promote to potential viewers with similar traits. To make our suggestions more useful, we have recently started testing several variations of a personal profiles feature that creates suggestions for different members of the household based on their own taste, not confused by the viewing of their kids or others sharing the same subscription. If this test succeeds in increasing member engagement, we will roll out profiles more broadly later this year. Last year, Netflix launched Open Connect to enable ISPs to receive Netflix media data directly, and for free, at various standard interconnection points or within their own networks. This is more efficient 8than going through intermediaries, and provides consumers with the highest quality picture and least rebuffering. Most international ISPs and many domestic ISPs already receive their traffic via Open Connect. Our newest and best video formats (Super-HD and 3D) that are larger and more challenging to deliver are only available on Open Connect. We are working hard to get all ISPs to directly connect for free to Open Connect to improve their customers’ broadband experience. DVD DVD memberships declined less than we had anticipated this quarter to 8.2 million (above the top end of our guidance range), driven by stronger than forecasted retention. The decline has slowed in each quarter since we introduced the DVD-only plan. The domestic DVD segment delivered $128 million of contribution profit in Q4, representing a 50% contribution margin, higher than anticipated due to higher members and lower than expected DVD usage. We anticipate a decline in DVD contribution margin sequentially from Q4 to Q1 as usage seasonally increases in Q1 and the expected USPS rate increase of $0.01 each way takes effect in January. The US Postal Service is under financial stress, but we don’t foresee service changes this year that have a material negative impact upon us or our members. Global Profitability: Q4 Results & Q1 Outlook Consolidated Q4 net income of $8 million ($0.13 EPS) exceeded our guidance due to contribution profit out-performance primarily in our domestic and international streaming segments. Net income was flat quarter over quarter, as increased domestic streaming contribution profit (up $18 million) more than offset a $3 million decline of DVD contribution profit, and a $12 million increase in international losses (driven by the launch of the Nordics market), while global operating expenses were flat sequentially. We anticipate net income will be relatively flat quarter over quarter in Q1, as improvements in both domestic and international streaming profits will be offset by a decline in DVD contribution profit and increases in global operating expenses. Free Cash Flow & Capital In Q4, the gap between free cash flow (negative $51 million) and net income (positive $8 million) widened as a result of payments for the original programs coming to Netflix in 2013. Significant uses of cash in the quarter (relative to net income) were cash payments for both originals and non-originals 9content (in excess of the P&L expense), cash payments for PP&E (related to the continued rollout of our Open Connect servers), and tax payments. In the past, we have managed our content licensing agreements such that cash payments in any quarter do not exceed 110% of the P&L expense (in other words, if our P&L expense was $200 million in the quarter, our cash payments for content would not exceed $220 million in the quarter). As we shared on our last earnings call, our original programming will require more up-front cash payments than most other content licensing agreements, raising this ratio (of cash to P&L for content) to as high as 120% in certain quarters with material originals payments. The bulk of our remaining cash payments for our current originals will be in Q1, driving FCF materially more negative than Q4, and then FCF will improve substantially in subsequent quarters. As highlighted previously, we have sufficient cash on hand to fund our current slate of originals and ongoing expenses, and to maintain an adequate reserve, before returning to positive FCF. In addition, we are exploring taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment to refinance our $200 million in outstanding notes and raise additional cash through new debt financing. This would give us additional reserves as well as increased flexibility to fund future originals. Miscellaneous For management purposes, we look at the relatively modest overhead expenses (mostly personnel) in our global content acquisition group as part of G&A, and as such we don’t allocate them across our three business segments. For our global marketing team, however, the also relatively modest overhead costs were historically allocated entirely to just the domestic streaming segment. Starting in Q1, marketing overhead will be part of G&A, consistent with how we treat content overhead, and will not be allocated to the domestic streaming segment. This is about $5 million of expense in Q1, so the change will slightly increase domestic streaming contribution profit, and slightly increase global operating expense by the same amount. There is no change to operating income, net income, cash flows, or any other global metric. Starting in July, Reed has some 10-year employee options expiring every month, and he plans to sell upon forced-exercise. He has no other sales planned. Carl Icahn became a 10% investor last quarter at approximately $58 per share. We have no further news about his intentions, but have had constructive conversations with him about building a more valuable company. 10Business Outlook Q1 2013 Guidance Domestic Streaming: Total Subscriptions 28.5 m to 29.2 m Paid Subscriptions 27.2 m to 27.9 m Revenue $633 m to $641 m Contribution Profit $122 m to $130 m International Streaming Total Subscriptions 6.6 m to 7.3 m Paid Subscriptions 5.8 m to 6.4 m Revenue $132 m to $144 m Contribution Profit (Loss) ($94 m) to ($80 m) Domestic DVD: Total Subscriptions 7.6 m to 8.05 m Paid Subscriptions 7.45 m to 7.85 m Revenue $239 m to $246 m Contribution Profit $101 m to $112 m Consolidated Global: Net Income (Loss) $0 m to $14 m EPS $0.00 to $0.23 Summary Netflix offers consumers what they want -- compelling content and control over how and when they watch it.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding contribution margin; future content deals, rollout of social sharing features, competition, impact and value of our original content, business outlook in our international markets; expansion to additional international markets; our content programming strategy, improvements to our member experience, business outlook for our DVD segment; free cash 12flow and usage of cash; member growth, including total and paid; revenue, and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of 2013. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; the continued availability of content on terms and conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition and widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 10, 2012.

We added over 2 million members to the service, launched to great reception our first Original series of 2013 House of Cards, and improved our streaming contribution margin above our 100 bps target. We added 2.03 million members compared to 2.05 million in the prior quarter and 1.74 million in Q1 a year ago. In terms of comparing our Q1 net additions to last year’s performance, it’s worth reminding everyone of the change we made to our member definition as detailed in the January 2012 Investor letter in which we immediately excluded from our member count those members who are on payment hold. This more conservative definition translated into ~300,000 fewer net additions in Q1 2012, so we would have reported about 2 million. Therefore, think of Q1 2013 net adds as roughly comparable to the year ago period, a positive outcome. For many years, as a DVD-based business, Q1 net additions have been larger than the prior quarter net adds, but not this Q1. For DVD, factors such as a robust holiday DVD release slate and publicity for new movies created by the awards season telecasts likely influenced this pattern, boosting Q1 relative to Q4. This Q4 to Q1 pattern appears to be different for our streaming business, and this is our first clean streaming holiday season to show the seasonality. We’ve seen improvements in our business over the last year in content, in our product, in optimizing the way we process payments, and in the general recovery of our brand. All of these improvements contribute to higher member satisfaction, which we see in higher year-over-year levels for members’ likelihood to recommend our service. During the quarter, we continued to grow members and revenue faster than content spending and our domestic streaming contribution margin increased to 20.6% in Q1, a further 140 bps of improvement from Q4 (not including 70 bps resulting from reclassifying marketing overhead)1. On a year-over-year basis, we expanded contribution margin over 600 bps on essentially flat marketing expense. Our target remains to expand contribution margin on average about 100 bps per quarter. We introduced our streaming only plan at $7.99 in 2010. We’ve been adding more content to the service ever since, and are very happy with membership growth at this low price point. In terms of significant U.S. licensing deals, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros. TV group for selected complete previous seasons of popular shows from Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation and Adult Swim, as well as the TNT serialized drama Dallas. We also reached agreement directly with Warner Bros. TV to bring to Netflix members earlier, and more 1 As previewed in our January 2013 Investor letter, starting this quarter, marketing overhead is now part of global G&A (consistent with how we treat content overhead) and is not allocated to the domestic streaming segment. 2exclusively than ever before, complete previous seasons of some of the hottest shows on network and cable TV -- including Revolution (NBC), The Following (Fox), Longmire (A&E), and Political Animals (USA). The deal with Warner Bros. Television is significant because it illustrates our evolution to a curator of select programming. Many of our earliest deals were with networks and cable channels and included some shows that have not proven successful. Those networks and channels are also uniquely leveraged by their cable and satellite partners to hold back for as long as possible the availability of shows while limiting the kind of on-demand exclusivity we favor. By dealing directly with the producers of TV shows, we are better positioned to pick just those shows that we believe will work best and secure rights that may be otherwise blocked by TV carriage and transmission deals. In that same spirit, we’re also thrilled with our unique arrangement with Fox Television Studios to bring a third season of the fan favorite The Killing exclusively to our U.S., Canadian and Latin American members 90 days after the season finale airs on AMC. In the U.K., Ireland and Nordic countries, new episodes will premiere weekly and exclusively on Netflix, just days after the U.S. broadcast. As we continue to focus on exclusive and curated content, our willingness to pay for non-exclusive, bulk content deals declines. At the end of May we’ll be allowing our broad Viacom Networks deal for Nickelodeon, BET, and MTV content to expire. We are in discussions with them about licensing particular shows but have yet to conclude a deal. We continue to do lots of other business with Viacom around the world, such as our exclusive Pay1 deal for Paramount titles in Canada. With all the recently added fresh programming from Disney, Cartoon Network, Hasbro’s The Hub and Dreamworks Animation, we have a great kids offering. As we discussed a quarter ago and in our April 2012 Investor letter appendix, we generally expect Q2 net additions to be lower than prior year Q2 due to increased seasonality of net additions. This coming Q2, however, we have Arrested Development, and momentum from lots of new content coming to the service, so we expect to see slightly higher net additions than Q2 a year ago. Last quarter we shared with you that of our “top 200” titles, Amazon Prime Instant Video had only 73. This quarter it was 74. International Our international membership grew by 1 million during the quarter to a total of 7.1 million, generating 14% of global revenue. During Q4 2012, we added 1.8 million net international members and 1.2 million 3during Q1 20122. The Nordics and the UK/Ireland launch in Q4’12 and Q1’12, respectively, resulted in an elevated level of net additions in those launch quarters as we benefited from the initial growth of a new territory. In all of our markets, we saw growth and improved profits or reduced losses. International contribution losses improved $28 million sequentially, better than expected due primarily to less growth in content spending than forecast. For Q2, we are not forecasting a substantial improvement in contribution losses because we are increasing our international content spending in line with revenue growth. In early Q2, we implemented a modest price increase (15 BRL to 17 BRL) in Brazil, approximately matching local inflation over the last two years. We plan to launch an additional European market during the second half of 2013. We’ll have more to say about this on our July earnings call. Original Series On February 1, we premiered all 13 episodes of House of Cards to enormous popular and critical acclaim. The global viewing and high level of engagement with the show increased our confidence in our ability to pick shows Netflix members will embrace and to pick partners skilled at delivering a great series. The high level of viewer satisfaction implies we are able to target the right audience without the benefit of existing broadcast or cable viewing data and the strong viewing across all our markets gives us faith in our ability to create global content brands in a cost-effective, efficient way. Our decision to launch all episodes at once created enormous media and social buzz, reinforcing our brand attribute of giving consumers complete control over how and when they enjoy their entertainment. Some investors worried that the House of Cards fans would take advantage of our free trial, watch the show, and then cancel. However, there was very little free-trial gaming - less than 8,000 people did this - out of millions of free trials in the quarter. On April 19, we launched all 13 episodes of Hemlock Grove, a horror thriller from Eli Roth and we’re very pleased with its early performance. Hemlock Grove was viewed by more members globally in its first weekend than was House of Cards and has been a particular hit among young adults. Up next is the long-awaited and much-anticipated fourth season of comedy cult favorite Arrested Development, with all 15 episodes available on May 26. 2 The effect from the change to our member definition as discussed in the domestic streaming segment was very small for international (23,000 fewer Q1 2012 international net additions) because we had already excluded members on payment holds in LATAM. 4This summer, we’ll launch Orange Is the New Black, a prison dramedy from Weeds creator Jenji Kohan; Derek, a heartfelt, funny look at life in a senior center from Ricky Gervais; and, later in the year, season two of Lilyhammer. During the quarter, we announced two new Original series coming to Netflix. Turbo: F.A.S.T. (Fast Action Stunt Team), is a collaboration with DreamWorks Animation and our first ever series for kids. It will continue the story of the summer DreamWorks Animation movie Turbo when it premieres on our service in December. Coming to Netflix in late 2014, will be Sense8, a new Sci-Fi thriller from the Wachowski siblings, who created the Matrix Trilogy and Cloud Atlas, and J. Michael Straszynski, creator of the hit TV series Babylon 5. As we’ve said before, our first slate of Originals will represent a small percentage of both our content budget (i.e. P&L expense) and total viewing hours this year, though cash use is front loaded relative to the P&L expense. Long term, we believe the value of our Original series in driving acquisition and retention improvements will be borne out as we add more seasons of already popular shows like House of Cards and further series. Harry Potter was not a phenomenon in book one, compared to later books in the series. Marketing With the broader acceptance of streaming and Internet Television, more of our marketing now focuses on the content we bring to members. The launch of House of Cards provided a halo effect on our entire service and spoke to the quality of experience members can expect from Netflix. In addition to our emphasis on Original series, we are delivering targeted messages as high-profile titles arrive on the service. This marketing strategy is designed to attract new members, excite current members to watch more, and encourage past members to come back. Our media spend is increasingly digital, with a moderate reduction in our use of linear TV advertising. We have seen encouraging results from online video ads and we will continue to find new ways to reach consumers at key stages along their consumer journey from initial awareness to free trial. 5Improving Member Streaming Experience We continue to make the member experience better through AB testing, measuring the impact of our innovation on acquisition, retention, and hours of viewing. During the quarter, we continued to explore new payment vehicles with a focus on Latin America, adding direct debit with a number of banks in the region. Adding direct debit has lowered one of the barriers to membership in the region and is an example of how we generally expand the acquisition funnel, a focal point for our teams. We had a number of wins during the quarter with new algorithmic techniques to match members with content they’ll enjoy, driving more Netflix watching. The launch of House of Cards allowed us to explore new ways to promote significant individual titles to those members who are most inclined to watch without over-promoting to members with different tastes and are pleased with the results. In many households, Netflix is used by different family members, and we tested a “Profiles” feature that separates the activity of each individual. This enables us to offer more relevant personalized suggestions for each individual, and we expect to roll out profiles globally in the coming months. In January, the Video Privacy Protection Act was updated, allowing us to launch social features in the U.S, that we’ve been testing in the rest of the world since late 2011. We expect to see more social discovery of content to watch, supplementing the existing taste-based techniques we have relied upon to date. We’ll continue to test and innovate around social features. We also released the next major version of our Netflix player technology to our consumer electronics partners to include in their Smart TVs and set-top boxes. The new platform emphasizes size and performance improvements, and offers dramatically faster playback startup (aiming to match the time required for a linear channel change). This new platform will appear in a few new devices in time for the holiday season, and will roll out more widely in the spring 2014 refresh for many CE manufacturers. We continue to realize gains (in availability, scalability, and cost savings) from our push to migrate our technology to the cloud, and we recently launched the Netflix Cloud Prize as a way to accelerate evolution of the Netflix Open Source platform. In addition, we are developing and sharing standards, such as HTML5 video standards and encoding format standards, and we are actively working with our studio suppliers to create a more robust supply chain for delivery of content. A few members with large families run into our 2-simultaneous-stream limit. To best serve these members, we’re shortly adding a 4-stream plan, at $11.99 in the U.S., and we expect fewer than 1% of members to take it. 6DVD DVD memberships declined modestly to about 8 million. Combined with lower than expected content costs, higher revenue drove a better-than-expected $113 million contribution profit in Q1, representing a 46.6% contribution margin. The expected sequential decline in DVD contribution margin was due to seasonally higher usage in Q1 and the USPS rate increase of $0.01 each way that took effect in January. Absent USPS rate increases, we’ve been able to maintain our DVD contribution margin as members and shipment volume decline. We anticipate continuing to be able to maintain the margins we see in the first half of 2013 throughout the full year. Consistent with our view last quarter, we don’t foresee USPS service changes that will have a material negative impact upon us or our members for the remainder of 2013. Going forward we’ll continue to provide our full DVD segment level reporting but will only provide guidance on DVD contribution profit since that is what we focus on. Global Profitability: Q1 Results & Q2 Outlook Consolidated Q1 net income was $3 million ($0.05 EPS) and includes a $16 million loss on extinguishment of debt, net of taxes, related to the refinancing of our 8.5% bond in February. Excluding this loss, our net income would have been $19 million ($0.31 EPS), above our guidance because of the outperformance across all three of our operating segments. Net income, excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt, was up sequentially as an $18 million increase in domestic streaming contribution profit and a $28 million decrease in international losses more than offset a $14 million decline of DVD contribution profit and an increase in global operating costs. In Q2, our guidance implies net income roughly flat with Q1 (absent the loss on extinguishment of debt). We had a tax benefit in Q1 related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit that will not repeat in Q2, so higher sequential operating profit will be partially offset by higher sequential taxes. Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow of negative $42 million was $45 million lower than our positive $3 million in net income in the quarter primarily due to payments for Originals and non-originals content in excess of the P&L expense, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of the debt (a financing activity) and non-cash stock compensation expense. The investments that will continue to weigh on our cash flow relative to net income are Originals and non-Originals content (ongoing) and our Open Connect conversion (primarily in 2013). 7Capital In February, we raised $500 million in 8 year 5.375% notes with investment-grade covenants and used approximately $225 million of the proceeds to retire our 2007 8.5% notes. The refinancing of the notes, while being favorable to capital costs in the long term, was the basis for the $25 million pretax, or $16 million net of tax, loss on extinguishment of debt in the quarter. With the fundraising, we finished the quarter with a little over $1 billion in cash and equivalents. Market conditions were attractive and we were pleased to add cash to increase our reserves and afford us the flexibility to invest in additional Originals. We will convert the 2011 TCV $200 million convertible notes tomorrow (April 23rd) into the corresponding 2.3 million shares. We report diluted EPS as if the debt was converted, so our guidance for Q2 EPS already accounts for these shares, and there is no change to our cash on hand from this conversion.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share provide useful information as these measures exclude losses that are not indicative of our core operating results. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our approach to licensing content; member acquisition seasonality; expansion to additional international markets and international contribution profits (losses); impact and value of our original content; marketing strategy; improvements in our member experience, including the rollout of our profiles and social features; conversion of our $200M convertible notes; business outlook for our DVD segment; free cash flow and usage of cash; member growth, including total and paid; revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2013. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013.

       "  'We have grown to nearly 30 million domestic members and 8 million international members. Q2 streaming revenue was up 26% domestically and 155% internationally over prior year. Our first set of Netflix Originals earned 14 Emmy Award nominations, including “House of Cards” for Outstanding Drama Series. This is the first time an Internet TV show has been nominated for top Emmy awards. We invite you to watch our live video interview at youtube.com/netflixir at 3pm Pacific today. Summary Q2 Results & Q3 Guidance Midpoints 1Domestic Streaming As the table above shows, we are generating steady growth in members, revenue, and contribution profit. Our content mix, streaming and user experiences are all getting better and devices and bandwidth are improving. Countering this, competitors for consumer attention are also all improving, and the risk of U.S. market saturation only grows as we do. Given these competing forces, we are very happy this year to be tracking slightly ahead of prior year in terms of net additions. We generally expect net additions in Q2 to be lower than prior year Q2 due to increased net-add seasonality as we grow. This Q2, however, was an exception, we believe due to the launch of Arrested Development. This show already had a strong brand and fan base, generating a small but noticeable bump in membership when we released it. Other great shows don’t have that noticeable effect in their first season because they are less established. Our contribution margin has now grown faster than our target for several quarters (up 610 basis points from Q2 2012 on a target of 400). In addition to growing members at a faster rate than expected, our outperformance is due to timing shifts on content deals and to a lesser degree just spending less on content than expected. We are growing domestic content spend significantly and plan to continue to do so. We’ve generally talked about how we’re focused on 100 bps of sequential quarterly expansion, and how the lumpiness of content deals can make the q/q pattern somewhat irregular. Going forward, we’ll slightly modify the articulation of our target from “an average of 100 bps per quarter” to “400 bps per year.” In Q3, our guidance midpoint implies 130 bps of further margin expansion as we continue to run above our target. For Q4, we anticipate stepping up content spending even more, getting us closer to our 400 bps per year target. We’ll keep targeting about 400 basis points of annual improvement into 2014 if we keep growing net additions at 2012/2013 levels. In the quarter, we allowed our broad content deal with MTV Networks to expire. As we have said in the past, it is our preference to license specific shows that our members love in an exclusive manner. While the shows from Nickelodeon and Comedy Central came off our service, we introduced several new shows from Disney Jr., The Cartoon Network and the HUB for kids, and great comedies like “The New Girl” from Fox on July 1. Viewing and retention remain strong. TV Everywhere continues to steadily improve, with, for example, the HBO Go app now available on AppleTV. Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant Video continue to license some exclusive content and develop their own Originals. We have House of Cards and many others; Hulu has Battleground; and Amazon Prime Instant Video will have Alpha House; all are quite good and quite different. All three services are becoming more distinct from one another, like HBO, Showtime and Starz are distinct from one another on linear TV. Of our “top 200” titles, Hulu is now at 36 titles and Amazon Prime Instant Video is at 68. Now that Hulu has more money to spend, content prices may rise further, but we have many multi-year deals in 2place to mitigate this. Hulu and Amazon appear to have about the same amount of viewing, and Hulu recently reported 4 million paying members. International Streaming Our International streaming segment saw membership growth in all markets. Net additions a year ago were boosted by our UK/Ireland launch, so we are very happy to match in Q2 the net additions of a year ago given we had no new territory launch in the first half of this year. As our guidance implies, we expect Q3 net additions to be above Q3 of last year, bolstered in part by the launch of Netflix Netherlands within the quarter. In Latin America, we continued to see strong growth of new members in Brazil after our April price change from 15 BRL to 17 BRL. Prices update in August for grandfathered members but we expect a relatively small impact. Most prices in Brazil are rising due to substantial inflation. Q2 international contribution loss was lower than expected due to slightly higher member growth and lower than anticipated growth in content spending across multiple markets. We plan to grow our international content investments in Q3 slightly ahead of revenues. This growth combined with the losses associated with the launch of the Netherlands results in our guidance reflecting a q/q increase in our combined international contribution loss. Netherlands is about half the size of Canada, and is a good opportunity for us as we prepare for entry into more markets. We’ll continue to expand in 2014 based upon the progression of our existing markets and on confidence in the expansion opportunities. Originals For years we have featured a broad selection of movies and TV series licensed from others, and we continue to improve the quality of this offering while seeking to differentiate Netflix by licensing that content exclusively. This licensed content accounts for the bulk of viewing and leads to a lot of member enjoyment. Over the last six months, our move into Original programming has begun to redefine Netflix in the eyes of consumers. Our first five series -- Lilyhammer, House of Cards, Hemlock Grove, Arrested Development Season 4, and Orange is the New Black -- have engaged large audiences across our markets and are very different, allowing us to broaden our overall reach with each new Original. We assess the success of each Original by looking at viewing-to-date and estimated future viewing, relative to cost. So far, we’ve ordered second seasons of all first season projects, which is quite unusual and exciting for the fans of these shows. We’d be delighted to produce a fifth season of Arrested Development, if possible, given fan reaction. 3We are thrilled to have the Netflix Originals nominated for 14 Emmys, with House of Cards earning nine nominations including Outstanding Drama, Arrested Development garnering three, and Hemlock Grove two. We couldn’t be more proud and pleased for the series creators, actors, composers, designers and others who are being recognized by their peers for the excellence of their storytelling on Netflix. Later this month, we will premiere Mako Mermaids, a series aimed at teen audiences, while for the remainder of 2013 we will launch the Ricky Gervais series Derek and season two of Lilyhammer, followed by Turbo: F.A.S.T.(Fast Action Stunt Team), our first animated Original from DreamWorks Animation. We’re excited about our plans for 2014 and beyond as we premiere season two of House of Cards, Hemlock Grove, and Orange is the New Black, and debut Sense 8, and multiple kids Originals from DreamWorks Animation. Beyond series, we will be expanding our Originals initiative to include broadly appealing feature documentaries and stand-up comedy specials. Netflix has become a big destination for fans of these much loved and often under-distributed genres. We’ll continue to build on our initial success with Originals as we gain confidence in our ability to use our judgment and data to find projects that our members will enjoy. Based on the viewing trends we see with other similar television series, we are amortizing Originals on a straight-line basis over the shorter of 4 years or the license period1. We are in the early stages of Originals and continue to monitor whether the viewing pattern is enough higher in the first few months to have us amortize at a faster initial rate, and then to continue on a straight-line basis for the remainder of the amortization period. In terms of relative size, of the approximately $3 billion in content library net book value we are amortizing, currently around 5% is for Originals. Streaming Service Getting Better Our Product Innovation teams greatly enhanced the features and delivery of our service during the quarter, as well as improved discovery and merchandising of our content library. During Q2, we rolled out a new streaming player platform to all partners and began work towards a single UI to run across multiple devices that will be optimized for various input devices (voice interactions, pointer, and left/right/up/down controllers). The new platform and UI are optimized for better performance and faster starts and allow us to increase the number of platforms on which we can conduct AB testing for even more rapid innovation. In Q2, we also continued to focus efforts on improving our recommendation algorithms to help our members discover great content. Our recommendation algorithms create a highly personalized 1If a subsequent season is added, we extend the remaining amortization period by a year. 4experience for each of our streaming members, allowing them to easily find content they’ll love and allowing us to optimize the utility of the content library. Constant innovation in this important area (more than ¾ of the hours streamed on Netflix come from personalized suggestions generated by our recommendation algorithms) continues across a variety of dimensions. We continue improving features which will facilitate social interaction among members by allowing them to provide direct recommendations to one another, provide feedback about those recommendations and to share them with mutual friends. In Q3, we’ll be rolling out our profiles features which will allow households to have distinct “profiles” for different members or viewing tastes within their home, enabling us to provide a much more personalized experience for our members. Our default $7.99 plan includes two simultaneous streams. We added an additional plan, at $11.99, that includes 4 simultaneous streams for the few large families that would otherwise need two separate accounts and partition their TVs between the two accounts. As expected, the take rate on this large family plan is minimal. Our default limit of two simultaneous streams keeps password sharing with non- household members to a minimum because it risks the account owner not being able to watch when they want. Marketing With our new Watch Responsibly ads, we’ve sought to tell a fun and emotional story that ties consumers to the Netflix brand and highlight attributes of our service that drive certain consumer behaviors - like watching ahead, spoiling it for others, and marathon viewing. We didn’t invent these behaviors, but they’ve become associated with Netflix and highlight the fundamental changes in the way consumers are enjoying TV series and movies. We’ve also begun to shine an even more effective light on the great content available on Netflix, particularly our Originals. Each Original has been backed by distinctive marketing and promotional campaigns that have served to increase awareness of our service and to trigger engagement among both members and non-members. The publicity surrounding Originals has been very substantial and generally very positive, leading in turn to improved perception of the quality of content on our service and on the value we offer to members. 5DVD The huge selection we offer on DVD continues to be a draw for over 7 million households. DVD contribution profit declined 19% y/y, in line with the decline in member/revenues, as most of the costs scale with member/shipment levels. We continue to anticipate being able to maintain approximately the margins we’ve posted in the first half of 2013 throughout the full year. Consistent with our view in prior quarters, we don’t foresee USPS service changes that will have a material negative impact upon us or our members over the next few quarters. Free Cash Flow & Capital Free cash flow was +$13 million in Q2, a swing to positive reflecting the relatively fewer content payments in the quarter and strong global profit growth. Our investments in content, including Originals, will continue to weigh on FCF relative to net income and thus our FCF trends. In April, we converted the 2011 TCV $200 million convertible notes to the corresponding 2.3 million shares as discussed in our Q1 letter. Our sole remaining long-term debt is the $500 million notes we raised in February, which is due in 2021. We continue to have just over a $1 billion in cash and equivalents. 6Business Outlook For investor convenience we placed the midpoints of our guidance ranges in the table at the beginning of this letter. This does not make the midpoint the “goal”. Our best estimate is we will be within the ranges below. The ranges below are our guidance. Summary We are thrilled to be pleasing more members than ever. The world is moving from linear TV to Internet TV and Netflix is leading that evolution.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding meeting domestic contribution margin targets; investments in content, particularly exclusive and original content; subscriber acquisition seasonality; potential effects of competition and market saturation; international contribution margin and impacts arising from expansion to the Netherlands; improvements to our service, including the rollout of profiles and social features; content accounting for originals; business outlook for our DVD segment, including contribution margins and the impact of USPS service changes; free cash flow and usage of cash; member growth, including total and paid; revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the third quarter of 2013. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter. 9Netflix, Inc.

       "  'We are very pleased to have over 40 million members, up from less than 30 million just one year ago. The Netflix original series Orange is the New Black is a critical and popular success, and our earlier series House of Cards is the first Internet TV series to win a Primetime Emmy Award. We launched our 41st country and the Dutch seem to like Netflix. Our summary results and Q4 guidance midpoints are below: (in millions except per share data) Q3 \\'12 Q4 \\'12 Q1 \\'13 Q2 \\'13 Q3 \\'13 Q4 \\'13 Guidance Midpoint Domestic: Net Additions 1.16 2.05 2.03 0.63 1.29 2.01 Total Members 25.10 27.15 29.17 29.81 31.09 33.10 Paid Members 23.80 25.47 27.91 28.62 29.93 31.45 Revenue $ 556 $ 589 $ 639 $ 671 $ 701 $ 736 Contribution Profit $ 96 $ 113 $ 131 $ 151 $ 166 $ 171 Contribution Margin 17.2% 19.2% 20.6% 22.5% 23.7% 23.2% International: Net Additions 0.69 1.81 1.02 0.61 1.44 1.31 Total Members 4.31 6.12 7.14 7.75 9.19 10.50 Paid Members 3.69 4.89 6.33 7.01 8.08 9.40 Revenue $ 78 $ 101 $ 142 $ 166 $ 183 $ 217 Contribution Profit (Loss) $ (92) $ (105) $ (77) $ (66) $ (74) $ (65) Contribution Margin -118.8% -103.2% -54.2% -39.7% -40.6% -30.0% Total (including DVD): Revenue $ 905 $ 945 $ 1,024 $ 1,069 $ 1,106 Operating Income $ 16 $ 20 $ 32 $ 57 $ 57 Net Income $ 8 $ 8 $ 3 $ 29 $ 32 $ 37 EPS $ 0.13 $ 0.13 $ 0.05 $ 0.49 $ 0.52 $ 0.60 Free Cash Flow $ (20) $ (51) $ (42) $ 13 $ 7 Shares (FD) 58.7 59.1 60.1 60.6 61.0 1Domestic Domestic net additions of 1.3 million were 11% higher than prior year Q3 due to the growing strength of our content offering, aided by the great press coverage and social buzz generated by Orange is the New Black and our Emmy nominations, and the softer comp in Q3 2012 from the impact of the summer Olympics. We expect Q4 net additions to be approximately equal to Q4 of the prior year and to expand our contribution margin about 400 basis points year over year to about 23%, assuming the midpoint of our guidance. This means that sequentially our target contribution margin is slightly down Q3 to Q4. As a reminder, we shifted our contribution margin target a few months ago from “100 basis points of quarterly sequential improvement” to “400 basis points Q over prior year Q” so we are right on target with our articulated margin growth strategy. Our $7.99 price is working very well for us for both membership growth and contribution margin growth. While our original series get most of the headlines, a bigger percentage of overall Netflix viewing is generated by our exclusive complete season-after series. During the quarter, we launched new seasons of The New Girl, The Walking Dead, Scandal, Breaking Bad, Revolution and Pretty Little Liars. We also announced that Netflix will be the exclusive home to high quality first-run Pay1 films from The Weinstein Company beginning in 2016. Our kids offering was strengthened during the quarter by adding top rated and award winning Scholastic TV shows, Goosebumps and The Magic School Bus. We also announced an expanded list of PBS shows including Super Why!, Wild Kratts, Caillou and Arthur, as well as all seasons of the critically-acclaimed mystery The Bletchley Circle. International International net additions were way up from the prior year at 1.4 million new members, driven by our expansion to the Nordics and the Netherlands since last Q3, as well as growth in our existing markets from our steadily improving service, content and marketing. In addition, there was a surge in low quality free trials in September in Latin America that temporarily boosted the total member number. The paid net adds remain a reliable indicator of progress. Our Q3 international contribution loss was $74 million, as we saw flat to slight sequential improvements in contribution profits in all international markets during the quarter, offset by the Netherlands launch expense. In Q4, assuming the midpoint of our guidance, we expect continued momentum to result in about 1.3 million net additions, to end 2013 with 10.5 million international members. This compares to 1.8 million net additions in Q4 a year ago, which was our Nordics launch quarter. In all our other markets (Canada, Latin America, UK/IE, Netherlands), we expect net additions to be steady or up on a Q4 over Q4 basis. Sequentially, we expect international total member net adds in Q4 to be flat to down (1.4 million in Q3 to 1.3 million) as we work through the low-quality Latin America free trials from Q3, but paid net adds in Q4 are forecasted to rise (1.1 million in Q3 to 1.3 million). 2For Q4, we expect our contribution losses to improve to $65 million, assuming the midpoint of our guidance. We plan to launch in new markets next year, executing on the strategy outlined in our long term view letter. Our success this year in increasing international net additions to nearly the level of our domestic net additions shows substantial momentum and confirms our belief there is a big international opportunity for Netflix. Original Content An excellent summary of our early progress in original content is this two-minute video. Over the next few years we aspire to support creation of some of the most compelling and remarkable content ever produced. Coupled with the flexibility of our Internet viewing and power of our personal recommendations we will keep changing television for the better. Orange is the New Black has been a tremendous success for us. It will end the year as our most watched original series ever and, as with each of our other previously launched originals, enjoys an audience comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV. We have seen sustained social media buzz in the months after its debut and it is also one of the most critically well received TV shows of 2013. Orange is the New Black was not eligible for the Emmys in 2013, but Season 1 will be eligible next year and we believe the audience for Season 2 will grow substantially. Speaking of Emmys, we were thrilled to be a part of TV history in the quarter by winning 3 Emmy awards (3 of our original series received 14 total nominations). David Fincher’s win for Outstanding Director in a Drama Series made House of Cards the first TV series to win a major primetime Emmy without ever airing on a broadcast network or cable channel. We were delighted for David as well as Laray Mayfield and Julie Schubert who won for Outstanding Casting in a Drama Series and Eigil Bryld who picked up an Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single Camera Series. In addition to Orange is the New Black, during Q3, we launched the new Ricky Gervais series Derek and broadened our original content offering with the acquisition of high profile stand up comedy specials from Russell Peters and Aziz Ansari, premiering exclusively on Netflix in October and November, respectively. We also rolled out a second set of episodes of Mako Mermaids, our original series directed at the teen audience, and will soon expand into original documentaries, a category that does well on the Netflix service. This quarter we will premiere our inaugural second season of a Netflix original series with the return of Lilyhammer starring Steven Van Zandt. We will also be launching our first animated original series with Dreamworks Animation, Turbo F.A.S.T. 3In 2014, we expect to double our investment in original content (though still representing less than 10% of our overall global content expense). Coming to Netflix next year will be second seasons of House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Derek and Hemlock Grove as well as the just announced project from Todd and Glenn Kessler and Daniel Zelman, the Emmy and Golden Globe nominated creators of Damages. We’ll also roll out a number of new animated series from DreamWorks Animation. Expect more news on additional new original projects in the months to come. When we started with original content we didn’t have specific data about viewing patterns over time for content that premieres on Netflix. We decided to use straight line amortization based on our experience with TV series from other networks. Now we have more specific viewing data for original content which shows more viewing in the early months of a show’s debut, so we are accelerating the amortization of such content commensurately. We’ll continue to monitor the viewing patterns and adjust the amortization schedule as appropriate. Marketing Our global marketing campaigns promote compelling content, unique product features and the joy of the Netflix experience. These messages are adapted market by market to form deeper brand connections with our customers wherever they live. Q3 saw the launch of our Netherlands ‘All You Can Watch’ campaign and new advertising in the Nordic countries and Brazil, all of which communicate our brand proposition nuanced for local tastes. We continue to feature our content in advertising. Our goal is to shape customer perceptions of our catalog through an always-on layer of content marketing targeted at specific demographic groups. Last month we launched “TV Too” in which we are promoting the wealth of TV series on Netflix, taking advantage of the tremendous influx of new seasons coming into the service with the message ‘Discover, Relive, Start from the Beginning’. With regard to online advertising, we continue to improve our global efficiency and targeting with investments in programmatic and online video advertising. Our aim is to target consumers with the right message at the right stage of their consumer journey in both direct response and brand messages. Product During Q3, we launched profiles, offering individual personalization for each member of a household and “My List” to help all members save titles to watch later in a more organized and adaptive manner than our prior Instant Queue, which was available only to U.S. members. Both of these features help members find and engage with films and TV series matched to their individual tastes. 4The growth of smart TVs and Internet TV devices, such as AppleTV, Roku, and Chromecast, are increasing the availability of TV streaming platforms. Tablets and phones also are rapidly growing as Netflix viewing platforms. We launched with Virgin Media, the UK’s leading cable company, a world first: Netflix on a major cable set-top box. It is rolling out over this quarter to Virgin Media’s subscribers. The integration of search and suggestions between broadband and cable is great for customers, and we want this superior experience to help Virgin Media gain market share in the UK. Cable operators like Virgin Media believe that by enabling their subscribers to do more with their cable set-top and remote, they can increase satisfaction, relative to their subscribers using a separate Internet set-top box or smart TV to enjoy Netflix. We are open to more of these integrations with cable set-tops around the world, but given the fragmented technology footprints, we think it will be many years before cable set-top boxes match Internet set-top boxes for Netflix streaming volume. As a general rule, we’re happy to support devices from other video providers as long as we get application placement commensurate with our popularity. DVD The huge selection we offer on DVD, including all the HBO and other Pay TV series, continues to be a source of satisfaction for 7.15 million domestic households, and we generated $107 million of contribution profit, as expected. With the USPS rate announcement in September, we anticipate a postal rate increase in January of 3 cents each way or $3-4 million per quarter of additional expense in 2014. Profitability We were pleased with our global profitability for Q3. We delivered on our targets despite the faster amortization of original content, which pulled forward into Q3 about $27 million in expense from future quarters, due to more members and revenue than expected and by adjusting spending in Q3 on other items. The effect of the faster amortization of original content is small enough that we are not changing our domestic contribution margin targets (400 basis points Q over prior year Q) or our global profitability targets (stay profitable despite international investments). 5Stock Volatility In calendar year 2003 we were the highest performing stock on Nasdaq. We had solid results compounded by momentum-investor-fueled euphoria. Some of the euphoria today feels like 2003. Despite the huge swings in our stock price since our 2002 IPO ($8 to $3 to $39 to $8 to $300 to $55 to $330), we’ve continued to grow our membership every year fairly steadily. We do our best to ignore the volatility in our stock. The progress we’ve made over the last 10 years is stunning. We want to make the next 10 years even more remarkable. Business Outlook We have also updated our long term view letter.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding meeting domestic contribution margin targets; international contribution losses; expansion into new geographic markets and the impact of international expansion; investments in content, particularly original content, including second seasons of original content and new categories of original content; business outlook for our DVD segment, including contribution profit and the impact of a USPS rate increase; the rate and impact of integration on cable set-top boxes; member growth domestically and internationally, including total and paid; revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. The forward- looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter. 8Netflix, Inc.

The healthy y/y growth in net additions was likely fueled by our service improvements, marketing effectiveness, and sales of Internet connected devices. We expect this momentum to continue in Q1 with net additions of 2.25 million to exceed the prior year by about 11%. Running equal to, or slightly above, prior year net additions is a great outcome because it implies that at 33 million domestic members we’re still in the middle section of the S curve of consumer adoption, with years of member growth ahead of us. Our US contribution margin during the quarter increased 420 basis points y/y to 23.4%, as we continued to grow membership and revenue faster than content expense. Over the past 8 quarters since we first broke out the streaming segment, our contribution margin has expanded significantly from the 12.2% posted in Q4’11. Our strong results indicate that a 30% quarterly contribution margin may start being achievable in 2015. At 30%, we’d re-evaluate the right margin growth target, given conditions at that time. To the extent our contribution margin climbs above 30%, it will get harder to keep it growing at 400 basis points per year. Last April we introduced a 4-concurrent stream $11.99 option to begin our evaluation of plan tiering. Since late last year, we have also been testing 1-stream and 3-stream variants, as well as SD/HD variations, at various price points. Eventually, we hope to be able to offer new members a selection of three simple options to fit everyone’s taste. If we do make pricing changes for new members, existing members would get generous grandfathering of their existing plans and prices, so there would be no material near-term revenue increase from moving to this potential broader set of options. We are in no rush to implement such new member plans and are still researching the best way to proceed. As a reminder, Q2 net additions will typically be less than the prior year, even in a year where total net additions are up, due to increased seasonality that comes with a bigger member base. (See the very end of our Q1 2012 earnings letter for an explanation.) In addition, in Q2 2013 we launched Arrested Development, which had a strong established brand and passionate fan base, generating a small boost in membership, making Q2 2014 a tougher than normal comp period. Our domestic growth is very strong, much of which should be attributed to the tailwind of Internet video growth in general. Hulu had 3 CEOs in 2013, and yet grew paid subscribers an impressive 65%. We think YouTube, Amazon Instant Video, iTunes video and BBC iPlayer are also growing fast. In the traditional MVPD sector, there is lots of activity that may affect us on the margin. Verizon is buying the Intel Internet MVPD system and recently bought a CDN (EdgeCast) and streaming software 2firm (UpLynk). These are big investments, so they clearly have big plans. Sony announced they are launching an Internet MVPD system this year. Finally, depending on the decision of the Supreme Court, Aereo will either have to pay for the broadcast content like MVPDs, or the MVPDs will no longer be obliged to pay. Within the MVPD ecosystem, there are potentially big shake ups. In contrast, we continue licensing and producing more exclusive content for our direct-to-consumer business, and are relatively unaffected by the big bundle questions. International We’re making great progress internationally, with strong member growth and contribution profit/loss improving sequentially in all of our markets (with the exception of the Netherlands as it had its first full quarter of operations and thus loss in Q4). We saw healthy growth in net additions of 1.74 million in Q4 to end the year at 10.93 million members, slightly above our guidance. As anticipated, Q4 net additions were down slightly from the prior year Q4, as we launched four Nordic markets in Q4 2012 versus the relatively smaller Netherlands launch in Q3 2013. In Q1 of 2014, we are forecasting an almost 60% increase in net additions from the prior year, from 1.02 million to 1.60 million. We’ve seen increases in consumer brand awareness and likelihood to recommend across markets as our content offering builds and marketing messages are honed, factors that help drive the y/y growth in net additions. Throughout 2013 we made substantial progress in improving our contribution losses - a 30% improvement over FY 2012 - while also launching a small market. In Q1, we expect to continue this progress and expect a contribution loss of ($42) million, a $15 million sequential improvement. In Ireland, on January 10th, we increased our monthly subscription price for new members by one Euro from €6.99 to €7.99, bringing Ireland pricing in line with our other Euro-zone countries. Existing members in Ireland received two-year grandfathering of their existing €6.99 pricing. Because of this grandfathering, there will be no material revenue impact from this change in 2014. It’s too early to tell if this change will materially affect our growth in Ireland. We plan later this year to embark on a substantial European expansion. Our success this year in international net additions and shrinking contribution losses confirms our belief that there is a big international opportunity for Netflix. Content We continued to expand our original content offerings in the quarter, launching a second season of Lilyhammer starring Steven Van Zandt, the first five episodes of our first original animated series for 3kids, Turbo F.A.S.T., from DreamWorks Animation, original standup comedy specials featuring Aziz Ansari and Russell Peters and the original documentary The Short Game. So far, Netflix original series have received over 80 major award nominations and wins, including Emmy and Golden Globe recognition of House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Arrested Development and Hemlock Grove. House of Cards and Orange is the New Black were also included in the American Film Institute’s list of the best 10 TV series of the year. Our recently launched original documentary The Square was also just nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. We could not be more pleased with -- and proud of -- our first slate of original content. Timed for family viewing over the holidays, Turbo F.A.S.T has been very popular with kids around the world, performing especially strong throughout Latin America. As we had hoped, the global theatrical and home video release of the DreamWorks Animation film based on the same characters helped position the series for success. Though just launched, Turbo F.A.S.T. is on track to become one of the most popular kids series ever on Netflix. The second season of Lilyhammer was our first ever for a Netflix original series. The show is finding a broader audience, as we have introduced new English speaking characters and more global storylines. Season 3 has recently begun production in Norway and the creators again plan to add characters that will further broaden the appeal of this already very international show. In 2014, we anticipate building on our tremendous momentum with new seasons of House of Cards (Feb. 14th), Derek, Hemlock Grove, Orange is the New Black, Lilyhammer, and a fully exclusive, final season of The Killing; as well as additional episodes of Turbo F.A.S.T., and premiere launches of our first original animated series for adults, BoJack Horseman, and an epic series based on the adventures of Marco Polo from The Weinstein Co., and additional new kids series from DreamWorks Animation. We’re also thrilled to continue to bring high quality documentaries exclusively to our members. In addition to The Square, later this week we’ll globally release MITT, the Gala premiere opening film at the Sundance Film Festival this year. Looking into early 2015, we anticipate the release of the first season of Sense8 from the Wachowski siblings and J. Michael Straczynski, the as-yet unnamed project from the creators of Damages, and Daredevil, the first series from our recently announced deal with Marvel Television. Beyond our fully original series, Netflix will exclusively premiere new episodes of Better Call Saul, the hotly anticipated spin-off of Breaking Bad in the UK and Ireland, throughout Latin America, the Nordics and the Netherlands. Those episodes will premiere in North America on Netflix following their run on AMC. As part of that deal, we expanded and extended our exclusive deal for the entire Breaking Bad series to all of our territories. The final 8 episodes of the now iconic show will hit Netflix in North America on Feb. 24th. Breaking Bad has proven to be a global success for us and we expect Better Call Saul to be very popular with our members as well. 4Marketing In the US we launched in late November a new holiday campaign called “It Just Might Bring Everyone Together”. The ad is simple and timely and positions Netflix as a part of the holiday/family experience. We made steady progress in our international marketing efforts this quarter. We launched a new campaign in Brazil introducing Netflix to a broader audience with positive results in terms of brand awareness and familiarity of the attributes of our service. We also launched a new advertising campaign in Canada over the holidays that played into the deep Canadian affection for hockey. Product We ended 2013 with our best product ever and one substantially better than a year ago. Notably during Q4, we rolled out our new user-interface for TV devices, a material step forward not only objectively in terms of engagement metrics, but in terms of press and public attention. This user interface is coupled with our new technology platform for TV devices, which has a smaller footprint and is higher performing, allowing us to reach lower-powered devices and enabling future growth into new areas. During the quarter, we also completed the roll out of the Netflix streaming application into Virgin Media’s set-top box for UK members and have been quite pleased with the implementation and reception. We followed up with two similar platforms based on the same technology, Denmark’s Waoo! which went live in Q4, and Com Hem in Sweden, which was just recently launched. We anticipate rolling out our first domestic MVPD integrations soon with some of the smaller MVPDs. At CES this year, we promoted Ultra High Definition (UHD) 4K technology with several key consumer electronics partners, announcing that House of Cards season 2 will be in 4K as well as all 5 seasons of Breaking Bad, and our future original series. 4K streams are encoded at 15.6Mbps, well within reach of a significant minority of our members, and the reach of capable 20Mbps broadband connections will continue to grow. Since the number of 4K displays sold in 2014 and the number of available hours of 4K content both will be relatively modest, the short-term impact of 4K is mainly on consumer perception of Netflix as a leader in Internet TV. We continue to invest in personalization for content discovery, which adds value to our content catalogs by presenting more relevant content to each user, driving more hours of viewing and better retention. In January, we received our second Emmy Award for Technical Achievement in recognition of our personalization technology. 5Net Neutrality Unfortunately, Verizon successfully challenged the U.S. net neutrality rules. In principle, a domestic ISP now can legally impede the video streams that members request from Netflix, degrading the experience we jointly provide. The motivation could be to get Netflix to pay fees to stop this degradation. Were this draconian scenario to unfold with some ISP, we would vigorously protest and encourage our members to demand the open Internet they are paying their ISP to deliver. The most likely case, however, is that ISPs will avoid this consumer-unfriendly path of discrimination. ISPs are generally aware of the broad public support for net neutrality and don’t want to galvanize government action. Moreover, ISPs have very profitable broadband businesses they want to expand. Consumers purchase higher bandwidth packages mostly for one reason: high-quality streaming video. ISPs appear to recognize this and many of them are working closely with us and other streaming video services to enable the ISPs subscribers to more consistently get the high-quality streaming video consumers desire. In the long-term, we think Netflix and consumers are best served by strong network neutrality across all networks, including wireless. To the degree that ISPs adhere to a meaningful voluntary code of conduct, less regulation is warranted. To the degree that some aggressive ISPs start impeding specific data flows, more regulation would clearly be needed. DVD 6.9 million DVD members continue to value the tremendous selection we offer on DVD. Contribution profit was roughly stable at $110 million. We expect $98 million in contribution profit for Q1, which reflects the postal rate increase implemented this month and higher seasonal usage. In the coming months, we’ll begin using dvd.netflix.com on our envelopes and on the DVD web pages. The dvd.netflix.com logo will feature our iconic envelope in a nod to our DVD-by-mail heritage, representing the huge selection that DVD offers; nearly every movie ever made. Free Cash Flow and Capital Free cash flow was $5 million in Q4 compared to $48 million of net income, mostly due to cash spending on content being higher than P&L expense. While our cash and equivalents has risen to $1.2 billion, we anticipate embarking on substantially more international expansion and originals funding over the next few years. Given the current favorable interest rate environment, we think a prudent step in Q1 is to 6raise an additional $400 million of long-term debt on terms similar to our $500 million raise last year. At $900 million of total long term debt, we will have an extremely modest debt to equity ratio. Business Outlook Starting this quarter we are providing you our internal forecast numbers for the quarter in the table at the beginning of this letter. This internal forecast is based upon the first few weeks of the quarter, the historical pattern and other factors. This is our raw internal best-guess forecast, so we should land above it sometimes and below it sometimes. Our goal in this modest change of communication is to increase transparency and to simplify our message. Summary It’s been a good year for Netflix. People around the world want what we offer: consumer-in-control Internet television.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding domestic contribution margin targets; pricing structure and changes; expansion into new geographic markets and the impact of international expansion; investments in content and content offerings, including original content; impact of technology developments such as 4K and growth of high speed broadband connections; impacts relating to net neutrality; business outlook for our DVD segment, including contribution profit; obtaining additional capital; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of 2014. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion 8of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter. 9Netflix, Inc.

Our net additions for Q1 were 0.22 million more than prior year Q1. As we’ve discussed previously, U.S. net additions in Q2 will generally be lower than in the prior year Q2, even in a year with full year growth, due to increased seasonality. This Q2, we expect our domestic net additions to be about 0.11 million below the prior year Q2. International performance in Q1 was also strong. Membership grew by 1.75 million, bringing our international total to 12.7 million members with 72% more net additions than prior year Q1. Due to rapid growth in our international segment we aren’t experiencing the same level of seasonality as in the U.S., and we anticipate over 50% y/y growth in Q2 net additions despite slight headwinds from the World Cup. International revenues currently amount to 25% of our total streaming revenue and we anticipate our international segment to eventually surpass our U.S. market, similar to other Internet firms. International contribution losses shrank by $22 million q/q, with losses more than halved on a y/y basis due to the strong growth in paid members. Our present international segment is on a path to achieve profitability this year. However, our substantial expansion into new European markets (with corresponding investments in content and marketing) in the second half of 2014 will keep our expanded international segment at a net loss. As we’ve discussed in prior investor letters, we intend to continue our international expansion over the coming years, so our near term profits will be quite modest as we invest in this large global opportunity. Free cash flow in the quarter was $8 million versus net income of $53 million. As we’ve highlighted in previous letters, investments in our original series as well as certain non-original licenses, can require higher initial cash payments over the P&L expense. With further international expansion in the second half of this year reducing net income, we expect free cash flow in Q4 to also be reduced. Content Our original programming initiatives gained momentum in Q1. House of Cards, for which Season 2 debuted in February, attracted a huge audience that would make any cable or broadcast network happy. The on-demand nature of Netflix means that as we promote Season 2, we can still see significant new enjoyment of Season 1. Netflix members were able to watch the acclaimed documentary MITT within a week of its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival and we garnered our first Oscar nomination for the impactful documentary 2The Square. During the quarter, we also announced our first original live-action comedy series, Grace and Frankie, featuring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. Already this quarter, we’ve brought members additional episodes of Turbo F.A.S.T. On May 30, we will launch Season 2 of the Ricky Gervais series, Derek, in most territories and on June 6th, we’ll debut Season 2 of Orange is the New Black, giving our members around the globe the opportunity to immerse themselves in this rich and engaging world. The trailer will give you a sense of what’s in store for this tremendously popular show. Our summer line-up includes Hemlock Grove Season 2, the animated comedy series BoJack Horseman and the final six episodes of The Killing. Momentum will continue throughout 2014 and into 2015 as we bring our members additional kids series through our partnership with DreamWorks Animation, and launch new original series including the epic adventure of Marco Polo; a psychological thriller from the creators of Damages; Marvel‘s Daredevil; sci-fi drama Sense 8 from the Wachowskis, and Narcos, an action-drama series from Brazilian director José Padilha on the fall of Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. We are pleased with consumer reception to our early work, as demonstrated in a Morgan Stanley survey from March, showing that 17% of respondents viewed Netflix as the service that offered the best original programming, second only to HBO, and ahead of Showtime and Starz. To have achieved this recognition in our second year of original content creation is exciting and we are optimistic about building on our initial success. We compete for original series with many linear TV networks (CBS, FX, HBO, BBC, etc.) and several Internet firms (Amazon, Hulu, Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo, etc.). Our advantages against other Internet firms are our scale in video and our focus. Our advantages against linear TV networks are Internet on-demand consumption and targeted show marketing. The huge competition amongst all of us for great writers and producers means there’s never been a more robust market for quality serialized television. Outside of North America, we are also becoming the first-run home for many great U.S. TV series. We are releasing those series one episode per week, in order to reduce the time international viewers must wait for local availability. Traditionally, even the most popular American series are withheld from international viewers for several months at a minimum, which has contributed greatly to the growth of piracy. We are tightening that window to less than 7 days, and wherever possible, to within 24 hours. The Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul, as well as From Dusk Till Dawn and Fargo, are among the series premiering on Netflix in international territories. We also continue to invest heavily in exclusive syndication licenses for some of the best series on television. For example, in the U.S., as Mad Men enters its final season, members can jump in or catch up on every previous season’s episode on Netflix. The Walking Dead, Scandal, Bates Motel, The Following, New Girl, Sherlock and The Vampire Diaries are just a few of the exciting on-air series we offer 3exclusively in this model. Dexter, House and Breaking Bad are no longer in production, but continue to be discovered and enjoyed everyday by a huge Netflix audience. Marketing In Q1, our marketing focused on launching House of Cards Season 2 across our global markets. We will continue with this approach in Q2, with a significant push behind the global launch of Orange is the New Black Season 2 on June 6th. Original series represent a tremendous opportunity to raise awareness of, and build consumer enthusiasm for, the Netflix brand. We’ll be investing more in marketing high-quality exclusive content, and spending less on direct response advertising such as banner ads touting free trials. Internationally, we’ve been developing new brand marketing campaigns to strengthen our connection to local consumers. These campaigns are part of a global brand platform highlighting the many ways people find delight in the Netflix experience. Product Today you can walk into a store, buy a new 4K television, take it home, and enjoy a limited selection of streaming 4K content from Netflix. We have House of Cards Season 2 in 4K, as well as an assortment of nature documentaries. The recent WSJ review for one of the Samsung curved-screen 4K TVs featured our 4K content, which we want to be an increasing theme as 4K grows. As 4K TVs become less expensive and more accessible, we will increase our content available in 4K. The best quality consumer video in the world is now streaming Internet video, less than 10 years after YouTube’s 2005 start. We continue to test small and large ideas in promoting the right content to each user. In Q1, we refined and developed the way we promote our original series on the service to better support follow-on seasons, and we are exploring how to do so for selected exclusive catalog content. We also tested and rolled out our row-selection logic that chooses which categories of titles to show to each individual based upon their previous behavior. We remain very happy with the customer embrace of our MVPD set-top box integrations in Europe. This quarter we will launch the first MVPD integrations in the U.S. As we did in Europe, we will start with U.S. MVPDs that use the TiVo set-top box and try to extend to non-TiVo devices after that. From an MVPD point-of-view, they would rather have consumers use Netflix through the MVPD box and remote control than have consumers become accustomed to watching video from a smart TV or Internet TV device remote control. 4We continue to see more capable Internet television devices launched. Chromecast, Roku Streaming Stick, and Amazon Fire TV (on which we expect to support voice search later this year) push the quality of experience and price points for adapter products. Smart TVs from manufacturers like Sony, Samsung, LG and Vizio are starting to evolve from Internet TV as a “bolt-on” to Internet TV as a critical and integrated part of the overall device interface. Roku TV will likely be available in the Fall as one of the first Internet-centric TVs. We expect this trend to continually decrease the friction required for our members to access Netflix and enjoy great content. As expected, we saw limited impact from our January price increase for new members in Ireland (from €6.99 to €7.99), which included grandfathering all existing members at €6.99 for two years. In the U.S. we have greatly improved our content selection since we introduced our streaming plan in 2010 at $7.99 per month. Our current view is to do a one or two dollar increase, depending on the country, later this quarter for new members only. Existing members would stay at current pricing (e.g. $7.99 in the U.S.) for a generous time period. These changes will enable us to acquire more content and deliver an even better streaming experience. ISP Performance: AT&T Fiber slower than DSL from others Our long-term ISP performance index shows some positive data, and some surprising data, particularly in the U.S. The positive is that Comcast is providing a much improved Netflix experience to their broadband subscribers, and now nearly all cable Internet households receive great quality Internet video. The surprising news is that AT&T fiber-based U-verse has lower performance than many DSL ISPs, such as Frontier, CenturyLink & Windstream. This reinforces our view that connectivity to the broader Internet is critical to the quality of experience consumers receive. The 249 customer comments on AT&T’s anti-Netflix blog post indicate that AT&T customers expect a good quality Netflix experience given how much they pay AT&T for their Internet service. It is free and easy for AT&T to interconnect directly with Netflix and quickly improve their customers’ experience, should AT&T so desire. Strong Net Neutrality: No-fee Interconnect The Internet faces a long term threat from the largest ISPs driving up profits for themselves and costs for everyone else as detailed in our recent blog post. If the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined company’s footprint will pass over 60 percent1 of U.S. broadband households, after the proposed divestiture, with most of those homes having Comcast as the only option for truly high-speed broadband (>10Mbps). As DSL fades in favor of cable Internet, Comcast could control high-speed broadband to the majority of American 1 Adam Ilkowitz,” Surprise! Comcast Takes TWC,” Nomura Securities, February 13, 2014 5homes. Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit providers and services such as Netflix. The combined company would possess even more anti- competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers. For this reason, Netflix opposes this merger. Competition In Q1, Amazon changed strategies in the UK and Germany, closing LoveFilm as a streaming brand to compete with Netflix. They have repurposed their content deals to serve Amazon Prime Instant Video in the UK and Germany, and are investing in creating awareness of this new model. Amazon is not currently offering subscription video within Prime in Canada, France, Italy, Spain or Japan. They may choose to expand Prime Instant Video or to focus on tuning their three existing Prime Instant Video markets: U.S., UK and Germany. Since much of the content on Netflix and Amazon Prime (as well as Hulu in the U.S.) is mutually exclusive, many consumers see value in subscribing to all three networks. In general, we continue to believe that our biggest long-term competitor for entertainment time remains the MVPDs improving through TV Everywhere, as they are doing with HBO Go. 6.7 Million DVD Memberships Our DVD-by-mail business continues to delight 6.7 million members. As expected, contribution profit for the segment was $98 million in the quarter and we anticipate $92 million for Q2. The breadth of content choices available on DVD and Blu-ray is unrivaled. 6Summary We are approaching 50 million global members, but that is far short of HBO’s 130 million. We are eager to close the gap.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding pricing; international expansion and performance; content offerings; marketing; MVPD integration; IP interconnection; competition; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter. 8Netflix, Inc.

For Q3, we expect about 1.3 million net additions, comparable to Q3’13 in which we premiered Orange Season 1. We are pleased our net additions in the U.S. remain on par with last year. Our U.S. contribution margin expanded 460 bps y/y to 27.1%, as revenue continued to grow faster than spending on content and marketing. As previously mentioned, we’ll re-evaluate our current 400 bps y/y margin improvement target once we achieve a 30% contribution margin sometime next year. The three models we are evaluating are 400, 200, and 100 basis points margin improvement per year over the next few years. Outside the U.S., we generated continued growth in all of our markets. We ended Q2 with 13.8 million international members, growing 78% y/y. In September, we’ll be launching Netflix in Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg. This launch into markets with over 60 million broadband households will significantly increase our European presence and raise our current international addressable market to over 180 million broadband households, or 2x the number of current U.S. broadband households. Our international contribution loss of ($15.3) million has been rapidly approaching contribution profitability as we see improvements across all existing markets. Our broad success from Argentina to Finland has convinced us to further invest aggressively in global expansion. Our European expansion this quarter will add new expenses to the segment, so we expect a consolidated contribution loss of ($42) million for the international segment in Q3. Even after our upcoming expansion in Europe, we’ll only address about one-third (271 million of 728 million1 ) of current global broadband households, providing a great opportunity to build on our international success beyond 2014. As explained in our Long Term Letter, our plan remains to run at about global break-even to fund investment in global expansion. In May, we raised prices modestly in most of our markets for new members on our two screens at-a- time HD plan, and introduced a one screen at-a-time, standard definition plan across our markets. Our two screen HD plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new members. We expect ARPU to rise slowly as members at the new prices grow as a percentage of total membership. There was minimal impact on membership growth from this price change. 1 SNL Kagan 2Content Original Series The release of Orange is the New Black Season 2 has been every bit the global media event we had hoped for; critically acclaimed and embraced by a fervent and growing fan base. In its first month, Orange became the most watched series in every Netflix territory, with many members either watching for the first time or re-watching Season 1, in addition to the 13 new episodes of Season 2. Earlier this month, Netflix original series and documentaries received 31 Emmy nominations, more than double the 14 we received in our first year of releasing original programming. In its first year of eligibility, Orange received 12 nominations, more than any other comedy series, while nominations for House of Cards grew from 9 last year to 13 this year. Notably, these two shows were nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Drama Series while The Square, which received 4 nominations, is up for Outstanding Documentary. It is quite rare for a single network to receive nominations in all three of these categories as well as Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress for both drama (Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright for House of Cards) and comedy (Ricky Gervais for Derek and Taylor Schilling for Orange.) Hemlock Grove debuted July 11 and has already begun to build on its Season 1 audience. We have been very pleased with the second season of Derek that launched in May and with the launch of our latest original documentary The Battered Bastards of Baseball. In the coming weeks, we will premiere the all new 4th and final season of The Killing (8/1) and a new adult animated comedy BoJack Horseman (8/22). Also in August, we will release Mission Blue (8/15) from the Oscar-winning director of The Cove, Fisher Stevens. Reflecting the increasingly global nature of the Netflix service, we now have original series in production around the world, involving some of the best storytellers working in television and film today. Marco Polo, a historical adventure from Executive Producer Harvey Weinstein, is shooting in Kazakhstan and Malaysia. In New York there is Marvel’s Daredevil, the first of our original series from Marvel Television, as well as the already eagerly-anticipated third season of Orange is the New Black; while in Baltimore, production is underway on the third season of House of Cards. In the Florida Keys, the creators of Damages (Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman, and Todd Kessler) are shooting a dark family thriller with an ensemble cast led by Kyle Chandler, Sissy Spacek, Sam Shepard, Linda Cardellini, Ben Mendelsohn, and Norbert Leo Butz. Sense8, a mind-bending series from the Wachowskis (The Matrix trilogy, Cloud Atlas) and J. Michael Straczynski (Babylon 5), began production in San Francisco last month, is now in Chicago, and will shoot in many international locations this year. 3In August, production begins in Los Angeles on Grace and Frankie, a comedy led by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston; and in Colombia, Brazilian director José Padilha (Elite Squad, Robocop) will begin filming Narcos with an all-star international cast led by Wagner Moura. During the quarter, we announced our first-ever talk show, hosted by Chelsea Handler, the popular comedian and best-selling author. As with scripted programming, but unlike news or sports, fewer people are watching talk shows live and are instead watching stacked episodes on DVR or online in the days and weeks following initial airing. Our intent is to produce a show with Handler and her team that reflects this shift to on-demand enjoyment and that will appeal to a global audience. Handler recently taped her first special for Netflix -- a stand-up show that’s been sold out across the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland -- and will produce four more in 2015 before we launch the talk show in early 2016. Marketing In Q2 we focused our marketing on the launch of the second season of Orange is the New Black in each of our markets. This campaign represents our largest content marketing push to date and we are pleased with the reaction from fans. Social media sentiment was overwhelmingly positive and search volume validated that we had a big hit on our hands. Season 3 next year should be even bigger. Our Netflix brand advertising continues to resonate with consumers, highlighting the fun ways people’s lives are enriched when they watch something great. Our well-received You’ve Got to Get it To Get It campaign in Canada was extended with three new ads “Airport”, “Test Results”, and “Proposal” this quarter. We ran the first ad in the campaign, “Pep Talk”, during the NHL playoffs and were delighted when New York Rangers head coach Alain Vigneault picked up the joke during a pre-game press conference, leading the NHL Network to interview the coach from our ad. Another successful example of our brand advertising is our Viva Netflix campaign in Mexico which began with “Abuelita,” featuring a fun take on local family viewing habits, quickly followed by “Oribe” in which Mexico’s star striker returns home from the World Cup slightly earlier than his spouse expected. In Q2 we updated our logo from the red block with white letters to the cleaner red letters. We were pleased to execute this transition with the minimum of distraction. 4In-Store Gift Cards Coming This Fall We are introducing physical gift cards in select stores in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Germany starting later this year. In mature markets, gift cards will extend our brand presence and make it easier to access Netflix. In newer markets, gift cards help build the brand and provide an easier alternative for consumers to join Netflix in markets with developing online payments. Product MVPD Set-Top Boxes The Netflix app on Virgin Media set-top boxes in the U.K. continues to be a compelling streaming experience that delivers above-median viewing and satisfaction. We continue to gain traction in our international markets with set-top box integration and, in the U.S., launched the Netflix app on the TiVo platform with several regional MVPDs including Suddenlink, RCN, Grande and Atlantic Broadband during the quarter. MVPDs would rather their customers’ use Netflix on their set-top and remote than use Netflix on Internet set-tops such as Apple TV, partially because that drives the pay-per-view consumption for the respective set-top owner. Android TV Platform The Netflix app for Google\\'s Android TV platform will appear on TVs from Sony, Sharp, and others in the coming months. Widespread adoption of Android TV can reduce the number of different platforms we need to support to ensure Netflix is broadly available on Smart TVs delivering a consistently first-rate experience, no matter the vendor. Android TV incorporates Google\\'s \"cast\" feature, allowing content discovery on mobile devices and laptops with streaming delivered to the big screen. Smart TV growing in Latin America Post World Cup, the number of Smart TVs used for Netflix viewing in Latin American countries is at a new high; in fact, the percentage of viewing from Smart TVs in Latin America is higher than any other region we serve. Members accessing Netflix on a big screen generally watch more and retain better than members using smaller devices. UHD 4K Video Quality We are now streaming flagship content in UHD 4K to members with 4K Smart TVs, putting Netflix at the leading edge of high-quality AV delivery. Already, Samsung, LG, and Sony have in retail around the world 54K Smart TVs, and House of Cards Season 2 and all seasons of Breaking Bad are now available for streaming in the new format. Content available to stream in 4K will grow steadily as several of our original series are or will be shooting in 4K, including Marco Polo, Sense8, and Narcos. UHD 4K will be an Internet-centric format as linear TV will be late to switch their networks to UHD 4K. Strong Net Neutrality Our focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, is about preventing large ISPs from holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance to extract payments from us, other Internet content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent. Our policy goals are for the FCC to not sanctify paid prioritization, and for the DOJ/FCC to block the merger of Comcast/TWC, or at the very least, to require as condition to approving the merger that the combined entity be prevented from charging for interconnection. 6.3 Million U.S. DVD Memberships Our DVD-by-mail business continues to satisfy 6.3 million members. Contribution profit for the segment was $92.8 million in the quarter, as expected, and we anticipate $90 million for Q3. A year ago in Q2, we lost 475k DVD memberships. In Q2 this year it was only 391k. DVD and Blu-ray offer amazing and comprehensive selection that keeps a core membership uniquely satisfied. Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are here: April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013, October 2012, July 2012. Summary We have a huge global opportunity ahead and a lot of challenges too. We are thrilled for the creators of our original series and documentaries who earned 31 Emmy nominations this year, and whose incredible work is being enjoyed by many of our 50 million members. 6'),\n",

       "  \"Last quarter we added over 3 million members, ending Q3 with 53.1 million global members and $1.22 billion in revenue. We are forecasting adding another 4 million members in Q4, ending 2014 with over 57 million global members. Around the world, people are discovering the joy of Internet TV. With an incredible variety of original series, films and exclusive licensed content arriving on Netflix in the coming quarters, we will continue to thrill our members and expand our membership.

Domestic streaming revenue of $877 million, in-line with forecast, grew 25% y/y and faster than membership due to the expansion of ASP from the price changes implemented in Q2. We added two million members internationally, to end the quarter with 15.84 million members, with lower net adds than our forecast, but higher than prior year. International revenue of $346 million, in- line with forecast, grew 89% y/y, and faster than membership, again due to the expansion of our ASP. As a reminder, we provide you our internal forecast for the current quarter. For the prior three quarters, we under-forecasted membership growth. This quarter we over-forecasted membership growth. We’ll continue to give you our internal forecast for the current quarter, and it will be high some of the time and low other times. Separate from forecast variability, year on year net additions in the US were down (1.3 million in Q3 2013 to 1 million in Q3 2014). As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago. Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth, other things being equal, and this is manifested more clearly in higher adoption markets such as the US. In hindsight, we believe that late Q2 and early Q3 the impact of higher prices appeared to be offset for about two months by the large positive reception to Season Two of Orange is the New Black. We remain happy with the price changes and growth in revenue and will continue to improve our service, with better content, better streaming and better choosing. The effect of slightly higher prices is factored into our Q4 forecast. Since our per-member viewing and retention in the US are as strong as ever, we don’t think increased competition from piracy, TV Everywhere, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Hulu, etc, is a major factor. There is no change to our view on the long term attractiveness and US market size of Internet television, and no change to our view of the ultimate size of our US membership. We are forecasting Q4 US contribution margin to increase almost 500 basis points on a y/y basis, but to decrease slightly sequentially, as it did last year from Q3 to Q4, due to significant sequential increases in content and marketing expense. In September, we had a very successful launch in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, adding about 66 million1 broadband households to our addressable market. In recent days, our app has gone live on set-top boxes from SFR in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany, and 1 SNL Kagan 2we expect deployments this quarter from Orange and Bouygues in France, and Belgacom in Belgium. We’ve had more success, more quickly, with MVPD set-top boxes in these new markets than anywhere else in the world. As expected, we have a full quarter of new market expenses weighing on our international contribution margins in Q4, increasing contribution loss from Q3 to Q4. Our international markets launched prior to this year (Canada 4 years ago through Netherlands 1 year ago) are now collectively profitable on a contribution basis and will continue to help us fund new markets. Moreover, contribution margin from our first expansion market, Canada, now approximates the US. Starting in January, we have to pay higher VAT in most of Europe due to changes in European law (country of origin to country of destination). We will absorb these increases rather than pass them on to our members. This absorption will be reflected in slightly lower international contribution margin/profit starting in Q1 than we would otherwise have. Given how well our international expansion has performed, we intend substantial further expansion in 2015, consistent with our stated strategy. US contribution margin increases beyond 30% Our US contribution margin grew about 500 bps to 28.6% for Q3. After achieving 30% contribution margin, likely in Q1 or Q2 of next year, we will seek to grow margins an average of 200 basis points per year for the following years. Ideally, we will achieve 40% contribution margin five years after achieving 30%. This increase in our domestic contribution margin gives us room to increase content spending as we grow, as well as substantial domestic profitability. Content In Q3, we launched several new original series, documentaries and comedy specials, while ensuring future access to one of the most successful and globally appealing series of the North American fall TV season, Gotham. In our second year of qualification as a programmer, Netflix took home seven Emmy awards. Original Series BoJack Horseman marked our expansion into the popular adult animated comedy genre. In the past, we’ve licensed back seasons of already successful series like Archer, Futurama, and Bob’s Burgers. BoJack Horseman, starring Will Arnett, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris, drew more viewers in its first few weeks than any of these established network shows over a comparable period on Netflix, confirming for us the value of expanding into original series. TV Guide wrote that BoJack Horseman was the “funniest show of the fall” and we are now in production on season two for 2015. In Q3, we also launched a second season of Hemlock Grove and an original 4th and final season of The Killing. Both shows have been well received globally. We are now in pre-production of the final season 3of Hemlock Grove. We also premiered two acclaimed British series in North America, Happy Valley (in US and Canada) and Peaky Blinders (US only). We are looking forward to the December 12 release of our next major original series Marco Polo, an epic, cinematic tale of power, adventure and betrayal. We are currently in production on nine Netflix original series around the world and during the quarter announced a new comedy series, Love, from Judd Apatow, premiering in 2016. Original Documentary, Kids and Comedy Beyond scripted series, we launched three original documentaries in the quarter, Battered Bastards of Baseball, Mission Blue and Print the Legend. These documentaries have grown in audience reach and have positioned Netflix as a significant player in a category that attracts some of the most loyal and intense viewers. Finishing off the year, we will release E-Team, a powerful journalistic film from Oscar winning director Ross Kauffman and Katy Chevigny, and Virunga, a riveting film about the tensions over one of Africa’s best known national parks and the home of the mountain gorillas. Netflix continues to be a key destination for kids and families. We now offer members 75 kids series that are each delighting more than 2 million viewers on Netflix. More than a dozen of these series, many of them exclusive to Netflix, reach over 5 million viewers. During the quarter, we announced a partnership with Saban Brands to reboot the popular Popples animated series, with Rainbow Studios to extend their Winx Club stories and with storied producer Avi Arad and 41 Entertainment to produce a CGI film and series with a new take on the origin story of King Kong. In Q4, we will launch on Netflix the premiere episodes of two original series from DreamWorks Animation, the return of the beloved kids franchise Veggie Tales and All Hail King Julien, based on the popular character from Madagascar. Last week, Chelsea Handler’s Uganda Be Kidding Me Live arrived globally on Netflix to strong viewing and rave reviews. Next year, Chelsea will create four comedy documentaries for Netflix with her new take on the traditional talk show to follow in 2016. In Q3, Jim Jeffries brought his latest stand-up show to Netflix members, while this quarter, our members will enjoy new material from Chelsea Peretti (Brooklyn Nine Nine) , Bill Burr, Wyatt Cenac (The Daily Show) and the legendary Bill Cosby. Original Films On August 28, 2015, we will release our first Netflix original film, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend. A big budget continuation of the beloved 2000 Oscar-nominated film, it will debut simultaneously on select global IMAX screens and in Ultra HD 4k on Netflix, offering consumers the option to see this beautiful action film how and when they want. Separately, we announced plans to release only on Netflix four new Adam Sandler feature comedies, beginning in early 2016. Sandler is a true global movie star, grossing over $3 billion over the last twenty years, and generating huge viewing across all Netflix territories. We are investing in original films because doing so can be favorable economically compared to current Pay TV deals and is consistent with the desires of the global on- 4demand generation to enjoy new movies without having to wait for months after they debut in US theaters. Multi-territory Television Licensing In Q3, we secured second window rights from Warner Bros. Television for the Fox series Gotham in all current and planned Netflix territories. This historic deal will deliver the series to Netflix members soon after the broadcast completion of each season and ensures that Netflix will be the only subscription video service in these territories to offer the Batman origin series, commercial free and on demand in full season presentations. In our just launched territories in Europe, Netflix debuted as original series the Emmy-winning Fargo from MGM Television as well as From Dusk Till Dawn from El Rey and Penny Dreadful from CBS Television. These deals ensure our international members access to hit US television series without having to wait the months or years imposed by traditional TV models and should help to reduce piracy in those markets. Product Improved Laptop Streaming We are midway through switching to native HTML5 streaming for our laptop players, eliminating downloads (of Silverlight) and improving the consumer proposition with a smoother playback experience and longer battery life. This has been a successful four-year effort to get strong DRM integrated into the major browsers. Set-top Boxes Using the same techniques we developed to get on hundreds of different Blu-ray players and Smart TVs, we are now able to support a wide variety of MVPD set-top devices with an outstanding and updatable application. The Virgin/TiVo architecture was our first, which is a fairly modern system. We have since expanded to less high-end systems. Personal recommendations We have continued to improve our various recommendations systems, which match users to content based upon their preferences. We have rolled out a new visual search feature on the website and mobile platforms; it includes suggested viewing possibilities for searches that come up empty. 5Strong Net Neutrality We continue to focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, to prevent large ISPs from holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance in order to extract payments from us, other Internet content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent. We’ve increased awareness of this issue globally. Our efforts have helped generate a record breaking number of comments to the FCC in favor of net neutrality, while in Europe policymakers are beginning to focus on this issue. We will continue to advocate for the US government to block the merger of Comcast/TWC or, at the very least, prevent a combined entity from charging for interconnection. HBO Starting back in 2011 we started saying that HBO would be our primary long-term competitor, particularly for content. The competition will drive us both to be better. It was inevitable and sensible that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application. Many people will subscribe to both Netflix and HBO since we have different shows, so we think it is likely we both prosper as consumers move to Internet TV. DVD Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight about 6 million members, adding $89 million in contribution profit in Q3 and we anticipate close to the same in Q4. Operating Income Operating income nearly doubled y/y to $110 million despite our investment in international expansion. To support this expansion, we’ve invested in personnel growth in our corporate G&A functions which is the primary driver of both the y/y and sequential increase in G&A. Also contributing to the sequential increase was an increase in legal fees and one-time costs related to the launch of our new markets. 6Free Cash Flow & Content Obligations Historically, FCF tracked close to net income. As we’ve written previously, our increased use of cash for content, especially originals, will cause FCF to be materially less than net income, at least for the years ahead while we are increasing our investment in this area. In addition, in quarters like Q3 with big international territory launches, we have only a partial quarter of international content P&L expense but a full quarter of cash payments. We finished the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Our total streaming content obligations increased to $8.9 billion in the quarter from $7.7 billion at the end of Q2, which includes $3.6 billion on the balance sheet. The increase was driven by the multi-year commitments associated with our latest market launches in Europe and the continued expansion of our original programming, including our first original movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend. Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: July 2014, April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013, October 2012. Summary The overwhelming consumer benefits of Internet television, in terms of convenience, control, selection, and price, continue to expand our opportunity. 7\"),\n",

Internationally, our forecast was low, and actuals came in slightly ahead (18.28A versus 17.99F). To remind everyone, the quarterly forecast we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. On an absolute basis (as opposed to relative to forecast), US net adds are down compared to one year ago (1.9 million this Q4 versus 2.3 million for Q4 2013). In October, we judged the leading factor of the similar decline in Q3 y/y net adds to be our May price change. Since then, with additional research, we now think that the decline in y/y net adds would have largely taken place independent of the price change. We’ve found our growth in net adds is strongest in the lower income areas of the US, which would not be the case if there was material price sensitivity. Additionally, we implemented a similar price change in Mexico during Q4, and saw no detectable change in net additions. We think, instead, the reduction in y/y net additions is a natural progression in our large US market as we grow. We have built in flexibility to our business model in terms of how quickly we grow content and marketing spend, so we intend to keep US contribution margins growing even with lower membership growth. This year we plan to increase US contribution margins from 30% in Q1 to about 32% in Q1 2016 to about 34% in Q1 2017, etc. We’ll re-evaluate the margin progression model again in early 2020 when we hopefully achieve 40% contribution margins. It is increasingly clear that virtually all entertainment video will be Internet video in the future. We believe there is big growth ahead in the US market for Netflix, even if we may not get there in a straight line of 6 million annual net adds. We’ll continue to improve our content, our marketing and our service, to eventually achieve “must have” status in most households. Our international segment is growing very nicely with net adds of 2.43 million members in Q4, compared to 1.74 million a year ago. Our initial set of markets (Canada, Latin America, the UK, Ireland, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands) achieved contribution profitability in Q3 and continue to grow. Our launch in Q3 in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg went well and our new original content is particularly popular. With all of the additional new original content set to premiere in 2015, it will be a big year for us in France, Germany and our other recently launched markets. We’ve successfully built big demand for Netflix from Argentina to Finland, due in part to the overall shift from linear to Internet TV. In late Q1, we’ll be launching Netflix in Australia and New Zealand. There are numerous local competitors and a thirst for movies and TV shows from around the world. Later in the year, we’ll launch additional major countries, in keeping with our global strategy. 2Our international expansion strategy over the last few years has been to expand as fast as we can while staying profitable on a global basis. Progress has been so strong that we now believe we can complete our global expansion over the next two years, while staying profitable, which is earlier than we expected. We then intend to generate material global profits from 2017 onwards. We already offer Netflix in about 50 countries and have learned a great deal about the content people prefer, the marketing they respond to and how to best organize ourselves for steady improvement. Acceleration to 200 countries is largely made possible by the tremendous growth of the Internet in general, including on phones, tablets and smart TVs. We intend to stick to our core ad-free subscription model. As with our initial round of international expansion, we’ll get some things wrong and do our best to fix them quickly. For most countries we have a good idea of the best approach for Netflix to take. For China, we are still exploring options — all of them modest. We’ll learn a great deal if we can successfully operate a small service in China centered on our original and other globally-licensed content. That is our preference, for the next few years, if we are able to acquire the necessary permissions. It is advantageous for Netflix to become global in many ways. The big one is absolute size (faster to $10B in revenue) because that revenue allows us to develop and license more content for our members and improve our service. A second is being able to source great stories from around the world and deliver them to the world. A third is the efficiency and influence of being a unique global licensor that provides worldwide distribution. With the growth of the Internet over the next 20 years, there will be some amazing entertainment services available globally. We intend to be one of the leaders. Content Looking at our original content performance over the last few years, there have been so many impressive aspects: how this effort, begun in 2012, has improved perceptions of the Netflix brand; how we’ve had a good start with 45 Emmy, 10 Golden Globe and two Academy Award nominations and several wins in just two years; how success with one great creator leads to new opportunities for other projects; how producing around the world with incredibly diverse talent is working for us; how much we feel we are just scratching the surface. But there is one real shocker; last year our original content overall was some of our most efficient content. Our originals cost us less money, relative to our viewing metrics, than most of our licensed content, much of which is well known and created by the top studios. We will continue to grow the percentage of our content spending dedicated to originals for the next several years. This will mean more cash usage, which means more debt. We factor interest cost into our originals budget as we try to make each project more efficient and effective than studio content we’d otherwise be licensing. 3Marco Polo has struck a chord across all Netflix territories, generating substantial viewing over the holiday season. It has a 93% Audience rating from Rotten Tomatoes compared to 96% for House of Cards and 96% for Game of Thrones for their first seasons. They are all incredibly entertaining shows. We intend to debut a second season of Marco Polo in 2016. We are thrilled to offer exclusively the controversial comedy, The Interview, to our US and Canadian members beginning this Saturday, Jan. 24 - just thirty days after it debuted in theaters and pay-per-view. Our first original feature film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II: The Green Destiny, is now in post production and will debut on August 26 in all of our markets. We expect to open the film on select IMAX screens the same day as its release on Netflix. This year, we are launching 320 hours of original series (new and returning), films, documentaries and stand-up comedy specials, triple the amount of original programming Netflix released in 2014. In Q1, we are premiering Season Three of House of Cards, the new Tina Fey and Robert Carlock comedy The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt starring Ellie Kemper and Bloodline, an intense family thriller from the creators of Damages that stars Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, Norbert Leo Butz, Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard. Our original documentary Virunga just secured our second back-to-back Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature and What Happened, Miss Simone?, a look at the life of the legendary singer Nina Simone, will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this week and at the Berlin Film Festival in February. Beginning this quarter, and in current Netflix territories outside the US and Canada, Netflix will be the exclusive home of Better Call Saul, Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad prequel that focuses on attorney Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk). In many territories outside of the UK, we just premiered the second season of the critically acclaimed British drama, The Fall with Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. For an overall view of our original content slate and upcoming premiere dates, please click here Product We have continued to deliver a variety of algorithmic and data improvements that put better choices in front of members. We are also pioneering offering new high-quality video formats, delivering UHD-4K for House of Cards and Marco Polo. Soon we will be offering High Dynamic Range video (HDR) which captures and renders pictures with more realistic peak brightness in the highlights, and may be a more significant step forward in viewing pleasure than UHD-4K. We will start building our library to deliver in HDR as new TVs become available from several manufacturers this year. Having supported the vast majority of Smart TV devices with a Netflix app, we are now turning our attention to more operator devices and set-top boxes. Following our success with Virgin Media in the UK, we have added British Telecom and TalkTalk on the YouView STB in the UK, Deutsche Telecom STBs in Germany, Bouygues, SFR, and Orange STBs in France, Proximus in Belgium, and DISH STBs in the US. The BT and Orange partnerships include a new payment capability, similar to what we offer on AppleTV. 4Members can elect for BT/Orange to bill on our behalf and the appeal of a single bill seems to be attractive. Marketing Each quarter a greater percentage of our marketing dollars is spent promoting our exclusive content as we believe it is the best way to drive consumer demand for Netflix. Our biggest campaign in Q4 was for Marco Polo, which we launched globally in early December. Separately, our highly targeted campaign behind the Netflix original documentary Virunga is continuing into Q1 with its Oscar nomination. In Q4, we also executed more modest campaigns behind King Julien to spur family viewing over the holidays and shared a moment of Netflix love with our Airport commercial timed to Thanksgiving travel in the US. Looking forward, we are launching campaigns for The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Better Call Saul (internationally) and Season 3 of House of Cards. We were pleased last week on the release of the YouGov Brand Index showing US brands with the most positive buzz, with Netflix at #3, up from #12 in 2013 and another indicator of how our brand is continuing to build momentum. Strong Net Neutrality People around the world increasingly view Internet access as a necessary utility -- Finland even made fast Internet access a legal right. Recently President Obama echoed the same themes in his call for the FCC to take bold steps to be able to ensure a low-cost high-speed Internet. The support for strong net neutrality continues to grow. Competition There is no news yet on timing or price of HBO’s expansion of a direct-to-consumer model to the US. Their Nordics’ offer is priced about the same as Netflix but the content offering includes only HBO and other original series, and not the breadth of movie content HBO offers in the US. Verizon and Redbox shut down their Netflix streaming competitor after about one year of operation. CBS launched its CBS All Access streaming service which, like Hulu, has commercial interruptions. Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Yahoo are all increasing their original programming efforts. Shomi and CraveTV launched in Canada. In many of our international markets, we face competition from both stand alone OTT services (Clarovideo in Mexico, for instance) and ones associated with incumbent broadcasters (CanalPlay in France). In Australia we will face strong competition this year, and look forward to getting started later this quarter. Piracy continues to be one of our biggest competitors. This graph of Popcorn Time’s sharp rise relative to Netflix and HBO in the Netherlands, for example, is sobering. 5MVPDs around the world are moving as they can to on-demand cloud-DVR models. Dish and Sony are launching “Internet MVPD” services. In general, Internet TV is going mainstream, which both increases the size of the market and brings new competitors. It couldn’t be a more exciting time in our industry! DVD Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight 5.8 million members, adding $89 million in contribution profit in Q4. The comprehensive selection of titles available on DVD and Blu-ray includes new release films, major TV shows (including HBO and Showtime series) and much more. Global Expenses, Income & Tax Rate On a pro-forma basis (without the tax reserve release described below) net income would have been $45 million, compared to a forecast of $27 million, due to lower than expected international losses and tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the 2014 R&D tax credit (independent of the tax reserve release). Our global technology and general and administrative costs increased year on year in support of continued international and content expansion. Our Q1 guidance reflects a sequential increase in these costs primarily related to adjustments in annual market compensation. In Q4, we resolved certain prior year tax audits, primarily related to R&D tax credits, resulting in the release of $39 million in reserves from the prior open tax periods. We also expect a favorable effect on our future effective tax rate of around 2% due to a lowered reserve rate on the R&D credit going forward. Because of our international expansion plans for 2015, we expect full year operating income for 2015 to be lower than full year 2014. Free Cash Flow & Capital We finished the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents. Given we are investing faster in content (this Q1 will show a step up in cash use with all the original projects launching in the quarter) and the current favorable interest rate environment, we intend to raise at least a billion dollars, pending market conditions, of additional long-term debt in a similar manner to last year. Over the next few years we expect to continue financing our original content expansion with long-term debt. As long as the maturities are spread out, and the interest cost is built into our content budgets, we think long-term debt is the best way for Netflix to finance the production of content. 6Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2014, July 2014, April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013. Summary Congratulations to Kevin Spacey for winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series for House of Cards. We hope you are all looking forward to the February 27 premiere of season three of House of Cards. It’s the most entertaining season yet.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves provides useful information as these measures exclude benefits that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance, US contribution margin and domestic performance, spending on original content, global expansion and profitability, product improvements, operating expenses, cash flow and debt financing, member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in- home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could 8cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In the US, we gained 2.3 million new members, well above our expectation of 1.8 million due to both acquiring and retaining more members than forecast. Internationally, we added 2.6 million members versus a forecast of 2.25 million due to stronger growth than expected across a number of markets. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We think strong US growth benefited from our ever-improving content, including the launch of the third season of House of Cards and new shows Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Bloodline. In addition, retention continued to improve due to the growing value of our service overall. We are forecasting Q2 US net adds of 0.6 million, similar to the year ago quarter. During Q1, higher-than-forecast net adds and US revenue, coupled with lower-than-forecast content spending, resulted in a US contribution margin of 31.7%, ahead of our 30.1% estimate. In 2015, we expect to run ahead of our US contribution margin growth target of 200 bps/year on average because a greater share of global and original content costs will be absorbed by existing and new international territories as we continue to expand globally (since we allocate global content costs by geography). In addition, starting in Q2 we intend to shift some of our US marketing budget to international to take advantage of the substantial available growth opportunities. This, in the short term, drives down international contribution profits and drives up US contribution profits. We are still targeting 40% contribution margin in the US in 2020. Our international segment was fueled by continued strong growth across our 50+ countries as well as a successful March 24 launch in Australia and New Zealand, which adds about 8 million1 broadband households to our addressable market. In ANZ, Netflix benefited from high consumer awareness, a fervent fan base for original series like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and operator relationships with Optus and iiNet, the second and third largest broadband providers. We expect international Q2 net adds of 1.90 million, up 70% vs. last year. Later in 2015, we will launch additional markets, starting with Japan. The strong dollar hurt financial results during the quarter, negatively affecting International segment revenue (lower by $48 million y/y using Q1 2014 forex rates) which carried through into a $15M negative forex impact on international contribution loss. These forex headwinds offset better than expected subscriber growth to result in contribution losses close to our expectations. As a reminder, we absorbed on average 5% higher VAT rates across our European markets starting January 1. We’ll have a full quarter of content expenses in ANZ in Q2 and expect the international segment loss to grow to $101 million, increasing throughout the back half of 2015 as we expand to additional markets (consistent with what we’ve said). Our strong performance led to overall operating income that exceeded our projections ($97m actual versus $79m forecast). Net income was negatively affected by currency-related transaction losses 1 SNL Kagan 2included in other expense; excluding these forex losses, Q1 EPS would have been $0.77 vs. our $0.60 forecast and our actual EPS of $0.38. Content Our original content strategy is playing out as we hoped, driving lots of viewing in an economic way for Netflix while bolstering the positive perception of our brand and service around the world. House of Cards, in its third season, had its biggest launch yet in terms of viewers. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Tina Fey’s return to television, has been a hit, winning Rotten Tomatoes scores of 90%+ from both critics and viewers and our drama thriller, Bloodline starring Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn and Sissy Spacek, is performing on par with the first seasons of our other big drama shows. During the quarter, we announced new seasons for all three shows, as well as three new Netflix original films, Pee- Wee’s Big Holiday from Judd Apatow and Paul Reubens, Jadotville, from Irish director Richie Smyth and starring Jamie Dornan, and Beasts of No Nation from director Cary Fukunaga and starring Idris Elba. Beasts will premiere on Netflix later this year. We are delighted by the fan excitement and critical response around last Friday’s launch of Marvel’s Daredevil, the first of four series and a mini-series from our deal with Marvel Entertainment. The current quarter will also see the debut of Grace and Frankie starring legendary comedians Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, Sense8, an unbelievably cinematic and entertaining global dramatic thriller from the Wachowski siblings, and the third season of our groundbreaking Orange is The New Black. To track our future originals slate, click here. Marketing We are increasingly spending on the promotion of our original content rather than emphasizing attributes of the Netflix brand and service that are now more familiar to consumers. Early tests in international markets suggest this content focus is aiding member acquisition. We are also spending a bigger proportion of our marketing dollars online. This allows us to more finely target audiences and to deliver the right marketing message to the right person at the right time, particularly on mobile devices. Product We plan to roll out an improvement to our TV UI in the second half of 2015. The enhancement will bring video playback forward into the browse experience. We are also developing improved ways to promote Netflix originals to our members, using our data to help identify which members would be most likely to enjoy each original title. Given our international rollout, we continue to add subtitles and UI languages for much of our content. Over the next year we’ll evolve from using HTTP to using Secure HTTP (HTTPS) while browsing and viewing content on our service. This helps protect member privacy, particularly when the network is insecure, such as public wifi, and it helps protect members from eavesdropping by their ISP or employer, who may want to record our members’ viewing for other reasons. 3Strong Net Neutrality We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points. In the US, we have been vocal advocates for, and are pleased with, recent action by the FCC to assure an open and neutral Internet under its Title II authority. In particular, we applaud the FCC for specifically addressing interconnection points. We hope this action serves as an example to regulators around the world looking to strengthen the innovative force of the Internet. Data caps inhibit Internet innovation and are bad for consumers. In Australia, we recently sought to protect our new members from data caps by participating in ISP programs that, while common in Australia, effectively condone discrimination among video services (some capped, some not). We should have avoided that and will avoid it going forward. Fortunately, most fixed-line ISPs are raising or eliminating data caps in line with our belief that ISPs should provide great video for all services in a market and let consumers do the choosing. Competition In the US, HBO began offering its $15 per month “HBO Now” service last week. As we have said in the past, Netflix and HBO are not substitutes for one another given differing content. We think both will continue to be successful in the marketplace, as illustrated by the fact that HBO has continued to grow globally and domestically as we have rapidly grown over the past 5 years. We view “Internet MVPD” offerings like the rumored Apple offering, Sony’s Playstation Vue and Dish’s Sling TV as more competitive to the current pay TV bundle than to Netflix which is lower cost, has exclusive and original content, and is not focused on live television. Piracy remains a considerable long-term threat, mostly outside the US. DVD Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to delight more than 5.5 million members and provided $85 million in contribution profit in Q1. The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and TV shows, remains appealing to a core user base and means that the tail on this business should be quite long. Free Cash Flow & Capital During the quarter, free cash flow totaled -$163 million, a step up from Q4 reflecting our growing original content investment. In February, we issued $1.5 billion in debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%, split between 7 and 10 year notes. We ended Q1 with $3.0 billion in cash & equivalents and short term investments. We will continue to invest aggressively in original content which is cash intensive. As we’ve said, our plan is to run around break-even globally through 2016, and to then deliver material global profits in 2017 and beyond. 4Stock Split As highlighted in our preliminary proxy, we are seeking shareholder approval for an increase in our authorized shares. If approved, we expect to recommend to our Board a stock split to make our stock more accessible. Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: January 2015, October 2014, July 2014, April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013. Summary We are excited to see Internet TV catch hold across the world. We are at one of those wonderful moments when technology intersects with storytelling to create more choice and value for consumers. It’s great to be at the vanguard and we appreciate your support.

       "  \"In Q2, we eclipsed 65 million members, with over 42 million in the US and 23 million internationally. We are at the forefront of a wave of global Internet TV adoption and intend to make our service available throughout the world by the end of 2016. Our summary results and Q3 forecast are below. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast We added a Q2 record 3.3 million new streaming members, compared to 1.7 million in the previous year quarter. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we clearly under-forecast in Q2 (forecast was 2.5 million net adds). We strive for accuracy in the forecast and our Q3 estimates are based on everything we know up to today. We gained 0.9 million members in the US and added 2.4 million members internationally in Q2. We believe the higher than anticipated level of acquisition was fueled by the growing strength of our original programming slate, which in Q2 included the first seasons of Marvel’s Daredevil, Sense8, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Dragons: Race to the Edge and Grace and Frankie as well as season 3 of Orange is the New Black. US \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b revenue growth was also driven by a 5% year over year increase in ASP due to uptake in our HD 2-stream plan. We continue to target a 40% US contribution margin by 2020, even though we are running ahead of plan given stronger than expected top line performance and lower content and other streaming costs. We are forecasting Q3 US net adds of 1.15 million, slightly higher than the year ago period. Our international segment is growing at a rapid pace. We did not add additional markets in Q2 but saw continued improvement across existing markets, including a full quarter of additions from our successful March 24, 2015 launch in Australia/New Zealand. We project Q3 international net adds of 2.4 million. International revenue grew 48% year over year, despite an -$83 million impact from currency (+5% ASP growth x-F/X). As we expected, international losses increased sequentially with a full quarter of operating costs in AU/NZ. We expect this trend to continue in the second half as we launch additional markets (Japan in Q3 and Spain, Italy and Portugal in Q4) and prepare for further global expansion in 2016, including China as we continue to explore options there. EPS for Q2 amounted to $0.06 after adjustment for our 7-for-1 stock split (EPS would have been $0.42 using pre-split share count). We remain committed to running around break-even globally on a net income basis through 2016, and to then deliver material global profits in 2017 and beyond. Content We are making great progress shifting to exclusive content and expanding our original content, which differentiates our service, drives enjoyment for existing members and helps motivate consumers to join Netflix. In Q2, we launched our largest number to date of high profile Netflix original series. On April 10, Marvel’s Daredevil debuted to strong audience engagement, particularly for a new show. Grace and \\u200b \\u200b Frankie, the bittersweet comedy starring Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda which launched on May 8, also has \\u200b found a broad and appreciative audience around the world. Both series have already begun their second season of production. 2Our global expansion extends to our content strategy as well. Sense8, the mind-bending cinematic \\u200b \\u200b thriller from the Wachowski siblings and J. Michael Straczynski that debuted June 5, is an ambitious, truly international show with talent behind and in front of the camera from multiple countries. Similarly, on August 7, we will launch in all territories our first non-English language original, Club de \\u200b Cuervos, a family comedy set in the world of futbol from Mexican filmmaker Gaz Alazraki, and on August \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 28, Narcos, a gripping account of the roots of the cocaine trade, shot in Colombia and starring the great \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b\\u200b Brazilian star Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. The original documentary Chef’s Table and our latest DreamWorks Animation series Dragons: Race to \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b the Edge are among our most viewed new originals to date. They are the perfect example of what we \\u200b strive for in our original programming; an elevated version of popular genres that reach a large audience globally. We closed the quarter with season 3 of Orange is the New Black, which went live on June 11 and set off \\u200b \\u200b a social media shockwave around the world. On the following Sunday, Netflix members globally watched a record number of hours in a single day, led by Orange, despite the season finale of HBO’s Game of \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Thrones and game five of the NBA finals also falling on that Sunday. Global enthusiasm for the third \\u200b season of Orange underlines our ability to create franchise properties that bring new members to Netflix \\u200b \\u200b as well as delighting current ones. Nearly ninety percent of Netflix members have engaged with Netflix original content, another indicator that we are on the right path. We anticipate that as our global content spend approaches $5 billion in 2016 on a P&L basis (over $6 billion cash), we will devote more investment to originals both in absolute dollars and percentage terms. This includes not only series, documentaries and stand-up but also original feature films. We are moving into the original film business in order to have new, high-quality movies that our global members can find only on Netflix. As with series, we’ve chosen to take a portfolio approach covering a wide variety of genres and based around creators with great track records and stories they are passionate about. The first of our films, Beasts of No Nation, a gripping war drama from the \\u200b \\u200b award-winning director Cary Fukunaga (True Detective) and starring award-winning Idris Elba (Mandela, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Luther, The Wire) will be available to all Netflix members and in select theaters in October. In June, we \\u200b announced War Machine, a provocative satirical comedy starring Brad Pitt, which will be exclusively \\u200b \\u200b available to Netflix members and in select theaters next year. The release schedule for our slate of original films can be found here. \\u200b \\u200b Product In June, we unveiled the new Netflix website, our first major update in over four years. The new \\u200b experience has been built from the ground up to make it faster and easier for our members to discover great content to watch. The UI is a richer and more visual experience with improved title art and a better details view. It also works more like an app and less like a series of linked web pages. Early feedback has been positive from both members and the media, and retention should benefit. 3In support of expanding our service globally, we are focused on adding more languages, optimizing our personalization algorithms for a global library in local markets, and expanding support for a range of device, operator and payment partnerships. We are also placing a greater emphasis on optimizing for mobile, which is the main means for Internet access in many emerging markets where we will be expanding in the future. Strong Net Neutrality Charter Communications made net neutrality history today by committing to open and free interconnection across the Charter/TWC network, if their pending merger is approved. This move ensures that all online video providers can aggressively compete for consumers' favor, without selective and increasing fees paid to ISPs. Charter's interconnection policy is the right way to scale the Internet. It means consumer will receive the fast connection speeds they expect. The Charter/TWC transaction, with this condition, would deliver significant public interest benefits to broadband consumers, and we urge its timely approval. Competition We compete with linear TV, PPV, video piracy, other Internet networks, video gaming and many other sources of entertainment. The recent Sandvine results from North America show that, looking at just the Internet networks segment, we continue to improve faster than others. Note that this data measures peak megabits, not peak viewing hours, so YouTube, for example, with more modest average video quality, is underrepresented in terms of hours. 4DVD Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve 5.3 million members and provided $77.9 million in contribution profit in Q2. The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and TV shows, remains appealing to a core user base and means that the tail on this business should be quite long. Free Cash Flow & Capital Free cash flow in Q2 amounted to -$229 million, compared with -$163 million in Q1. As we have previously detailed, our investment in originals is working capital intensive, which results in higher cash spent upfront relative to content amortization, and, we anticipate this trend to continue given our increased investment in originals. At the end of Q2, gross debt totaled $2.4 billion, which represented 4.6x LTM EBITDA and we ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash & equivalents and short term investments. Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: April 2015, January 2015, October 2014, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b July 2014, April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Summary We’re pleased to see the growing momentum of our original programming driving strong growth in the US and abroad. With our first set of international markets having achieved contribution profitability, we’ll be making our first foray into Asia this Fall with our Japan launch, and are gearing up to offer our service around the globe.

       " ('FINAL-Q3-15-Shareholder-Letter',\n",
       "  'We have grown to over 69 million members around the world and expect to end this year with over 74 million members. With a successful launch in Japan, and our launches next week in Spain, Italy and Portugal, we remain on track to become global by the end of 2016. Our summary results and forecast for Q4 are below. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Global membership grew 3.62 million to 69.17 million members compared to prior year growth of 3.02 million, and a forecast of 3.55 million. Operating income was $74 million, compared to prior year of $110 million and a forecast of $81 million. Seven quarters ago we moved to providing you our internal forecast for the quarter ahead. We strive for accuracy in this projection and, when it comes to global net additions, Q3 was our most accurate to date: we were within 2% (3.62 vs. 3.55) and within 10% on operating income ($74m vs. $81m). While global growth was as we expected, our forecast was high for the US and low for international. We added 0.88 million new US members in the quarter compared to 0.98 million prior year and a forecast of 1.15 million. Our over-forecast in the US for Q3 was due to slightly higher-than-expected involuntary churn (inability to collect), which we believe was driven in part by the ongoing transition to chip-based credit and debit cards. In terms of US net additions, through the first nine months of 2015, we are slightly ahead of prior year, and we expect to finish 2015 at about 2014 levels. This would mark the 4th consecutive year we’ve added about 6 million members in the US. Our US contribution margin in Q3 expanded 375 basis points year over year to 32.4%. This was inclusive of an acceleration in the amortization of some of our licensed content, similar to how we already treat originals and reflecting more viewing in the first month. The effect of this change was a $13 million decrease in US streaming contribution profit in Q3. For Q4, we anticipate 1.65 million US net adds and US contribution margin of 34.0% vs. 28.0% in the year ago quarter. We continue to target a 40% US contribution margin by 2020. International net add growth totaled 2.74 million compared to 2.04 million in the prior year and a 2.40 million forecast. Excluding the impact of foreign currency ($96 million on a year over year basis), international ASP improved 6% vs. Q3 ‘14, helped by plan mix. In August, we raised our high-definition 2-screen monthly price plan in Europe by one Euro without negatively impacting growth. As we have indicated previously, international contribution losses will grow sequentially in Q4 as we launch Spain, Italy and Portugal. We have announced our expansion to South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore in early 2016. Our plan remains to run around break-even through 2016 and to deliver material profits thereafter. Last week we increased prices in several countries including the US, to improve our ability to acquire and offer high quality content, which is the number one member request. Our US pricing is now $7.99 for our standard-definition 1-screen-at-a-time plan (unchanged), $9.99 for our high-definition 2-screen plan (up $1), and $11.99 for ultra-high-definition 4-screen plan (unchanged). Members who were paying $8.99 for the high-definition plan are grandfathered at that price for one year. 2Content As our membership expands, we are quickly becoming a global distribution platform for creators worldwide. Narcos, our latest original series, is a hit and is another fine example of a Netflix original - \\u200b \\u200b embraced by both critics and audiences and global in nature (bilingual, Brazilian director and star, US \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and Latin American cast, shot in Colombia) with substantial viewing across all our territories. This past quarter, we also unveiled our first locally-produced original series, Club de Cuervos, which \\u200b \\u200b played strongly not just in its home country of Mexico but with Spanish speakers around the world, including the US. We are currently in production on our second Mexican original series, Ingobernable, \\u200b \\u200b starring Latin American TV superstar, Kate del Castillo, and the French produced Marseille. We have \\u200b \\u200b also announced original series productions in Brazil and Italy. \\u200b \\u200b We will launch our first original feature film Beasts of No Nation on Netflix on October 16. This gripping \\u200b \\u200b war drama featuring Idris Elba and Abraham Attah has received universal critical acclaim and is an early \\u200b \\u200b Oscar hopeful. Attah won the prestigious Marcello Mastroianni Award at the Venice Film Festival \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b recognizing him as the best newcomer. We’re also excited to release the first of four films from Adam Sandler, The Ridiculous Six, in December. This release comes on the heels of Sandler’s global success \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b with Pixels ($240M worldwide box office) and the currently hot Hotel Transylvania 2 (already grossing \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b over $200M worldwide box office and yet to be released in many of the larger foreign markets). \\u200b Just three years into our originals strategy, we have come a long way and our content is increasingly recognized for its quality and breadth. This year, we garnered a Netflix-record 34 Emmy nominations, across 11 of our original series and documentaries and won four. Netflix and HBO were the only networks to have 3 shows competing for best series honors this year. HBO had an amazing year at the Emmys, but we have only just begun. In addition, Common Sense Media recently named 6 of our original series among the 25 best shows on TV for families with kids from age 2-17. \\u200b \\u200b It is clear that Internet TV is becoming increasingly mainstream and traditional media companies are adjusting to the shift from linear to on-demand viewing. It is a great time to be a creator of content because studios make content to sell content (not to withhold it) and there are new bidders for their product. Some studios will choose to license content to SVOD services like Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix. Others may not. We have a lot of content to select from. We recently announced that we have acquired global second window rights to four major series. These are How to Get Away with Murder, ABC’s highest rated new series from the 2014/2015 TV season, the \\u200b \\u200b eagerly anticipated Colony from Legendary Television and Universal Cable Productions and, from CBS, \\u200b \\u200b Zoo, the most-watched scripted summer series of 2015 and the critically acclaimed, Emmy nominated \\u200b and Golden Globe winning Jane the Virgin. These deals will ensure that audiences around the world will \\u200b \\u200b have access to these exciting series on Netflix. 3Last month, we did not renew our deal to carry movies from EPIX, as the films were non-exclusive, US-only and offered in windows even further behind other premium Pay TV outlets. So far, we’ve seen no material reduction in US feature film viewing as we have so many other films for members to enjoy. We are investing in high profile, exclusive and globally available original films and creating the first-of-their-kind global Pay TV deals directly with producers. In some cases, we are making the films available globally after a 30 day theatrical and VOD window or in the case of the upcoming New Regency film The Big Short, with Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell, we will offer the film \\u200b \\u200b globally in a more traditional Pay TV window several months after theatrical and transactional VOD, in all territories excluding France. Product In September, we expanded our in-app purchase relationship with Apple by extending our partnership from Apple TV to iPhone and iPad. Now, new members around the world can sign up for Netflix in-app on the iPhone and iPad, creating a more seamless user experience. We recently announced a partnership with Virgin America, where new and existing members are able to stream the full Netflix service to their personal devices (at no additional cost) at 35,000 feet in the sky on newly upgraded Virgin America aircraft. Partnerships like this advance our goal to bring Netflix streaming to members wherever they are and whenever they want. Competition The competitive landscape remains vibrant as Netflix competes with many forms of entertainment for consumers’ leisure time. Other SVOD services continue to evolve: Hulu now offers a commercial free option at $11.99 per month, HBO GO is expanding into Latin America, and the press reported that Amazon Prime spent about $250 million on the new Jeremy Clarkson show. They remain active bidders for content, in addition to all the cable networks around the world. As we have written in our Long-Term View, linear networks that embrace on demand and Internet \\u200b \\u200b delivery as we have, will become more valuable and will experience renewed growth (like HBO Now), while those that do not will lose relevancy. The secular shift to on-demand consumption is best described as “consumers evolving vs. old habits” rather than “Netflix vs. traditional media.” We’re all racing to fulfill consumer desires. DVD Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve and please over 5 million members, providing us with $80 million in contribution profit in Q3 (down 11% Y/Y). The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and TV shows, remains attractive to a core member base and means that the tail on this business should be quite long. 4Free Cash Flow and Capital Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$252 million, down from -$229 million in Q2, due to the working capital intensity of our investment in originals, which results in higher cash spent upfront relative to content amortization. Investing in originals remains the right strategy for Netflix. Exclusive first-window “only on Netflix” content differentiates our service, allows us to leverage our global platform, reduces our dependence on third parties, and adds positive brand halo. Moreover, as more of our content spend is devoted to producing and owning our originals, we are building long term library value. At the end of Q3, gross debt totaled $2.4 billion, which represents a debt to total cap ratio of about 5%, and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash & equivalents and short term investments. We are likely to raise additional capital next year to fund our continued content investments.

       "  'On January 1st, just a few hours after the quarter closed, we crossed 75 million members. Our quarter-end 74.76 million members put us at over 17 million net additions for the year, showing how much the world is embracing Internet TV. We think we’ll grow by over 6 million members in Q1 given our expansion of Netflix to virtually everywhere but China. We bring great stories from all over the world to people all over the world. Our summary results and Q1 forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast In the fourth quarter, we added a record 5.59 million members as our big shows such as Narcos and \\u200b \\u200b Marvel’s Jessica Jones helped us grow membership to 74.76 million. This 5.59 million compares to a \\u200b forecast of 5.15 million and to prior year net additions of 4.33 million. For Q1, we are forecasting 6.10 million net additions vs. prior year of 4.88 million. On earnings, we stayed profitable in Q4 despite foreign exchange headwinds, and delivered operating income of $60m and net income of $43m. We expect similar modest operating income results for Q1, assuming current foreign exchange, as we invest in our international expansion. As a reminder, the guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report, and we strive for accuracy in our guidance. In September, we launched in Japan, followed by Spain, Portugal and Italy in October. We are very pleased with the first few months of membership growth in these markets. Our international contribution loss of $109 million in Q4 increased sequentially due to these launches. We anticipate Q1 international losses of about $114 million. In early January at CES, we announced the availability of Netflix everywhere in the world except China. Pricing is comparable to our existing plans and we have added support for Korean, Arabic, and Simplified & Traditional Chinese languages. Our move into 130 additional countries broadens our addressable market by 190 million broadband homes, on top of the 360 million we counted at the end of 20151. While the opportunity is large, our growth in these new markets will unfold over many years as we improve our service. We are starting by primarily targeting outward-looking, affluent consumers with international credit cards and smartphones. As with every market we’ve launched, our approach is to listen, learn and improve rapidly, adding more content, additional languages and a better Netflix experience over time. Our global availability sets us up for continued growth for many years and we continue to expect material global profits beginning in 2017. In Q4, average subscriber price grew 4-5% y/y around the world, excluding the impact of foreign currency (-$106 million y/y impact on revenue). In the US it was 4.3%, leading to 21% year over year growth in streaming revenue. We are seeing increased adoption of our Ultra-HD plan ($11.99) as more UHD TVs are purchased and as we are a leading source of UHD content for consumers. In the US, we ended 2015 with nearly 45 million members, although our Q4 US net adds were down year over year, as expected (1.56m actual versus 1.90m prior year). Our high penetration in the US seems to be making net additions harder than in the past. Our forecast for Q1 US net additions is 1.75m, against a prior year actual of 2.28m. New credit/debit card rollover continues to be a background issue. In Q2 and Q3, we’ll be releasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering on the HD plan and they will have the option of continuing at $7.99 but now on the SD plan, or continuing on HD at $9.99 a month. Given these members have been with us at least 2 years, we expect only slightly elevated churn. Our 2020 US contribution target remains at 40% and we are already at 34%. 1 Source: SNL Kagan and Euromonitor. 2In the last remaining major market, China, we have work and uncertainty ahead. We are building relationships, understanding the market, and seeking the conditions we require to provide our service to entertainment lovers there. Our expectations are modest and long-term. We may be able to get started this year and thus deliver on “whole world by end of 2016” or it may take longer. Most of our focus is on the 130 countries we launched on January 6, which are now embracing Netflix as a new entertainment option. Content In Q4 ‘15, we launched an unprecedented number of original series and films, while maintaining a high bar on quality. We unveiled five new original series in Q4, including Marvel’s Jessica Jones and Master of \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b None, starring Aziz Ansari. Both combined with Narcos, Sense8, Marvel’s Daredevil and Bloodline to \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b claim six of the Top 10 new TV shows of 2015 according to IMDB. In late December, we debuted a \\u200b \\u200b ten-part documentary series Making a Murderer, which has enthralled audiences and critics alike and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b triggered a national conversation on fairness of the American criminal justice system. \\u200b \\u200b Our first original feature films also premiered in Q4. Beasts of No Nation, a gripping journey into the \\u200b \\u200b world of African child soldiers from writer and director Cary Fukunaga and starring Idris Elba, was a favorite of critics and has picked up several major awards nominations. Adam Sandler’s first Netflix original film The Ridiculous Six, which debuted globally on December 11, was the most viewed movie on \\u200b \\u200b Netflix in every territory the week of its debut and the most-viewed movie ever on Netflix in the first 30 days on service. Two of our original documentaries, What Happened, Miss Simone? and Winter on Fire, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b are both nominated for Academy Awards, our third and fourth nominations in three years for best documentary feature. In 2016, we plan to launch over 600 hours of original programming, up from about 450 hours in 2015. Beyond the sheer volume of content, the breadth of our original programming will continue to expand with current plans for new seasons of 30 or so original series (including The Crown and The Get Down), \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b eight original feature films, 35 new seasons of original series for kids, a dozen documentaries, and nine stand up comedy specials. We are now in our fourth year of original programming and we are putting special emphasis on shows that families can enjoy together, including the upcoming Fuller House, new seasons of Unbreakable \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Kimmy Schmidt, and Stranger Things. We are also stepping up our non-English language original \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b productions, including Marseille, a French political drama starring Gerard Depardieu, and then, shows \\u200b \\u200b from Italy, Japan, Mexico and Brazil. We expect some of these series to gain fans well beyond the markets in which they were made. Increasingly, our goal is to own more of our original programming to allow for greater creative and business control and to ensure global access to content. We are currently actively managing productions spanning the globe from Cambodia to Venice Beach. 3The growth of Netflix has created some anxiety among TV networks and calls to be fearful. Or, at the \\u200b \\u200b other extreme, an NBC executive recently said Internet TV is overblown and that linear TV is “TV like God \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b intended.” Our investors are not as sure of God’s intentions for TV, and instead think that Internet TV is \\u200b a fundamentally better entertainment experience that will gain share for many years. The challenge for traditional media companies, most of whom see the future pretty clearly, is to use the revenue from Netflix and other SVOD services to fund both great content and their own evolution into Internet TV networks. Seeso, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, CanalPlay, HBO Now, and CBS All Access are the beginnings of these efforts. Our titles are watched on the go and at home on a wide range of devices, making measurement of the viewing of any given title difficult for third parties. We don’t release title-level ratings as our business model is not dependent on advertising or affiliate fees. Instead, we release “ratings “ for Netflix as a whole every quarter with our membership growth report (75 million and counting!). It is member viewing and satisfaction that propels our growth. Product We have been innovating in support of our global launch, focusing on adding new languages, new payment options and fine-tuning our algorithms for our growing number of content catalogs. Additionally, this involves expanding and deepening our partnerships with device makers and mobile and TV operators to reach and serve our members around the world. We recognize that in some parts of the world, mobile is the primary way many people access the Internet. We are improving our mobile experience, including sign up, credentials & authentication, the user interface, and streaming efficiency for cellular networks. In Q4, we began rolling out complexity based encoding. By encoding videos based on the type of content \\u200b \\u200b (a visually complex action movie vs. a simpler kids animated title, for example) rather than just based on the amount of bandwidth available to a member, we can deliver higher resolution streams at lower bit rates, resulting in bandwidth savings. We have long used a blacklist to prevent cross-border content viewing via proxies and “unblockers.” Recently, we have begun to use a new blacklist and other techniques, as are other SVOD services, as desired by content licensors. Ultimately, our goal is to let members around the world enjoy all the content we have through global licensing. Marketing Promoting high quality, exclusive titles continues to be the best driver of consumer demand for Netflix. Our recent new market launches reflect this philosophy, and our all-digital, content-led marketing approach is working. Our brand strength is rising in many studies, including a #2 ranking reported in \\u200b \\u200b AdWeek for the USA. Around the world, our all digital approach makes us efficient and relevant to active \\u200b Internet users everywhere. 4Competition Our focus on “winning moments of truth” means that we compete with all of the activities that consumers can engage in during their leisure time, such as reading a book, playing videogames, watching linear TV, movie theatre-going, etc. Given the broad array of options, we are privileged that our members around the world continue to devote more time to Netflix, streaming 42.5 billion hours in 2015, up from 29 billion hours in 2014. In addition, looking at just the online segment, the most recent Sandvine data illustrates that our share of peak North American downstream Internet traffic continues to grow. Please note that the deployment of complexity based encoding, as described above, will result in what appears to be slower growth in Netflix traffic in future third-party reports such as Sandvine (which measures peak megabits, not peak viewing hours). As we have said previously, Internet TV will likely have multiple winners as the various services are not direct substitutes for each other given differing sets of content. A closer look at the Sandvine data shows that the entire Over-the-Top category is growing as consumers increasingly embrace Internet TV and on demand viewing and, even better, this growth is coming at the expense of piracy. 5Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow amounted to -$276 million in Q4 and -$921 million for the full year 2015. As a reminder, our investment in originals, particularly owned content, requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content, which will continue to dampen free cash flow. We finished Q4 with debt of $2.4 billion, unchanged from the prior quarter, and with cash & equivalents and short-term investments of $2.3 billion. Given our expected cash needs, we are likely to raise additional debt in late 2016 or early 2017. We are managing our balance sheet to lower our blended cost of capital over time, while maintaining financial flexibility. Despite being FCF negative as we grow our original content and invest in international, our bonds trade like a BB credit (vs. their single B rating) due, in part, to the long-term growth of Internet TV globally and our low debt to market cap ratio, which provides bond investors with a very thick cushion of protection. DVD Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve more than 4.9 million members. We are pleased that our DVD business is managing the decline well, despite increasing postal costs, generating $80 million in contribution profit in Q4.

       "  'We are off to a great start in 2016, expanding the Netflix service to 130 new countries in January and finishing Q1 with over 81 million members on the strength of our fast growing slate of original content. Since 2010, we have offered unlimited streaming for $7.99 per month in the US, and we hope to maintain this affordable entry-price for a long time. As we’ve made vast improvements in our service and content, consumers see even more value and our membership grows. Q1 was no exception and our summary results are below. Q1 Results Net additions in Q1 ‘16 amounted to a record 6.74 million, surpassing our prior high water mark of 5.59 million in Q4 ‘15 and against 4.88 million in the year-ago period. Of our 81.5 million members, 42% are now outside of the US. Operating income was $49 million vs. $97 million in the year ago quarter, as we continue to invest in international markets. Performance in the quarter benefited from the launch of several series, including Making a Murderer (a \\u200b \\u200b late December debut), Fuller House (February), House of Cards Season 4 (March) and Daredevil Season 2 \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b (March), complemented by a diverse mix of new films, documentaries, series and kids shows available globally. In the US, we added 2.23 million members in Q1, against 2.28 million a year ago, and 2.25 two years ago. Our forecast for the quarter was low (at 1.75 million) because we underestimated the positive acquisition impact of our major original content debuts. US revenue rose 18% year-over-year, reflecting 14% growth in average paid memberships and a 3% increase in ARPU. US contribution profit totaled $413 million, or a 35.5% margin, compared to 31.7% a year ago. International revenue increased 57% year-over-year, including the negative impact of currency (-$82 million on a y/y basis). Excluding F/X, international ARPU rose 7% year-over-year. Our Q1 international contribution loss of $104 million came in better than forecast due to the timing of content spend. Our established markets around the world are all growing, and in early Q1 we added 130 more countries. By expanding broadly at once, we are learning more quickly about how best to please consumers across a wide variety of cultures and markets. In most of these markets, so far, Netflix is offered only in English and payment methods are limited primarily to international credit cards. In the coming quarters, we will add more local languages, content, payment options and customer support. We are pleased Netflix is finding acceptance around the world. Consumers worldwide are delighted to be able to enjoy our original and exclusive series and films instantaneously. We have lots of work to do to make Netflix more relevant market by market, but the opportunity is amazing. Q2 Forecast As a reminder, the guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For the second quarter, we expect to add 2.5 million members with 0.5 million in the US and 2.0 million internationally (versus prior year 2.4 million). In the US, our Q2 net adds forecast of 0.5 million is in-line with prior years (0.5, 0.6, 0.6, and 0.9 million from 2012-2015), taking into account a modest impact from the beginning of un-grandfathering. 2Our international forecast for fewer net adds than prior year is due to a tough comparison against the Australia/New Zealand launch. The ANZ growth spike in Q2 last year resulted in international Q2 net adds more than doubling year over year (from 1.12 million to 2.37 million). While ANZ is growing steadily this Q2, it is less than the launch spike last year. Ex-ANZ, international net adds would be forecast up this quarter. International net adds are down sequentially both due to standard seasonality and our launch in 130 countries at very beginning of Q1 (so Q1 captured the initial surge of sign-ups). In the US, we are forecasting flat Y/Y contribution margin in Q2, due to a large slate of content releases and associated marketing. We expect strong y/y margin growth to resume in Q3 and we remain on track to achieve our 40% US contribution margin target by 2020. We expect Q2 international contribution loss to improve sequentially primarily due to recent favorable currency movements. We anticipate that international contribution losses in the second half of 2016 will be similar to the first half, as ongoing investments offset improved profitability in our more mature markets. On China, we are continuing discussions but have no material update on our approach or timing. Whatever we do will have only a modest financial effect in the near term. With respect to un-grandfathering, currently, more than half of our US members pay only $7.99 or $8.99 for our $9.99 HD 2-screen plan. We will phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest-tenured members getting the longest benefit. To reinforce brand trust, we won’t change anyone’s price without their acknowledgement of the new price in their member experience, where they will see a dialogue box about their options. Members can choose our $7.99 SD 1-screen plan, our $9.99 HD 2-screen plan or our $11.99 UHD 4-screen plan. We are rolling this out slowly over the year, rather than mostly in May, so we can learn as we go. Most of our grandfathered members are in the US, but we’ll take the same approach internationally. We expect only modestly increased churn from un-grandfathering, partially because these members have been with us for a reasonable period already, and because our content continues to improve. The increase in ARPU will allow us to invest more in content next year, and we are taking up our expected spend from about $5B in 2016 to over $6B on a P&L basis in 2017 (more on a cash basis). Content In Q1, we had our most ambitious slate of content releases to date. Since the February 19th premiere of Judd Apatow\\'s Love, we have debuted at least one new show or feature film every single week of the \\u200b \\u200b quarter. This includes five new seasons of original series as well as several original feature films, documentaries, kids shows and stand-up specials. We launched the second season of Marvel’s Daredevil \\u200b and the fourth season of House of Cards to strong critical reviews. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b In addition to stepping up the pace, we’re also broadening our programming to appeal to a large global membership base with diverse tastes. We expanded into the multi-camera sitcom format in Q1 with Fuller House, a family comedy that met with overwhelmingly positive viewer reception. Fuller House, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 3and the late Q4 release of true crime documentary Making a Murderer, are excellent examples of how \\u200b \\u200b Netflix is breaking through the cultural zeitgeist and how our portfolio of original content continues to be a great driver of membership growth for Netflix. We are maintaining a fast pace of content launches in Q2, starting with the recently released sitcom The \\u200b Ranch, starring Ashton Kutcher. We’ll launch seven new seasons of original series, including \\u200b Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Grace and Frankie and Orange is the New Black. We will also \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b premiere the original films The Do-Over, Adam Sandler’s second film for Netflix, Special Correspondents \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b featuring Ricky Gervais and Eric Bana, The Fundamentals of Caring, starring Paul Rudd and Brahman \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Naman from the maverick Indian director Q. \\u200b Q2 will also mark our initial foray into the talk show genre with Chelsea, starring Chelsea Handler. This \\u200b \\u200b talk show will be a bit of a departure from the normal “all episodes at once” model of our other originals. Chelsea will premiere new episodes nightly, three nights per week, shortly after the show is \\u200b \\u200b recorded in front of a live audience and will incorporate stylistic elements from her well-received Netflix documentary series Chelsea Does. We are excited to bring Chelsea Handler and this new show to our \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b\\u200b global platform that opens up our original content offering to include more topical programming that merges our already successful comedy and documentary efforts. Our investment in original content for kids and families has helped make Netflix a destination for great creators of live action and animated television. Our original series were nominated for 33 Daytime Emmy nominations across 7 of our original shows, including All Hail King Julien, Project MC2 and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Dragons: Race to The Edge. In Q2, we are releasing nine new seasons of original series for kids including \\u200b Kong: King of The Apes and a re-boot of Voltron. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b With our footprint now virtually global, Netflix is uniquely positioned to bring stories from all over the world to people all over the world. We’ve stepped up production of non-English language series following up on last year’s success of Club de Cuervos from Mexico and Narcos, which was filmed in \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Colombia in Spanish and English. Our first French series Marseille, a political drama starring Gerard \\u200b \\u200b Depardieu, premieres globally on May 5, while our new Japanese original series Hibana premieres \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b globally in June. We are also working on 3% in Brazil, Suburra in Italy, Dark in Germany, an \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b as-yet-untitled period series in Spain, a second season of Club De Cuervos and our second Mexican \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b original series, Ingobernable, starring Kate Del Castillo in Mexico, as well as our first fully global original \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b Japanese anime series Perfect Bones. These series help both to cement the popularity and relevance of \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b Netflix in the territories where they originate and, in success, will reach a broad global audience. We are investing about 5% of our cash content budget in original films. As we learn, we may spend beyond that, once we’ve established that new, fully-exclusive movies debuting on Netflix creates more consumer excitement and member viewing than the territory-by-territory licensing of nine-month-old “Pay One” movies that are also available on TVOD and DVD. Upcoming original films in the second half of 2016 include War Machine, a satirical comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by David Michod, and \\u200b \\u200b Mascots, the latest ensemble comedy from Christopher Guest. Our 2017 lineup includes Bong Joon-Ho’s \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b Okja, and Bright, an epic action film starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 4The release schedule for our announced upcoming original content can be found on our PR site. \\u200b \\u200b To highlight the expansion of our original content offering, we recently hosted an event in Paris for press and influencers from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Below is a photo of Kevin Spacey and Ted Sarandos, surrounded by our titles, before a large audience. Product At Netflix, we strive to deliver the best video experience for our members and picture quality is an important element of this. In 2014, we began streaming in 4K with the debut of House of Cards Season \\u200b \\u200b 2. Today, we have one of the largest catalogues of 4K content available, with the number of 4K titles increasing 10x since inception. Not surprisingly, streaming of 4K content is growing as a share of total viewing. We are also continuing to push the boundaries of visual impact and we\\'re excited about High Dynamic Range (HDR). While 4K offers more pixels, HDR provides greater depth with brighter highlights and a wider color range. Today, you can experience HDR on Netflix with Season One of Marco Polo, if you have \\u200b \\u200b an HDR-enabled TV and subscribe to our 4-screen UHD plan. We are expanding our HDR content catalogue rapidly. It wasn\\'t too long ago that online video was associated with grainy images and constant buffering. But today, the Internet, not cable or broadcast distribution, is actually home to the cutting edge of video quality and it will only get better from here as Internet TV replaces linear television. 5We started rolling out new and more efficient encodes during Q1, offering either 20% savings in data, or a commensurate increase in quality, depending on whether a consumer is bandwidth-limited or not. This will be reflected in our ISP speed index reports as a small reduction in average bitrate across all ISPs, but most of the value is realized in improved quality for our customers. We are now turning our attention to mobile-specific encodes, with a desire to deliver better video at lower bandwidth to these devices, which are increasingly important in our newest markets. Partnerships Similar to our content portfolio, our partnerships have expanded in scope over the years, growing in importance with the launch of our service across the world. Originally focused on consumer electronics device integration, Netflix partnerships now span a wide array of relationships with pay TV and mobile operators, Internet service providers, mobile device and set top box manufacturers, and brick and mortar retailers (gift cards). We integrate Netflix to make it easier for members to sign up, access and pay for the service. In addition, our partners benefit through customer acquisition, the opportunity to upsell higher value packages of speed/data/content, lower churn and increases in brand affinity. Recently, Canadian operator Telus said: \"Nearly half of Optik TV customers are also Netflix subscribers. Making Netflix available was a simple but powerful innovation to make our customers’ entertainment experience better, and far easier. Not only has this driven deeper engagement with our Optik customers who have Netflix, these same customers are actually consuming more content on Optik, including more on demand content, than ever before.” As Internet TV grows, it is exciting to be a part of a vibrant ecosystem driving innovation and value for consumers all over the world. Competition If you think about your last 30 days, and analyze the evenings you did not watch Netflix, you can understand how broad our competition really is. Whether you played video games, surfed the web, watched a DVD, TVOD, or linear TV, wandered through YouTube, read a book, streamed Hulu or Amazon, or pirated content (hopefully not), you can see the market for relaxation time and disposable income is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea. For example, while we’ve grown from zero to 47 million members in the USA, HBO has also grown, which shows how large the entertainment market is. We earn a tiny fraction of consumers’ time and money, and have lots of opportunity ahead to win more of your evenings away from all those other activities if we can keep improving. 6Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure At the end of Q1, we had cash and equivalents totaling $2.1 billion. In Q1, free cash flow was -$261 million, compared with -$276 million in Q4 ‘15. As we have written in the past, our investment in original programming (particularly owned content) is more cash intensive upfront, resulting in a timing-driven gap between net income and free cash flow. We currently have $2.4 billion of long term debt. With our low debt to enterprise value of 5%, our plan is to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016 or in early 2017. Given the attractiveness of our business model in a growth area relative to other large cap companies, as well as our low debt to EV ratio, investors view our bonds as quite secure; they trade better than the BB index, despite our single B credit rating, (but not yet as well as \\u200b \\u200b media firms like Viacom or Discovery).

       "  'We grew by 1.7m members in Q2 finishing with over 83 million members. This is below our forecast of 2.5m net new members and our prior year Q2 net additions of 3.3m. We are growing, but not as fast as we would like or have been. Disrupting a big market can be bumpy, but the opportunity ahead is as big as ever and we continue to improve every aspect of our business. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Our global member forecast for Q2 was 2.5m and we came in at 1.7m. Gross additions were on target, but churn ticked up slightly and unexpectedly, coincident with the press coverage in early April of our \\u200b \\u200b plan to un-grandfather longer tenured members and remained elevated through the quarter. We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering. Churn of members who were actually un-grandfathered is modest and conforms to our expectations. With our large subscriber base, slight variances in retention versus forecast can result in significant swings in net adds, particularly in a seasonally small net add quarter like Q2. While un-grandfathering and associated media coverage may moderate near-term membership growth, we believe that un-grandfathering will provide us with more revenue to invest in our content to satisfy members, thus driving long-term growth. Over the second half of this year, we’ll complete un-grandfathering. Our three-tier pricing (in the US: $7.99 SD, $9.99 HD, and $11.99 UHD) is working well for us and for new members, and our gross additions remain healthy. On earnings, we slightly under-forecast the quarter, ending Q2 with operating income of $70 million and net income of $41 million against a forecast of $47 million and $9 million with the variance largely due to lower-than-expected content and other costs. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and our goal is to be accurate, not conservative. Therefore, in some quarters, we may come in high versus our forecast and, in other quarters, we may come in low. In the US, our Q2 net additions were 0.16 million against a forecast of 0.50 million. US revenue rose 18% year over year with domestic ASP growing 4.5% year over year. As expected, US contribution margin at 34.3% expanded more moderately year over year, owing to the timing of content spend. In addition, marketing expenses rose sequentially in support of our growing slate of originals and business partnerships, which we expect to continue. As Internet TV rises in popularity, so do the SVOD offerings. In the US, for example, CBS All Access, Seeso, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, YouTube Red, and many others are all growing. Our view, however, is that we are all growing primarily against linear TV hours and that competition did not contribute materially to our miss in Q2. First, increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions rather than churn. Second, we experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April in Canada, where there has been no recent increase in SVOD competition but where un-grandfathering is also underway. Similarly, we don’t believe market saturation is a key factor in the US given that we experienced similar performance over the same period in multiple countries with differing levels of Netflix market penetration. 2Our global membership forecast for Q3 includes an impact from the spectacle of the Olympics, on par with what we experienced four years ago, and does not include any boost in the US from the Comcast X1 launch due to uncertainty on timing as we and Comcast will only release Netflix on the X1 when the viewer experience is great. For Q3, we forecast US net adds of 0.3 million as un-grandfathering continues. We expect US contribution margin to improve year over year in both Q3 and Q4 and we anticipate meeting our 40% US contribution margin target by 2020, or even earlier. International net additions in Q2 came to 1.5 million compared to our 2.0 million forecast. Un-grandfathering occurred in Canada, UK/Ireland, Latin America, and the Nordics during Q2 where, like the US, we saw a similar, earlier-than-expected impact on retention. In our newer markets, we continue to learn and believe that growth will unfold over a multi-year period, similar to our experience in Latin America. International revenue rose 67% year over year. Excluding the impact of F/X (-$37 million impact on a y/y basis), international ASP increased 8.7%. International contribution profit totaled -$69 million as content spending was slightly lower than our forecast. For Q3, we expect international net additions of 2.0m. Our approach in expanding our global footprint in January was to launch a service targeting early adopters and then to listen, learn and iterate quickly. Now that we are six months in, we will localize Netflix in Poland and Turkey with the addition of local language in the user interface, subtitles and dubbing. Localization in other markets will take place over time as economically prudent. International contribution loss in Q3 is expected to be -$95 million as improving profitability in our earlier foreign markets funds the investment in newer international territories. We remain confident in these investments because of our success in all of the markets launched prior to 2014 which are individually profitable on a contribution profit basis. These 2010-2013 launch markets are on track to deliver aggregate contribution profit of around $500 million in 2016. \\u200b Prior to the global launch of our service in January, Netflix was available in 60 countries. In these earlier expansion markets, our adoption rate in the first several months (as measured by penetration of broadband households) has been highly varied and the initial uptake is not necessarily indicative of our long-term penetration. We have already achieved success (contribution profits) in many types of markets including those where English is not the main language (e.g. Chile); that have low pay TV penetration (e.g. Australia); that have historically had high levels of piracy (e.g. Nordics); that have payment or broadband infrastructure challenges (e.g. Mexico with payments and Canada with low data caps); that have big competition (e.g. UK); that have low disposable income (e.g. Brazil); or that have many of these factors (e.g. most of Latin America). 3Unfortunately, this year the regulatory climate in China for our service has become more challenging. Disney’s streaming service, launched in conjunction with Alibaba, was closed down, as was Apple’s movie offering. We continue to explore options and, in the meantime, have plenty of work to do in our newly opened markets. Our global expansion is an exciting opportunity that will unfold over many years. Continued US growth will be a part of it and there is no change to our view that in the US Netflix can reach 60-90 million members. We continue to expect to run around break-even on a net income basis in 2016 and to generate material profits in 2017 and beyond. We will drive operating profit growth in 2017 by reducing our international losses and continuing to grow US profit. Content In Q2, we continued to expand the pace and breadth of original series, films and documentaries released on Netflix, including the 4th season of Orange is the New Black and the second of our Adam \\u200b \\u200b Sandler films, The Do Over, which, at launch, was the number one most-watched film on Netflix in every \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b territory of the world and remains in the top 10 in many countries, including the US. The substantial viewing of our growing slate of originals around the world is a testament to how well \\u200b \\u200b high quality English-language TV travels. Local content constitutes a small minority of total viewing in our international segment. We do not plan on trying to outcompete local TV networks in local content in every nation of the world. Rather, we selectively complement our service with licensed and original local content. We are developing non-English language original series and films in more than a dozen countries including Brazil, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, South Korea, Argentina and Spain when we find compelling, high quality projects with attractive economics and a potentially large audience around the world. Narcos, only partially in English, is an early success in this area. \\u200b \\u200b We are also pleased with the critical acclaim received by our original programming. Last week, 17 of our original series, documentaries, films and comedy specials received 54 Primetime Emmy nominations, up from 34 last year. Netflix saw the largest increase in nominations among networks and has the third \\u200b most total nominations of any domestic network (behind only FX and HBO). Earlier, nine of our kids’ \\u200b shows received 33 Daytime Emmy nominations, more than any other network. We have made good progress since launching our first original series Lilyhammer in 2012. \\u200b \\u200b While ramping up originals, we are also actively acquiring high quality, licensed content. We’ve extended our licensing agreement with The CW Network, making Netflix the US SVOD home for prior seasons of all scripted series broadcast on The CW beginning with the 2015-2016 TV season. Netflix members will be able to stream full seasons of programs like Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl, Arrow and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b The Flash, just eight days after each season finale. Next year, Netflix will also be the exclusive home of \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b the new Star Trek series from CBS outside the US and Canada, with new episodes arriving in 188 \\u200b \\u200b countries within 24 hours of their North American premiere. 4Marketing We primarily market our originals to drive member acquisition. Building off that, this past quarter we began testing the availability of select episodes of a few of our original shows on linear television in partnership with broadcasters. One week after its premiere on Netflix, the first two episodes of our first French original series, Marseille, aired on French broadcast network TF1. Season one episodes (but not \\u200b \\u200b season two) of Narcos and Club de Cuervos will air on Univision and Unimas, respectively, in the US. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Through these tactics, we’re aiming to entice consumers to join Netflix to complete their binge. The danger is diluting the perception that Netflix original content is only on Netflix, so we are testing cautiously. Product and Partnerships As we have noted in the past, our global expansion in January means that we are now operating in some markets where consumers access the Internet primarily through mobile devices. This has led us to invest more in our mobile experience including sign up, authentication, user interface, payments and streaming efficiency for cellular networks. In Q2, we began testing Google Play in-app payment on Android devices, which we think will aid our ability to acquire new customers in many international markets, as our iOS in-app payments have done. To date, we have partnered with over 40 MVPDs across the world to make it easier for consumers to enjoy and pay for Netflix, to grow awareness of our service in certain markets and to reach different demographic segments. In the US, we are excited that Netflix will be available on the Comcast X1 set-top box later this year. Strong Net Neutrality We continue to make progress with Open Connect, and the approval of the Charter/TWC merger with a seven year condition of settlement-free interconnect is a helpful precedent. When ISPs around the world agree to take our Open Connect servers in or near their networks for free, they see reductions in their network costs, and as a result, the program has continued to grow in popularity. Competition Our goal remains to win as many “moments of truth” as we can. Given all the leisure activities consumers can engage in - reading a book, playing videogames, watching a sports match, etc. - we compete with a very broad set of alternatives. Our focus is to improve Netflix every day across multiple dimensions including content, streaming quality, device footprint, payment options, and more. If we can do that, we believe we have ample room to grow. There are an increasing number of virtual MVPDs, like Sony Vue, DISH’s Sling TV, Amazon’s Streaming Partners Program, and Hulu’s forthcoming service, which offer a smaller bundle of TV channels at a \\u200b \\u200b lower cost per month. To the degree these services provide an improved MVPD experience or spur improvement amongst incumbent MVPDs to become more Internet-centric (on-demand, multi-screen, personalized), they will become increased competition for entertainment time. 5In the most recent Sandvine report, our share of North American Internet traffic was 35%. As we referenced in our Q4 ’15 letter in January, our implementation of more efficient encoding would reduce \\u200b \\u200b our results in the Sandvine report, which measures peak megabits, not peak viewing hours. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q2’16, free cash flow amounted to -$254 million, compared with -$261 million in Q1’16. We finished the quarter with cash and equivalents of $1.8 billion, while gross debt was unchanged at $2.4 billion. We still plan to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016/early 2017. Our capital requirements continue to be driven by our investment in original content, particularly programming that we produce, which requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content. Original content provides Netflix with many benefits: new programming that debuts on Netflix, exclusivity, greater creative and business control, global rights and brand halo. These merits outweigh the timing of cash payments. Our choice to fund these requirements through debt rather than equity is based on our desire to optimize our capital structure to yield the lowest possible weighted average cost of capital. Given our low debt to total capital ratio, the after tax cost of debt is currently more attractive than equity. DVD We finished Q2’16 with 4.5 million DVD members in the US, and contribution profit of $71 million.

       "  'In Q3, quarterly global streaming revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time (up 36% year over year), helped by our strong content slate including Stranger Things and the second season of Narcos. On a \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b constant currency basis, this represents 39% year-over-year revenue growth, a 400 basis point acceleration from the last two quarters. Our summary results and forecast are below: Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Global streaming revenue totaled $2.2 billion, of which 40% was generated abroad. Operating income amounted to $106 million (compared with our $64 million estimate) while net income was $52 million (vs. forecast of $22 million). In Q3, we added 0.4 million members in the US vs. our forecast of 0.3 million and 3.2 million members internationally vs. our forecast of 2.0 million. Our over-performance against forecast (86.7m total streaming members vs. forecast of 85.5m) was driven primarily by stronger than expected acquisition due to excitement around Netflix original content. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, we under forecasted member growth, while in Q2, it was the opposite. For the first nine months of 2016, we’ve added 12 million global members, the same as in the first nine months of 2015. By the end of Q3’16, we had un-grandfathered 75% of the members that are being un-grandfathered this year and the impact has been consistent with our expectations. ASP grew over 10% year-over-year in both the US and international segments (excluding a $35 million F/X impact). With more revenue, we can reinvest to further improve Netflix to attract new members from around the world, while continuing to delight our existing customers. Domestically, revenue rose 23% year over year, 480 basis points faster than Q2. US marketing expense rose as a percentage of revenue as we spent to build awareness for our expanding number of original titles. US contribution profit increased 38% year-over-year with contribution margin expanding to 36%, slightly ahead of our 35% forecast. In the international segment, we exceeded our internal projection for net adds as the acquisition impact of our originals was greater than anticipated across many of our markets. F/X-neutral revenue rose 72% and international contribution loss was flat sequentially at $69 million as content costs came in under our forecast due partly to timing. We are investing in more content across multiple international markets in Q4 and, as a result, we project international contribution loss to grow moderately to $75 million. In September, we localized Netflix in Poland and Turkey. We began accepting payment in local currency and added a local language user interface, subtitles and dubbing as well as some local content. We have seen nice gains in viewing and retention and we’ll undertake other localization efforts in the coming months and years. For Q4, we forecast 5.2 million global net adds, with 1.45 million net adds in the US and 3.75 million new members internationally. Our expectation for a moderate year-over-year decline in net adds reflects the completion of un-grandfathering. We are pleased with the results thus far as we expect ASP to grow 12% from Q1’16 to Q4’16. Internationally, the initial demand from our launch in Spain, Portugal and Italy in Q4’15 will also affect our year-over-year net adds comparison. 2We will face a tough international net adds comparison in Q1’17 because of the initial membership surge in Q1’16 tied to the launch of 130 additional territories. As discussed, for the balance of 2016, we will continue to operate around break even, and then start generating material global profits in 2017 and beyond, by marching up operating margins steadily for many years. Content We kicked off Q3 with the release of Stranger Things on July 15 to both critical and audience acclaim. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b This nostalgic, supernatural thriller proved to be the blockbuster of the summer and is the kind of broad \\u200b \\u200b appeal, cross demographic, and cross border sensation that we hope will distinguish Netflix original content. Stranger Things is also notable as it is produced and owned by Netflix, which provides us with \\u200b \\u200b more attractive economics and greater business and creative control. In August, we launched The Get \\u200b Down, a highly stylized drama set in 1970s New York City, detailing the origins of hip-hop. We look \\u200b forward to releasing part two of season one next year. Our hit series Narcos returned for season two in September to great success among critics and \\u200b \\u200b audiences alike. Narcos had a positive impact on member acquisition across all of our markets, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b demonstrating the ability for our tentpole franchises to connect with audiences across the world. We closed the quarter with Marvel’s Luke Cage, the latest installment in our Marvel series, which will \\u200b \\u200b continue with Iron Fist on March 17, 2017. We are also looking forward next year to The Defenders, a \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b team-up of the characters from our first four Marvel series. We are now in the fourth year of our original content strategy and are pleased with our progress. In 2017, we intend to release over 1,000 hours of premium original programming, up from over 600 hours this year. The Internet allows us to reach audiences all over the world and, with a growing base of over 86 million members, there’s a large appetite for entertainment and a diversity of tastes to satisfy. We are fortunate that our Internet-centric, on-demand, subscription-only business model allows us to support programs for both mass and niche audiences alike. Our personalization algorithms help us promote the right content to the right viewers. And since we are not shelf-space constrained nor reliant on advertising, we have the luxury to tell all kinds of stories in less traditional ways. The growth of Internet TV globally has ushered in a new golden age of content, with consumers everywhere enjoying unprecedented access to amazing amounts of high quality programming. With an expanding content budget (approximately $6 billion in 2017 on a P&L basis), we judge the success of our portfolio of originals in several ways. For each series or film, we measure the impact on acquisition and member engagement which, in turn, is correlated with retention. To determine relative performance, we look at each title’s share of viewing compared with its share of our content budget. We also take into account qualitative factors such as earned media coverage and awards, which enhance our brand and our ability to attract talent for future projects. This year, we are thrilled to have won nine Emmys (out of 54 nominations) across six different shows. 3This past quarter, we announced a global pact with 20th Century Fox Studios to license The People vs. \\u200b O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story and Queen of the South and an agreement with The Walt Disney Co. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b to license Quantico and American Crime in the US and Canada. We are also increasingly ensuring early \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b financing and sharing windows globally with original broadcasters for series like Star Trek: Discovery \\u200b from CBS, The Alienist from Paramount TV and the just-launched ABC series Designated Survivor from \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b eOne. Product and Partnerships We continue to make progress with our MVPD partnerships. We are excited that the Netflix app will be available across Liberty Global’s footprint beginning in the Netherlands later this year and expanding to \\u200b \\u200b other countries in 2017. Partnerships like this and our integration on X1 with Comcast validate the \\u200b \\u200b strength of our content and that we are additive to the current offerings of MVPDs. By working together, MVPDs can sell richer Internet and TV packages, while consumers can more easily sign up for and access Netflix, thus allowing Netflix and our partners to better serve our shared customers. China The regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging. We now plan to license content to existing online service providers in China rather than operate our own service in China in the near term. We expect revenue from this licensing will be modest. We still have a long term desire to serve the Chinese people directly, and hope to launch our service in China eventually. Competition We face immense competition for consumer screen time. Despite video gaming getting better, video messaging and sharing improving, MVPD UI enhancements, YouTube growth, more SVOD services, and other screen time competitors, Netflix continues to win both time and affection. We presume that Amazon Prime Video will become as global as YouTube and Netflix this fall with the launch of the Jeremy Clarkson show. Our challenge is to continue to improve our service and content so that we better meet consumer desires. Total screen time is quite large and growing as technology and content improve globally. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q3, free cash flow was -$506 million vs. -$254 million in Q2’16 and -$252 million in the year ago quarter. The increase in our free cash flow deficit reflects the growth of original content, which we are increasingly producing and owning (rather than licensing). Self-produced shows like Stranger Things \\u200b require more cash upfront as we incur spending during the creation of each show prior to its completion and release. In comparison, we generally pay on delivery for licensed originals like Orange is the New \\u200b Black and we pay over the term of the agreement for licensed non-originals (eg, Scandal). \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 4Over the long run, we believe self-producing is less expensive (including cost of capital) than licensing a series or film, as we work directly with the creative community and eliminate additional overhead and fees. In addition, we own the underlying intellectual property, providing us with global rights and more business and creative control. Combined with the success of our portfolio of originals and the positive impact on our member and revenue growth, we believe this is a wise investment that creates long term value. Consequently, we plan on investing more, which will continue to weigh on free cash flow. We expect Q4’16 FCF to be similar to Q3’16 FCF. Over time, we will be able to fund more of our investment in programming through the growth in operating profit and margin already underway. Streaming content obligations at quarter end were $14.4 billion, up $1 billion sequentially. The increase reflects the addition of both new original and non-original content to our library as well as expanded rights for our new territories. We finished the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents. As we have often done over the past few years, we plan to raise additional debt in the coming weeks. With a debt to total capitalization ratio of about 5%, we remain underleveraged compared both to similar firms and to our view of an efficient capital structure. Our 2025 bonds continue to trade well. \\u200b \\u200b Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: July 2016, April 2016, January, 2016, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b October 2015, July 2015, April 2015, January 2015, October 2014. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Conclusion We have many fantastic titles to enjoy.

       "  \"In 2016, we generated $8.3 billion in global streaming revenue (35% y/y growth) and finished the year with 93.8 million members on 19.0 million net additions vs. 17.4 million in 2015. This quarter marks the 10-year anniversary of our launch of streaming. The next decade will be even more amazing and \\u200b \\u200b tumultuous as internet TV supplants linear TV, and as we strive to remain a leader. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast In Q4, global streaming revenue grew 41% year over year to $2.4 billion, while contribution profit rose 74% year over year to $470 million (20% margin). Operating profit totaled $154 million (6.2% operating margin) against guidance of $125 million, while net income amounted to $67 million, compared with our forecast of $56 million. Net income included a -$22 million foreign exchange adjustment booked in other expense due to the strength of the US dollar. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We added 7.05 million net new members globally in the quarter, against our forecast of 5.20 million and last year's Q4 performance of 5.59 million. This was the largest quarter of net additions in our history and was driven by strong acquisition trends in both our US and International segments. Domestically, we added 1.93 million members in the quarter, exceeding our forecast of 1.45 million and 1.56 million in the year-ago quarter. Combined with 15% ASP growth, revenue increased 27% year-over -year to $1.4 billion. US contribution margin expanded 395 basis points year-over-year to 38.2%. Margin improvement was greater than expected due primarily to higher-than-forecast revenue and the timing of content deals. International membership grew by 5.12 million in Q4, against a forecast of 3.75 million and 4.04 million in the year-ago quarter. Over 47% of our total members are now outside of the US. This growth was very broad based geographically as our original content continues to be well-received all over the world. ASP for the international segment rose 13% year over year (excluding a -$21 million impact from currency). International contribution loss was -$67 million, compared with our forecast of -$75 million, as content spend was slightly lower than expected owing primarily to timing. In Q1, we project 5.2 million net adds with 1.5 million in the US and 3.7 million internationally. Our anticipation for a year-over-year decline in domestic net adds reflects a difficult comparison in the year ago quarter where we exceeded our net adds forecast by 27%. Similarly, in our international segment, we will lap our Rest of World launch in January of last year. We also expect a greater membership impact from our content slate in the second half of 2017. On a sequential basis, we believe our strong Q4 results likely pulled forward some net adds from Q1’17 to Q4’16. Since our global expansion is proceeding well, we intend to grow our global operating margin for many years ahead. We’ve been around a 4% annual operating margin for the past two years, and we are targeting about 7% for the full year 2017 based on current F/X rates. From here, we will seek to steadily increase revenue and operating margin as we balance growth and profitability. We are in no rush to push margins up too quickly, as we want to ensure we are investing aggressively enough to continue to lead internet TV around the world. In Q1, we are forecasting a 9% operating margin, higher than our full year target due to the timing of content spend, including moving House of Cards season 5 from Q1 to \\u200b \\u200b Q2. 2We anticipate the international segment will be slightly contribution profit positive in Q1. We plan on investing over the remaining quarters of 2017 internationally and, as a result, anticipate an international contribution loss in Q2. On a full year basis, we expect international contribution loss to improve substantially year on year. Content We are learning rapidly how best to match content with audience tastes around the world. It is clear to us that high quality content travels well across borders. For instance, our global originals like Marvel’s \\u200b Luke Cage, The Crown and season 3 of Black Mirror continue to generate excitement and excellent \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b viewing all across the world. Similarly, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life debuted in the top 10 in every \\u200b \\u200b territory. Guillermo Del Toro’s Trollhunters, launched in December, is tracking to be our most-watched \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b kids original and is performing particularly well in our newer territories. We closed the quarter with the release of The OA, a mind-bending, multi-layered supernatural drama that is a great example of the \\u200b \\u200b bold, creative storytelling we’ve aimed to support. Gratifyingly, our first Brazilian original series 3%, a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic thriller, premiered as one of \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b the most watched originals in Brazil and played well throughout Latin America. Moreover, bucking conventional wisdom, millions of US members have watched the show dubbed and subtitled into English, making 3% the first Portuguese language television show to travel meaningfully beyond Latin \\u200b \\u200b America and Portugal. We continue to invest in local programming to complement our content offering and as a means to introduce new members to our global library. We are focusing on local content that travels pan-regionally or across multiple territories, such as Japanese anime and Turkish dramas. In this vein, we announced a long-term deal with Red Chillies Entertainment, the film production company of Shah Rukh Khan, who is considered by many to be the biggest movie star on the planet. Netflix is now the exclusive \\u200b \\u200b global home for Khan’s new films and members will enjoy exclusive SVOD access to dozens of popular Red Chillies films from the past several years. It’s amazing to think that we launched original programming on Netflix in 2013 and in just four years, our original series accounted for five of the top 10 most searched TV shows of 2016 globally, including \\u200b \\u200b Stranger Things at #1, according to Google trends. On January 8, we were honored that The Crown \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b received the Golden Globe Award for Best TV Series (Drama), while Claire Foy won the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a TV Series (Drama) for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II. Later this month, The Screen Actors Guild Awards, the most widely voted-on major awards for TV and films, will \\u200b \\u200b feature eight individual Netflix original series with 17 nominations, the most of any network. We are incredibly excited about all the projects we have underway for our global members, no matter their age, taste or cultural background; in 2017, we plan to invest over $6 billion on content on a P&L basis (up from $5 billion in 2016). 3Product and Partnerships In Q4, we launched offline viewing, which allows members to download content to iOS and Android devices. Our goal is to make Netflix as accessible as possible to members in countries and locations (such as subways and airplanes) with limited and/or expensive bandwidth. We are pleased with the initial results and, as expected, enjoyment of offline viewing is greatest in emerging markets, where the broadband infrastructure is less robust. In Q4 we also launched on Comcast’s X1 set-top boxes, and the integration has pleased our members who now can use their X1 remote control and user interface to access Netflix as they do their other TV networks. Net Neutrality Weakening of US net neutrality laws, should that occur, is unlikely to materially affect our domestic margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our relationships with ISPs stable. On a public policy basis, however, strong net neutrality is important to support innovation and smaller firms. No one wants ISPs to decide what new and potentially disruptive services can operate over their networks, or to favor one service over another. We hope the new US administration and Congress will recognize that keeping the network neutral drives job growth and innovation. Competition Internet video is a global phenomenon. Amazon Prime Video expanded recently to match our territory footprint, while YouTube remains far larger than either of us in terms of global video enjoyment minutes. Video consumption is growing on Facebook, and Apple is rumored to be adding video to its music service. Satellite TV operators are moving to become internet MVPDs, such as ViaSat to ViaPlay in the Nordics, DISH to Sling, and DirecTV to DirecTV Now. Insurgent firms such as Molotov.tv in France and Hulu are building native-internet interfaces for TV network bundles. CBS is releasing a major original series (Star Trek) exclusively on its domestic SVOD service (with us as international partner). Finally, the \\u200b \\u200b BBC has become the first major linear network to announce plans to go binge-first with new seasons, \\u200b \\u200b favoring internet over linear viewers. We presume HBO is not far behind the BBC. In short, it’s becoming an internet TV world, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Netflix as we strive to earn screen time. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Q4 free cash flow totaled -$639 million vs. -$276 million last Q4 and -$506 million in Q3’16. The sequential increase was largely due to the timing of content payments, including our growing slate of self-produced originals. Producing more owned content creates some lumpiness in our working capital needs. We expect our FCF to be around -$2 billion in 2017 vs. -$1.7 billion in 2016, with FCF loss improving sequentially in Q1’17. 4We are funding our working capital needs through the debt market. In October, we raised $1 billion of senior notes with a coupon of 4.375%, which will reduce our weighted average cost of capital. We will continue to be a regular issuer of debt to finance our investment in original content as we balance our cash needs with the carrying cost of interest expense. Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2016, July 2016, April 2016, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b January, 2016, October 2015, July 2015, April 2015, January 2015. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Summary In 2016, we launched globally (excluding China) and made good progress.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the \\u200b release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net \\u200b income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial \\u200b statements. 5\"),\n",

       "  'In Q1, we surpassed $2.5 billion in quarterly streaming revenue and added 5 million members. The opportunity provided to us by the growth of the global internet is gigantic and our plan is to keep investing as we increase membership, revenue and operating margins. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast The quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report, and we strive for accuracy. In Q1, there were no substantial variations from our January guidance forecast. Due to content (primarily House of Cards season 5) moving from Q1 to Q2, we had higher operating \\u200b \\u200b margins in Q1 (as forecasted) at 9.7% than our plan for the year (about 7%). We forecast operating margin at 4.4% in Q2, placing us on track to reach our 7% target for the full year. The other effect of the content moves is lower net adds in Q1 compared to prior year (as expected) and heavier net adds in Q2 compared to prior year (about double). We have come to see these quarterly variances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV. For the first half of this year, for example, we expect to have 8.15 million net adds, compared to 8.42 million net adds in the first half last year. International net additions decreased 22% year over year, as we lapped our January 2016 launch of over 130 countries, and the accompanying early surge demand, in Q1 2016. Revenue for the international segment grew 62% year over year, excluding a -$12 million impact from currency, while ASP rose 12% year over year on a F/X neutral basis. Q1 was the first quarter of consolidated profit for our international segment as profit growth in our more mature territories offset investments in newer markets. Our forward guidance shows that we intend to continue to invest internationally, projecting a small loss for Q2. We have high satisfaction and are rapidly growing in Latin America, Europe, and North America. We are making good strides in improving our content offering to match local tastes in Asia, Middle East, and Africa, but have much progress to make, like in Latin America a few years ago. Our year-over-year streaming revenue growth is benefiting from a price change in mid 2016, and will moderate over the course of the year to track membership growth more closely. We are seeing a small but steady migration to our 4-stream, 4K-UHD-HDR video quality tier, which is our high end plan. That will keep revenue growth slightly above membership growth, holding F/X constant. For the last several years we’ve had flat operating margins due to established markets funding international expansion with every spare dollar we had. Because of that, the major indicators of our progress were member and revenue growth and US contribution margins. Starting this year, we can be primarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics. The summary table above has been reorganized to reflect that, while maintaining comparability to the past. Content With a growing member base spread across the world, we seek to please diverse tastes with a wide breadth of content. The key releases this past quarter highlight this range of programming: A Series of \\u200b Unfortunate Events, a dark comedy for the entire family, Santa Clarita Diet, a “zom-com” starring Drew \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Barrymore and Ultimate Beastmaster, our first competition show which pits athletes from around the \\u200b \\u200b globe against a fearsome 600-foot obstacle course. 2In addition to these titles, on March 17, we debuted Marvel’s Iron Fist, which has quickly become \\u200b \\u200b another highly viewed Marvel series, and sets the stage for The Defenders, which brings together all the \\u200b \\u200b characters from the Marvel series later this year. A week later, we launched Ingobernable, our second \\u200b \\u200b Mexican series, starring Kate del Castillo, which has been very popular in Mexico. On the last day of Q1, we unveiled 13 Reasons Why. Below is global search volume for several of our big launches over the last \\u200b \\u200b year. We have also stepped up our investment in stand up comedy which we believe can help grow our business, like our original series. Early results are promising; the triumphant return of a comedy legend in Dave Chappelle: Collection 1 was our most viewed comedy special ever. We are also finding this to be \\u200b \\u200b true in international markets as well, with comedian Gad Elmaleh’s Gad Gone Wild, a breakout hit in \\u200b \\u200b France last quarter. Just ahead of the release of our third film from Adam Sandler, Sandy Wexler, we announced the renewal \\u200b \\u200b of our deal with Sandler to premiere an additional four films exclusively on Netflix around the world. We continue to be excited by our Sandler relationship and our members continue to be thrilled with his films. Since the launch of The Ridiculous 6, Netflix members have spent more than half a billion hours \\u200b \\u200b enjoying the films of Adam Sandler. We recently hired Scott Stuber to lead our original films initiative. Our goal remains the same: to offer a \\u200b \\u200b variety of new movies that will attract and delight members at better economics relative to licensing movies under traditional windowing. Some of our early movies have been successful by this measure, such as the Sandler movies and Siege of Jadotville. Others, such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Sword of Destiny, have not. Scott’s mandate is to increase both the portfolio and the percentage of \\u200b films that delight many of our members relative to the film’s cost. 3Since our members are funding these films, they should be the first to see them. But we are also open to supporting the large theater chains, such as AMC and Regal in the US, if they want to offer our films, such as our upcoming Will Smith film Bright, in theatres simultaneous to Netflix. Let consumers choose. \\u200b \\u200b Product As always, our product team has dozens of tests running in the endless quest for even higher member satisfaction. One test that won conclusively last year and has now been rolled out to all members is our new “thumbs-up thumbs-down” feedback model, replacing the 5-star model we have had from our DVD days. The amount of usage we get with this new approach is over twice as many ratings. With this additional personal input, we’ll be able to improve personalization, making your front screen on Netflix even more relevant. A multi-year effort ahead is to have video replace still images in our user experience in ways that please our members and help them choose what to watch. Video for choosing video is an obvious direction, but doing it well through our interface takes judgment, creativity, and testing. In April, we will add Thai and later in the quarter, Romanian and Hebrew, to the 24 languages we currently support. Marketing As our slate of content expands, we’ll spend over $1 billion in 2017 marketing our content to drive member acquisition. As part of this, we are investing more in programmatic advertising with the aim of improving our ability to do individualized marketing at scale and to deliver the right ad to the right person at the right time. Buttressing this activity is the substantial earned media coverage around the Netflix brand, technology and content we generate globally through events and activities aimed at journalists and social media influencers. We also market our content extensively to members through our service and with our partners. For instance, we participated in Comcast’s Watchathon in April, providing X1 subscribers unlimited access to Netflix for a week. Competition Our investors often ask us about ecosystem change, such as the advent in the US of virtual MVPDs (like Sling, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, YouTube TV and Hulu’s forthcoming service). We believe VMVPDs will likely be more directly competitive to existing MVPD services since they offer a subset of the same channels at $30-$60 per month, and may appeal to a segment of the population that doesn’t subscribe to a pay TV bundle. But we don’t think it will have much of an impact on us as Netflix is largely complementary to pay TV packages. Our focus also is on on-demand, commercial free viewing rather than live, ad-supported programming. Additionally, investors ask us about Amazon’s move into NFL football. That is not a strategy that we think is smart for us since we believe we can earn more viewing and satisfaction from spending that money on movies and TV shows. 4Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q1’17 was -$423 million vs. -$261 million in the year ago quarter and an improvement from -$639 million in Q4’16. The growth in our original content means we continue to plan to have around $2B in negative FCF this year. We have a large market opportunity ahead of us and we’re optimizing long-term FCF by growing our original content aggressively. Negative near-term FCF is the result of the big increases in our original content, combined with small but growing operating margins. Since we want our operating margins to grow slowly so we can spend enough to quickly grow revenue and original content, we anticipate negative FCF to accompany our rapid growth for many years. Our operating margins are our key indicator of improving global profitability; they are already growing and we plan to keep them growing for many years ahead. Eventually, at a much larger revenue base, original content and revenue growth will be slower, and we anticipate substantial positive FCF, like our media peers. Our debt to total cap ratio, at under 10%, is quite conservative compared to most of our media peers at 30-70%, and conservative compared to efficient capital structure theory. Thus we will continue to add long-term debt as needed to finance our expansion of original content, including in Q2’17.

       "  \"For Q2, revenue and operating income were right on forecast. Our streaming membership grew more than expected, from 99m to 104m, due to our amazing content. We also crossed the symbolic milestones of 100m members and more international than domestic members. It was a good quarter. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Our quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q2, we underestimated the popularity of our strong slate of content which led to higher-than-expected acquisition across all major territories. As a result, global net adds totaled a Q2-record 5.2 million (vs. forecast of 3.2m) and increased 5% sequentially, bucking historical seasonal patterns. For the first six months of 2017, net adds are up 21% year-on-year to 10.2m. Our Q3 guidance assumes much of this momentum will continue but we are cognizant of the lessons of prior quarters when we over-forecasted and there was lumpiness in net adds, likely due to demand being pulled forward (into Q2 in this case). Domestic net additions of 1.1m represented the highest level of Q2 net adds since the second quarter of 2011. For Q3’17, we project that we will add 0.75m US members, compared with 0.37m in Q3’16, which was impacted by un-grandfathering. Our international segment now accounts for 50.1% of our total membership base. International revenue rose 57% year over year, excluding a -$23 million impact from foreign exchange, while international ASP grew 10% year over year on a F/X neutral basis. International contribution profit of -$13 million vs. -$69 million was better than our -$28 million forecast due primarily to higher-than-forecasted paid members. We’re forecasting Q3’17 international net adds of 3.65 million. We are making good progress with our international expansion as improving profitability in our earlier international markets helps fund significant investment in our newer territories. As a result, we expect positive international \\u200b contribution profit for the full year 2017, at current F/X exchange rates. This would mark the first ever \\u200b annual contribution profit from our international segment. For Q2, global streaming revenue was within 1% of our projection. As expected, operating margin dipped 516 basis points sequentially due to the timing of content releases, and came in at $128m on forecast of $120m. Through the first half of 2017, our operating margin was 7.1%, putting us on track for our full year target of 7%, which we plan on growing in 2018 and beyond. Q2 EPS was on target at $0.15, as a greater than expected tax benefit offset a -$64 million non-cash unrealized loss from our euro bond (which was recognized in our P&L in interest and other income/expense). Content Last week, the Television Academy nominated 27 Netflix original programs with 91 Emmy nominations, nearly double last year’s tally. With five of the 14 total nominated best series contenders (Stranger \\u200b Things, The Crown, House of Cards, Master of None and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt), Netflix had the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b most nominated series of any network. We are proud that even as we have increased our volume of originals across several genres, we continue to grow the recognition for the quality of those shows, including brand new series like Stranger Things and The Crown, which will have second season \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b premieres in 2017. The volume and breadth of our releases in Q2 exemplify our commitment to serve the desires of our diverse and growing audience. We premiered 14 new seasons of global Netflix original series, 13 original 2comedy specials, 6 original documentaries, 2 original documentary series, 9 original feature films and 7 seasons of original series for kids. You can track the dates of all of our upcoming launches here. \\u200b \\u200b We strive to be bold in our programming choices and financially disciplined, so we can keep being bold. \\u200b \\u200b Every show has passionate fans and committed talent striving for excellence. Sometimes those shows don’t attract as many viewers as we had hoped, compared to our other content. As much as we dislike ending a series early, it consoles us that it frees up investment for another new show, or two. We are programming to please our members and we keep that as our guiding light. We love it when we support a new series that has big impact like Stranger Things, Cable Girls, and 13 Reasons Why. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b As a global TV network, we also showcase local productions to a worldwide audience through our investments in non-English language originals. Our Spanish language original Ingobernable, starring Kate \\u200b \\u200b del Castillo, has been viewed by millions of members outside of Mexico. Similarly, in Q2, our first original from Spain, Las Chicas del Cable (Cable Girls), attracted significant viewership in the US and throughout \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b the entire Spanish-speaking world. We understand that our approach to films - debuting movies on Netflix first - is counter to Hollywood’s century-old windowing tradition. But just as we changed and reinvented the TV business by putting \\u200b \\u200b consumers first and making access to content more convenient, we believe internet TV can similarly reinvigorate the film business (as distinct from the theatrical business). This year we will release 40 features that range from big budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema. We are proud to produce films like Okja, War Machine and Bright, with big stars, distinctive directors and compelling \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b stories, as well as to introduce new voices like Macon Blair, whose directorial debut I Don’t Feel at Home \\u200b in This World Anymore, produced by Netflix, won the Dramatic Jury competition at the Sundance Film \\u200b Festival this year. Within a few weeks of the win, it premiered on Netflix everywhere, so that it could be enjoyed by fans, exactly when the world was talking about it. Product and Partnerships Since the early days of our streaming service, we have partnered with a wide variety of companies to make it easier for consumers to enjoy Netflix. Our partnerships began with consumer electronic companies and video game consoles and evolved to include smartphone makers, mobile operators and MVPDs and ISPs. In Q2, we announced a partnership with Altice/SFR France, whereby Netflix will be sold in a package with high speed Internet and TV services. These arrangements are mutually beneficial - our partners gain more customers and can upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while Netflix gains more reach and awareness with consumers across a market. We are likely to expand this approach as a complement to our direct-to-consumer primary approach. Competition The competition for entertainment time is always intense, but the silver lining is that the market is vast and diverse. YouTube is earning over a billion hours a day of consumers’ time with one type of entertainment, while we are earning over a billion hours a week with our type of entertainment. Linear TV is still huge, piracy still substantial, and there are thousands of firms and approaches around the world earning some fraction of consumers’ entertainment time. The entertainment market is so broad 3that we’ve grown from zero to over 50m streaming households in the US over the last 10 years, and yet HBO continues to increase its US subscriptions. It seems our growth just expands the market. The largely exclusive nature of each service’s content means that we are not direct substitutes for each other, but rather complements. In addition to the many SVOD players around the world (Blim, Globoplay, FilmStruck, Hooq, iflix, Stan, etc.) the large-cap tech companies, especially Amazon, are investing heavily in original and licensed content around the world. They join all the existing TV networks (BBC, AMC, NHK, etc.) of the world, and us, in bidding for great content. Creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment is pouring into content production around the world. We are all co-pioneers of internet TV and, together, we are replacing linear TV. The shift from linear TV to on-demand viewing is so big and there is so much leisure time, many internet TV services will be successful. The internet may not have been great for the music business due to piracy, but, wow, it is incredible for growing the video entertainment business around the world. Culture We recently crafted a major update on our culture description, to reflect our thinking as we have \\u200b \\u200b become more global. Our culture plays a major role in our continued evolution and success. Free Cashflow and Capital Structure Q2’17 free cash amounted to -$608 million vs. -$254 million in the year ago quarter and -$423 million in Q1’17. We anticipate free cash flow of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. With our content strategy paying off in strong member, revenue and profit growth, we think it’s wise to continue to invest. In continued success, we will deploy increased capital in content, particularly in owned originals, and, as we have said before, we expect to be FCF negative for many years. Since our FCF is driven by our content investment, particularly in self-produced originals, we wanted to provide some additional context on our content accounting at our investor relations website. \\u200b \\u200b We continue to debt finance our capital needs as we believe this reduces our weighted average cost of capital, resulting in a more efficient capital structure. In May, we completed a 1.3 billion euro bond offering. In addition to a small natural hedge to our growing European revenues, we are pleased to have broadened our access to capital markets beyond the US high yield market. Our euro bond may add some volatility to our net income as each quarter we remeasure the liability on our balance sheet based on the quarter end euro-to-dollar exchange rate. As a reminder, quarter-to-quarter remeasurement changes in this liability are reflected as a non-cash unrealized gain (loss) below operating income in “interest and other income/expense” in our P&L (-$64 million impact on net income in Q2’17). Summary It’s been twenty years since Netflix was founded and we still thrive on connecting people with great stories.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       "  \"We are growing nicely across the world and are on track to exceed $11 billion in revenue in 2017. Internet entertainment is delighting consumers, and we are staying at the forefront of this once-in-a-generation opportunity. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Global streaming revenue in Q3 rose 33% year over year, driven by a 24% increase in average paid memberships and 7% growth in ASP. Operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $209 million with our Q3 global operating margin of 7.0% putting us right on track to achieve our full year target of 7%. EPS of $0.29 included a pre-tax $51 million non-cash loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro bond (or $39 million after tax based on a 24% tax rate). Higher than expected excess tax benefit from stock based compensation benefited our tax rate by $5 million vs. our forecast. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We added a Q3-record 5.3 million memberships globally (up 49% year-over-year) as we continued to benefit from strong appetite for our original series and films, as well as the adoption of internet entertainment across the world. Relative to our guidance of 4.4 million net adds, we under-forecasted both US and international acquisition. Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29% versus last year. Domestic contribution margin in Q3 of 35.8% vs. 36.4% last year was below our forecast of 37.1% due primarily to the earlier-than-anticipated close of certain content deals. The foreign currency impact in the quarter was +$13 million and Q3 international revenue grew 54% year over year, excluding currency. F/X-neutral ASP increased 7.4% year over year. International contribution profit margin of 4.7% exceeded our 2.3% guidance, also due to the timing of content deals. For Q4, we forecast global net adds of 6.30m (1.25m in the US and 5.05m internationally) vs. 7.05m in the year ago quarter (which was our all-time high for quarterly net adds). We recently announced price adjustments in many markets to our HD and 4K video plans while keeping our SD plan mostly unchanged (still $7.99 in the US, for instance). Existing members will be notified and their prices will be adjusted on a rolling basis over the next few months. Increased revenue over time will help us grow our content offering and continue our global operating margin growth. We’ve been focused on growing global operating margin as our primary profitability metric since hitting our 2020 US contribution margin goal of 40% this past Q1. This allows us to avoid near term optimization for specific domestic or international contribution margin targets which could impede our long term growth. For instance, we anticipate our Q4’17 US contribution margin will be 34.4% (a decline both year-on-year and sequentially) as we boost our marketing investment against a growing content slate. We spend disproportionately in the US to generate media and influencer awareness for our programming which we believe, in turn, is an effective way to facilitate word of mouth globally. In our international segment, we are on track to generate positive contribution profit for the full year. As we move into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing operating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the rest of the world. 2Content Five years ago, we embarked on our original programming strategy and we’re very pleased with our progress in transforming Netflix from a service with not just second run content but also must-see new releases, like Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Fuller House, Making a \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Murderer, Narcos, The Crown and 13 Reasons Why, among many others. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b This quarter, we launched several new series such as the gritty drama Ozark and comedy Friends from \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b College by Nick Stoller as well as Marvel’s The Defenders and returning seasons of fan favorites like \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Narcos and Fuller House. We’re also making good strides on original films (as measured by member \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b viewing relative to our investment) with the debut of Death Note (based on the popular Japanese IP), \\u200b \\u200b Naked (a romantic comedy featuring Marlon Wayans) and To the Bone (an intense drama starring Lily \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Collins). Investors often ask us about continued access to content from diversified media companies. While we have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear. Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes. Our investment in Netflix originals is over a quarter of our total P&L content budget in 2017 and will continue to grow. With $17 billion in content commitments over the next several years and a growing library of owned content ($2.5 billion net book value at the end of the quarter), we remain quite comfortable with our ability to please our members around the world. We’ll spend $7-8 billion on content (on a P&L basis) in 2018. Just as we moved from second-run content to licensed originals and then to Netflix-produced originals, we are progressing even further up the value chain to work directly with talented content creators. In August, we announced an overall deal with Shonda Rhimes, the creator of global smash hits like Grey’s \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Anatomy, How to Get Away with Murder, Scandal, and others. We also acquired Millarworld, our one \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b M&A transaction in our 20 year history, the home of legendary comic book writer Mark Millar. Our goal is to work with the best creators in the world and own the underlying intellectual property so that we can continue to deliver amazing content to our members across the globe. In working with the best talent, we strive hard for awards recognition. At this year’s Primetime Emmys, we scored 20 wins out of 92 nominations, second only to HBO, spread across eight different titles. Competition Since 2013, we’ve taken the Long Term View that we’re in the early stages of the worldwide, \\u200b \\u200b multi-decade transition from linear TV to internet entertainment. Recently, it’s been unfolding right before our eyes: Disney announced plans to launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and its other \\u200b \\u200b brands, cable network owners are licensing their channels to virtual MVPDs like Hulu, YouTube, Sling TV, and DirecTV Now, CBS’ All Access is expanding internationally, Apple is reportedly planning on spending \\u200b \\u200b $1 billion on original content and Amazon is streaming NFL games while its Prime Video service has gone global. Facebook launched its Watch tab for original videos. \\u200b \\u200b 3At the same time, linear TV networks like MTV, A&E and WGN are cutting down on scripted series. Last \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b year, the number of original scripted series on linear TV (across broadcast, premium and basic cable) began to decrease as online services ramped up activity. It’s an exciting period and both media and technology companies see the same big opportunity as we do. We have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible to please our members by earning their viewing time and to stay ahead of the competition in the decades to come. Product and Partnerships Ironically, as linear networks move outside of the traditional bundle and into direct-to-consumer applications, we are working more closely than ever with MVPDs/ISPs and other distributors. Building on our Q2 partnership with SFR/Altice in France, where Netflix is sold in a package with high speed Internet and TV services, and an earlier, comparable partnership with Proximus of Belgium, this past quarter we announced the bundling of Netflix into T-Mobile’s ONE family plan. Our partners are enthusiastic about \\u200b \\u200b the response to these bundles as the excitement around our big content enhances their offerings. Our goal with all of our partnerships is to make it easy for members to sign up, pay and enjoy Netflix. We are pleased with the early results and we will continue pursuing these bundling opportunities as a complement to our core direct-to-consumer approach. Free Cashflow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$465 million vs. -$506 million last year and -$608 million in Q2’17. There is no change to our expectation for FCF of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. Negative FCF, despite growing operating income, is due to growth of our content spend, original content in particular, where we pay for the titles before consumers enjoy the content, and the asset is amortized by estimated viewing over time. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market as our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms and partnerships for streaming our service; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.

       "  \"We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than doubled global operating income. . Q4 Results Average paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in ASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5% margin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating margin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year. EPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items that affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which partially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform. In Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last year’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet entertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based. In the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3 million. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although contribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the marketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter. Internationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record for quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue and ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments in a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017 (4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution profit in our history. We took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected expense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger than expected member growth and the timing of international content spend. Forecast The guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net adds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally. As we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year 2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year. We believe our big investments in content are paying off. In 2017, average streaming hours per membership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more revenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018. 2Big hits like 13 Reasons Why, Stranger Things and Bright result from a combination of great content and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b great marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about $1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content, and we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll grow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018. Content Q4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of The Crown and Black \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Mirror as well as Stranger Things, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon. In the quarter, we \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b also successfully launched new titles like the limited series Godless, Marvel’s The Punisher and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Mindhunter (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s \\u200b amazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had three of the Top \\u200b 5 most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row. \\u200b Our largest investment in original films to date, Bright, a fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a \\u200b \\u200b major success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, Bright has become one of our \\u200b \\u200b most viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well as additional investment in original films. We’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of Club de \\u200b Cuervos as well as The Day I Met El Chapo, both of which are from Mexico; Suburra from Italy; and an \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b unscripted series from the UK, Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father. We also debuted Dark, our first \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b German original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for instance, Dark, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions \\u200b \\u200b of members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with attractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this initiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland, India, Korea and Japan. We are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall deals with Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy and Orange is the New Black and GLOW creator Jenji \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Kohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over the world. Product and Partnerships We are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our mutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix, while our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of these types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche Telekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC removed the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net 3neutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the FCC’s action. Competition We have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend becomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On the commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with Apple Music or with iOS. Facebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their multi-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for entertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix. Traditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring most of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand and great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower end of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of content payments, which will now occur in 2018. Our operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is content. When we develop a title like Bright, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated \\u200b \\u200b membership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for self-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend will turn our business FCF positive. In the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re growing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had planned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018. Given our track record of content investments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the increased investments we are making in original content this year. We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of interest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to grow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt. High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick. 4Board of Directors We are pleased to add Rodolphe Belmer to our board of directors. Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+ \\u200b \\u200b Group in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing percentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our board. Summary Our goal is to entertain people.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our investments in marketing, technology and 5development, and content, including original content; content and product partnerships; impact of U.S. net neutrality rules; growth of internet video and competitive landscape; future capital raises; expectations of positive free cash flow, impact of the new limitation on the deductibility of interest; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

       "  'We strive to entertain and to bring joy to people across the world through amazing stories. Our 125 million members provided us with $3.6 billion in streaming revenue in Q1. Our job is to spend this money wisely to increase our members’ delight. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Revenue grew 43% year over year in Q1, the fastest pace in the history of our streaming business, due to a 25% increase in average paid streaming memberships and a 14% rise in ASP. Operating margin of 12% rose 232 bps year over year. This was higher than our beginning of quarter guidance, due primarily to the timing of content spend. Diluted EPS of $0.64 vs. $0.40 included a $41m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. Global net adds totaled a new Q1-record of 7.41m, up 50% year over year and ahead of our 6.35m forecast. The variance relative to our guidance was driven by continued strong acquisition trends across the globe which we attribute to the growing breadth of our content and the worldwide adoption of internet entertainment. In the US, we added 1.96m memberships (compared with forecast of 1.45m). We completed our price adjustment during this past quarter, resulting in 12% ASP growth for the domestic segment. Outside of the US, membership grew by 5.46m (vs. forecast of 4.90m). Our international segment now accounts for 50% of revenue and 55% of memberships. Excluding a F/X impact of +$114 million, international revenue and ASP rose 59% and 13% year over year, respectively. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2, we expect 6.2 million global net additions (1.2m in the US and 5.0m for the international segment) vs. 5.2 million in the year ago quarter. Q2 operating margin is expected to be 12%. We are now targeting a full year operating margin of 10%-11%. We continue to anticipate content and marketing spend to be weighted towards the second half of 2018. Content We’ll have $7.5-$8 billion of content expense (on a P&L basis) in 2018 across a wide variety of formats (series, films, unscripted, docs, comedy specials, non-English language) to serve the diverse tastes of our growing global membership base. Q1 scripted original series debuts included the dark, coming of age story The End of the F***ing World \\u200b and sci-fi thriller Altered Carbon as well as returning seasons of Marvel’s Jessica Jones, Grace and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b Frankie, Santa Clarita Diet and A Series of Unfortunate Events. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Last year, we expanded our efforts in original programming to unscripted shows across several genres. Our output in this area is now comparable to similarly-focused US domestic cable networks. Shows like Queer Eye and Nailed It are great examples of our ambitions in this area: engaging, buzz-worthy shows \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b that drive lots of enjoyment around the world. Our investment in international production continued to increase with big, non-English originals like O \\u200b Mecanismo (The Mechanism). Loosely inspired by real events and from Narcos creator José Padilha, this \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b drama is tracking to be one of our most viewed originals in Brazil. We are also seeing more examples of non-English content transcending borders. This quarter, La Casa de Papel (Money Heist in English \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 2language territories), a Spanish language heist thriller, became the most watched non-English series on Netflix ever. On Super Bowl Sunday, we surprise-announced and launched The Cloverfield Paradox, the third film in \\u200b \\u200b the Cloverfield franchise. Through tight coordination among our original film, product, marketing and PR \\u200b \\u200b teams, the event showcased how a big branded film can be marketed and delivered to consumers instantaneously across the globe without a wait for the theatrical window. Outside of North America, we premiered the Alex Garland-directed Annihilation, starring Natalie Portman, just weeks after its US \\u200b \\u200b theatrical debut and it has enjoyed large audiences in nearly every country for us. We also released a broad range of original films: from Benji for kids and families; to the Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg \\u200b \\u200b produced comedy Game Over, Man; to the Sundance hip-hop biopic Roxanne, Roxanne. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b We regret our films not being able to compete at this year’s Cannes film festival. The festival adopted a new rule that means if a film is in competition at Cannes, it can not be watched on Netflix in France for the following three years1. We would never want to do that to our French members. We will continue to celebrate our films and filmmakers at other festivals around the world but unfortunately we will have to sit out Cannes for now so that our growing French membership can continue to enjoy our original films. This past quarter, we signed an overall deal with Ryan Murphy, the prolific hit-maker behind American \\u200b Crime Story: The People vs. OJ Simpson, Nip/Tuck, Glee, American Horror Story and many others. This \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b comes on the heels of similar partnerships with Shonda Rhimes, Shawn Levy and Jenji Kohan. While these overall deals are a substantial investment for us, they allow us to work directly with prolific and talented creators with a proven track record of success. Instead of having to license their shows for a finite period from outside suppliers, we will own the projects we produce with them. This approach also allows us to reduce our reliance on third-party studios and forego the corresponding license premiums we’ve historically paid. We were proud to celebrate our first feature Academy Award with Bryan Fogel and Dan Cogan, makers of our documentary Icarus. We’re thrilled when the creators with whom we partner are recognized for \\u200b \\u200b their exceptional work. The Oscar win helps to reinforce that Netflix is a great home for both documentary lovers and creators. Marketing We’re investing in more marketing of new original titles to create more density of viewing and conversation around each title (i.e bigger hit in a nation or demographic). We believe this density of viewing helps on both retention and acquisition, because it makes our original titles even less substitutable. Because we operate in so many countries, we are able to try different approaches in different markets, and continue to learn. 1 Specifically, the Cannes festival’s new rule is that a French theatrical opening is required of films in competition, and French \\u200b law in essence requires that if a film is in French theatres, then it cannot be on an SVOD service in France for 36 months. While in other countries we can offer simultaneous exhibition in theatres and on Netflix, that is not permitted in France, so we have to be Netflix-only for our films in France. 3Product and Partnerships Last year, we launched bundle offers with Proximus (in Belgium), SFR Altice (France) and T-Mobile (US). They have proven to be very successful and we are now adding similar bundle offers with additional MVPD partners. Recently, we announced that we are bundling the Netflix service with packages from Sky which will begin later this year and with Comcast in the US, which are currently being rolled out. These relationships allow our partners to attract more customers and to upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while we benefit from more reach, awareness and often, less friction in the signup and payment process. We believe that the lower churn in these bundles offsets the lower Netflix ASP. We remain primarily a direct-to-consumer business, but we see our bundling initiative as an attractive supplemental channel. In March, we rolled out additional features providing members with greater information and control \\u200b \\u200b over their Netflix viewing. While we had already offered PIN protection for all content at a certain maturity level, there is now a parental PIN control for individual movies and shows. These new features are part of our ongoing effort to give our members tools to manage how they and their families enjoy Netflix. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q1 was -$287 million (less negative than we expected due to content payment timing differences), compared with -$524 million in Q4’17. We continue to forecast free cash flow of -$3 to -$4 billion in 2018, and to be free cash flow negative for several more years as our original content spend rapidly grows. We have about $2.6 billion in cash and we will continue to raise debt as needed to fund our increase in original content. Our debt levels are quite modest as a percentage of our enterprise value, and we believe the debt is lower cost of capital compared to equity. Board of Directors We’re pleased to add Ambassador Susan Rice to our board of directors. Susan is a former National \\u200b \\u200b Security Advisor and United States Ambassador to the United Nations. As a global company operating in over 190 countries, Susan’s expertise in international affairs will be valuable.

       "  \"We had a strong but not stellar Q2, ending with 130 million memberships. Membership growth was 5.2m, the same as Q2 last year, but lower than our 6.2m forecast. Earnings, margins, and revenue were all in-line with forecast and way up from prior year. Internet video is growing globally and we are fortunate to be one of the leaders. In addition to succeeding commercially, we are starting to lead artistically in some categories, with our creators earning enough Emmy nominations this year to collectively break HBO’s amazing 17-year run. \\u200b \\u200b Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Streaming revenue in Q2 rose 43% year over year, driven by a 26% and 14% increase in average paid memberships and ASP, respectively. Operating margin of 11.8% expanded 720 bps year over year, resulting in 262% growth in operating income. EPS of $0.85 vs. $0.15 included an $85 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy, meaning in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance. This Q2, we over-forecasted global net additions which amounted to 5.2m vs. a forecast of 6.2m and flat compared to Q2 a year ago, as acquisition growth was slightly lower than we projected. Paid net adds totaled 5.5m in Q2, compared with 4.7m last year and forecast of 6.1m. US net adds of 0.7m (vs. guidance of 1.2m) were down vs. last year’s Q2-record 1.1m, but consistent with previous Q2 performance (0.5m in Q2’12, 0.6m in Q2’13, 0.6m in Q2’14, 0.9m in Q2’15, and 0.2m in Q2’16). Through the first six months of the year, our US net adds are slightly ahead of last year. Internationally, 4.5m net additions grew 8% year over year on broad market growth. Currency had a +$65 million impact on international revenue year over year (+13% international ASP growth on a FX neutral basis), but this positive impact was smaller than we had forecast 90 days ago as the US dollar strengthened meaningfully against many currencies since our Q1’18 earnings report in April. As a \\u200b reminder, we do not hedge our revenue with derivatives. Faster growth in international markets relative to the US creates a net revenue exposure to non-USD currencies. With the growth of our content production in 80 countries and expanding, we’ll move more of our operating costs to non-USD to provide a little more natural hedging but we anticipate we’ll still 2continue to have much more expense in USD than revenue. We slowly adjust pricing over time to mitigate forex moves over the longer term, but when currency movements are rapid, they will affect our near term operating margin. We’ll tend to outperform our near term operating margin targets on dollar weakness and underperform on dollar strength. For the full year 2018, current F/X rates have pushed our expectations on operating margin to be near the lower end of our 10-11% target range. We continue to expect steady growth in operating margin in 2019 and beyond. For Q3, we forecast global net adds of 5.0m (compared with 5.3m in Q3’17), with 0.65m and 4.35m in the US and international segment, respectively. Paid net adds are forecast to be 5.2m, up from 5.0m in Q3’17. Content Our broad slate of programming in Q2 highlights the diversity of programming we are providing. We debuted sci-fi action series Lost in Space, which we’ve renewed for another season. In addition, we \\u200b \\u200b released the second season of one of our biggest originals 13 Reasons Why, as well as Santa Clarita Diet, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b A Series of Unfortunate Events, Marvel’s Jessica Jones, La Casa de Papel (Money Heist), GLOW and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Marvel’s Luke Cage. In original kids programming, Boss Baby: Back in Business became one of our \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b biggest kids series ever. We continue to ramp up our production of non-English originals. In Q2, we debuted season 2 of 3%, our \\u200b \\u200b sci-fi original from Brazil and premiered The Rain, our Danish original thriller which became one of our \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b biggest non-English original productions yet, with viewing all over the world. This serves as another data point that our international originals can be important to specific countries and regions and also play well outside of their home markets. Late in the quarter, we launched Lust Stories, a new Indian original \\u200b \\u200b film, which has been a major success as our largest watched original in percentage terms in any individual market in its first month. Sacred Games, our first Indian original series, launched on July 6 and \\u200b \\u200b is off to a similarly strong start. We will follow Sacred Games up in India with Ghoul on August 24. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b We were honored last week with the most Emmy nominations of any network. The 112 Netflix nominations include five best series and best limited series nominations and are spread across 40 different scripted and unscripted series, TV movies, limited series, documentaries, talk shows, comedy specials and series for kids. This is a testament to the fantastic creators we work with across all forms of television. We are making good progress with our original feature films. As traditional exhibition focuses increasingly on superheroes and sequels, our on demand service allows us to serve a wide variety of tastes. For example, in Q2, we had success with several romantic comedies such as Set It Up, starring \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Lucy Liu, Zoey Deutch, Taye Diggs and Glen Powell and The Kissing Booth, which peaked at #4 on IMDB’s \\u200b \\u200b chart of most popular movies, behind only Deadpool 2, The Avengers: Infinity War and Solo: A Star Wars \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Story. Kissing Booth and Set it Up have been watched and loved by tens of millions of Netflix members \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and the young stars of these films have seen their social media followings grow from a few thousand into the millions in the weeks following release. Of course, we also produce big event movies as well and we recently announced that Michael Bay, one of the most commercially successful action directors, will make his next film, Six Underground (starring Ryan Reynolds) for Netflix. Bay joins Martin Scorsese, \\u200b \\u200b 3Alfonso Cuaron, Susanne Bier, Paul Greengrass, Chris Columbus and many other top directors who are making their next feature films for Netflix. Product and Partnerships We continue to invest in our mobile experience. Last week, we unveiled our “Smart Downloads” feature on Android for members that use our offline mode, which is particularly popular in emerging markets. Now, when members finish watching a downloaded episode, it will be automatically deleted and the next episode will be automatically downloaded. Smart Downloads works only when the device is connected to WiFi so cellular data plans won’t be used and device storage won’t be affected since the last watched episode will always be deleted first before the next episode is downloaded. Members also have the option to toggle this feature on and off. We are expanding our partner-based bundle offerings, announcing deals with Telefonica in Spain and Latin America as well as KDDI in Japan. While the majority of our acquisition happens by consumers signing up with us directly, bundles continue to be a high-performing additional acquisition channel. We expect to continue to add such deals with partners around the world. Competition YouTube and Netflix are two leading global (ex-China) internet entertainment services. HBO and Disney are evolving to focus on internet entertainment services. Amazon and Apple are investing in content as part of larger ecosystem subscriptions. Each of these firms has unique content and is striving to find the best creators from around the world to entertain its viewers. There has never been a better time to be a creator or consumer of content. We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties to have attractive offerings. We anticipate more competition from the combined AT&T/Warner Media, from the combined Fox/Disney or Fox/Comcast as well as from international players like Germany’s ProSieben and Salto in France. Our strategy is to simply keep improving, as we’ve been doing every year \\u200b \\u200b in the past. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q2 totaled -$559 million vs. -$608 million in the year ago quarter. We continue to anticipate FCF of -$3 to -$4 billion for the full year 2018, which implies that our content cash spending will be weighted to the second half of 2018. During Q2, we completed our latest bond deal, raising $1.9 billion. At the end of Q2, our gross debt balance stood at $8.4 billion and we had a cash balance of $3.9 billion and a $500 million undrawn credit facility. Our debt-to-EV is currently about 5%. While interest rates have risen and the federal tax rate is now lower (reducing the tax shield on interest costs), we judge that our after-tax cost of debt continues to be lower than our cost of equity, so we anticipate that we’ll continue to finance our capital needs in the high yield market. 4Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: April 2018, January 2018, October 2017, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b July 2017, April 2017, January 2017, October 2016, July 2016. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Earnings Interview, 3pm PST, July 16, 2018 Our video interview with Todd Juenger of Bernstein will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm PST today. \\u200b \\u200b Questions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to todd.juenger@bernstein.com.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       "  \"Our broad slate of original programming helped drive a solid quarter of growth with streaming revenue increasing 36% year over year and global membership surpassing 130 million paid and 137 million total. We’re thrilled to be growing internet entertainment across the globe. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Streaming revenue grew 36% year over year in Q3, as average paid membership increased 25% and ASP rose 8%. International revenue included a -$90 million year over year impact from currency. Excluding the impact of F/X, international ASP rose 11% year over year and 2% sequentially. Operating margin expanded 500 bps year over year to 12%. This exceeded our forecast of 10.5% due to the timing of content and marketing spend, a portion of which moved into Q4. EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.29 last year included an $8 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond and a $38 million tax benefit related to adjustments to the transition tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets (both related to true-ups from the 2017 US tax reform). As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy in our forecast. This means in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance. This quarter, we under-forecasted memberships. Total net additions of 7.0m (up 31% vs. 5.3m last year) was higher than our forecast of 5.0m, and represented a new Q3 record. The variance relative to forecast was due to greater-than-expected acquisition globally, with strong growth broadly across all our markets including Asia. For Q4, we forecast paid net additions of 7.6m, and total net additions of 9.4m, up 15% and 13% compared with 6.6m and 8.3m in Q4 last year. We’re still targeting operating margin to be at the lower end of the 10%-11% range for the full year 2018. This means that in Q4 we expect operating margin will dip to 5% from 7.5% in the year ago quarter. As we have written in previous letters, this sequential decline in operating margin in the second half of 2018 is due to the timing of content spend and a higher mix of original films in Q4’18 (film amortization is more accelerated than series amortization due to more front-loaded viewing). We would have preferred our operating margin to have been a little steadier over the course of the year, and we will target a little less quarterly variance next year in our progress to our full year target of 13% (assuming no major FX moves). Next quarter, we expect to reclassify certain personnel costs from G&A to Content and Marketing, and from Technology & Development to Other Cost of Revenues. This change would reflect the ongoing evolution of our business to include self-production of content. A growing number of employees are becoming involved in developing content as we migrate to self-produce more of our content vs. only licensing original and non-original content. We expect to make the same change with marketing and other tech employee costs to maintain consistency in approach. The change would result in a comprehensive view of our total spending on content and marketing. This reclassification would have no impact on total operating expenses, operating profit or operating margin. If enacted, we will provide quarterly pro-formas so investors will see the change cleanly. Evolving to Paid Membership Focus The chart below illustrates our weekly paid net additions (on the right) and total net additions (on the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b left, which includes paid + free) over the last several years. Paid net adds are more steady, as total net additions can be skewed by free trials of varying quality. This skew adds noise to our membership 2forecasts in a way that isn’t material to revenue or the business. In comparison, paid net adds are a more reliable indicator of revenue growth. Because growth in paid memberships is more steady, our forecast for paid net adds has been historically more accurate than our total net adds forecast. For example in Q2’18, our paid net adds forecast was off by 11% compared to a 17% variance for total net adds forecast. In addition, we are learning that no free trial may result in greater revenue in some markets, so free trial count at the end of a quarter will likely be a less insightful predictor of future growth than in the past. As a result, starting with our earnings report in January 2019, we’ll only guide to paid memberships; a year after that, in 2020, we’ll cease reporting on end-of-quarter free trial count. We will show the weekly paid net adds graph, as above on the right, in each earnings letter going forward. We expect this additional disclosure will be helpful to your understanding of our business, in particular, how steady our paid membership growth is in the near term. Content We have three major categories of content: licensed non-first-window content such as Shameless, \\u200b \\u200b licensed original first-window content such as Orange is the New Black (owned and developed by \\u200b \\u200b Lionsgate), and now owned original first-window content from the Netflix studio, such as Stranger \\u200b Things. Within those categories there are lots of subdivisions and per-territory treatments, but those are \\u200b the big three buckets. It was just two years ago when we began building the third category: a film and TV studio within Netflix. Some of our notable owned-titles in addition to Stranger Things include: Big Mouth, The Ranch, Bright, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Godless, The Kissing Booth, 3%, Dark, Sacred Games and Nailed It. In addition to reducing our reliance on \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b outside studios, this initiative provides us with greater control over the content we create (e.g., long term global rights), the ability to strengthen title-brand-love and franchise value (like consumer products) and potentially lower costs (as we can avoid the markup 3rd party studios charge us). To do this, we’ve had to develop new capabilities to manage the entire production process from creative support, production planning, crew and vendor management to visual effects, to name a few. 3Today, we employ hundreds of people in physical production, working on a wide variety of owned titles spread across scripted and unscripted series, kids, international content, standup, docs and feature films from all over the world. To support our efforts, we’ll need more production capacity; we recently announced the selection of Albuquerque, New Mexico as the site of a new US production hub, where we \\u200b \\u200b anticipate bringing $1 billion dollars in production over the next 10 years and creating up to 1,000 production jobs per year. Our internal studio is already the single largest supplier of content to Netflix (on a cash basis). We strive to offer a wide breadth of programming because we want to maximize the size of our membership base and people have very diverse tastes that we seek to satisfy. This also reduces our dependence on any individual title. Even our largest titles, which are viewed by tens of millions of our members, only account for a low single digit percentage of total streaming hours. Therefore, the vast majority of our growth in any given quarter is not attributable to any one piece of content, as you can see by the steadiness in our paid net additions. This past quarter, in original series, we launched new seasons of Orange is the New Black, Ozark, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Marvel’s Luke Cage and debuted Insatiable. Late in the quarter, we released Maniac, a limited series \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill. We have also been ramping up our animated adult comedy offering. In Q3, we successfully premiered Disenchantment, from Matt Groening who created The \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Simpsons and Futurama, and Paradise PD, from the makers of Brickleberry, to complement Big Mouth, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Bojack Horseman and F is for Family. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b We also continue to expand our international originals, with projects spanning India, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and throughout the Middle East to just name a few. In India, our hit series Sacred Games was followed up by Ghoul in late August. La Casa de las Flores, our latest \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Mexican original, has become a big hit. As part of our Summer of Love and building on the success of Set It Up and The Kissing Booth, we \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b released original films Like Father (starring Kristen Bell and Kelsey Grammer in a daughter-father \\u200b \\u200b dramedy), Sierra Burgess Is a Loser (starring Stranger Things’ Barb, Shannon Purser) and To All the Boys \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b I’ve Loved Before, which is one of our most viewed original films ever with strong repeat viewing. More \\u200b than 80 million accounts have watched one or more of the Summer of Love films globally and we are \\u200b \\u200b already in production for the next set of original rom-coms for our members. This December, we'll be launching ROMA, from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón. We support \\u200b \\u200b simultaneous release in cinema and on Netflix, and the film will debut on Netflix and on over 100 screens worldwide, just as we are doing currently with 22 July, from Oscar-nominated director Paul \\u200b \\u200b Greengrass. We believe in our member-centric simultaneous release model for our original films and welcome additional theatre chains that are open to carrying our films to provide the shared-viewing, big-screen experience to their customers who enjoy that option. We’ve come a long way in the five years since launching original content on Netflix. In addition to our commercial success, we’re ecstatic when the creators we work with are recognized for their inspiring work. This year, Netflix originals led with 112 Emmy nominations spanning 40 of our shows, docs and 4specials across nearly every category and we’re humbled to have tied HBO with the most number of Emmy wins with 23. We’re also thrilled that Netflix has been a launching pad for a new generation of global stars like Millie Bobby Brown, Jacob Elordi, Noah Centineo and Gaten Matarazzo. When our service helps our talent develop huge fan bases (from small followings to over 10 million Instagram followers), we can attract the best talent in the world. This explosive growth in popularity is a good indicator that our shows and stars are breaking out around the planet. More EU content The European Union is currently rewriting its audio visual rules, which will eventually require subscription streaming services to devote a minimum of 30% of their catalog to European works. In addition, some member states are looking to require services like ours to invest some portion of local revenues into European works. We anticipate being able to meet these requirements by evolving our content offering. We are heavily investing around the world to share stories broadly and to strengthen local production capacity and opportunity. We'd prefer to focus on making our service great for our members, which would include producing local content, rather than on satisfying quotas, but we anticipate that a regional content quota which approximates the region's share of our global membership will only marginally reduce member satisfaction. Nonetheless, quotas, regardless of market size, can negatively impact both the customer experience and creativity. We believe a more effective way for a country to support strong local content is to directly incentivize local content creators, independent of distribution channel. 5Product and Partnerships We continue to expand our partnerships with pay TV providers, ISPs and mobile operators across the globe. In Q3, we rolled out the first mobile bundle in Japan with KDDI and expanded our partnership with Verizon to pre-install the Netflix app on Android phones. In Q4, we plan to roll out our previously announced partnership with Sky UK. Competition We compete for entertainment time with linear TV, YouTube, video gaming, web browsing, social media, DVD and PPV, and more. In that competition for screen hours, we lose most of the time, but we win enough to keep growing. As internet entertainment grows, more companies see the large opportunity. Content companies such as WarnerMedia and Disney/Fox are moving to self-distribute their own content; tech firms like Apple, Amazon and others are investing in premium content to enhance their distribution platforms. Amid these massive competitors on both sides, plus traditional media firms, our job is to make Netflix stand out so that when consumers have free time, they choose to spend it with our service. Within linear TV, New Fox appears to have a great strategy, which is to focus on large simultaneous-viewing sports and news. These content areas are not transformed by on-demand viewing and personalization in the way that TV series and movies are, so they are more resistant to the rise of the internet. Other linear networks are likely to follow this model over time. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow in Q3 was -$859 million vs. -$465 million in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, our growing mix of self-produced content, which requires us to fund content during the production phase prior to its release on Netflix, is the primary driver of our working capital needs that creates the gap between our positive net income and our free cash flow deficit. We anticipate that FCF will be closer to -$3 billion than to -$4 billion for the full year 2018. We expect our quarterly FCF deficit will increase sequentially from Q3 to Q4 as our year to date FCF is -$1.7 billion. We currently see next year’s negative FCF as roughly flat with this year. We recognize we are making huge cash investments in content, and we want to assure our investors that we have the same high confidence in the underlying economics as our cash investments in the past. These investments we see as very likely to help us to keep our revenue and operating profits growing for a very long time ahead.

       "  \"We grew annual revenue 35% to $16 billion in 2018, and nearly doubled operating profits to $1.6 billion. Fueling this growth was our high member satisfaction, which propelled us to finish 2018 with 139 million paying memberships, up 9 million from quarter start and up 29 million from the beginning of the year. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Average paid memberships and ASP rose 26% and 3% year over year, respectively. Excluding the impact of F/X, international ASP increased 6% year over year and 1% sequentially. Foreign exchange headwinds continued to move against us in the quarter, similar to the trend we saw in Q3’18. As expected, Q4 operating margin dipped to 5.2% vs. 7.5% prior year due to so many titles launching in the quarter. Our full year 2018 operating margin of 10% was in-line with our target. EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.41 included a $22 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We added a record 8.8m paid memberships (1.5m in the US and 7.3m internationally), higher than our beginning-of-quarter expectation for 7.6m paid net adds and up 33% year over year. For the full year, paid net adds grew 33% to 29m vs. the 22m we added in 2017. 1As discussed in our last letter, we reclassified certain personnel costs from G&A to Cost of Revenues and \\u200b \\u200b Marketing, and from Technology & Development to Other Cost of Revenues. This change has no impact on operating profit or margin or total operating expenses and historical quarterly pro forma financial statements for 2016-2018 can be found here. \\u200b \\u200b The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q1’19, we forecast global paid net additions of 8.9m, +8% year over year, with 1.6m in the US and 7.3m internationally. Our Q1’19 revenue forecast represents 21% year over year growth (27% FX neutral). Our paid member growth is fairly consistent. Quarter to quarter, revenue growth varies due to factors like FX changes and timing of price changes across different markets. For example, we forecast Q1’19 international ASP will be up year over year, excluding FX. We change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience. We want to ensure that Netflix is a good value for the money and that our entry price is affordable. We just increased our US prices for new members, as we did in Q4 in Canada and Argentina, and in Japan in Q3. The new pricing in the US will be phased in for existing members over Q1 and Q2, which we anticipate will lift ASP. Our multi-year plan is to keep significantly growing our content while increasing our revenue faster to expand our operating margins. We’re targeting a 9% operating margin in Q1’19, which we expect will grow over the course of the year and our full year operating margin target for 2019 remains 13% vs. 10% in 2018. A majority of our revenue is not in dollars, so when there are material FX moves, investors know to expect proportionate top line changes. In such FX cases, we’ll seek to adjust our prices and costs over time, but since that will lag the revenue changes, and since we don’t hedge FX, this would lead to short-term margin variations from our steady progression. 2Content In its first 4 weeks on Netflix, we estimate that Bird Box from director Susanne Bier will be enjoyed by \\u200b \\u200b over 80 million member households, and we are seeing high repeat viewing. In combination with our other movie hits such as: Dumplin’ from director Anne Fletcher, Chris Columbus-produced The Christmas \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Chronicles, Alfonso Cuarón’s critically acclaimed ROMA, Paul Greengrass’ 22 July, Tamara Jenkins’ \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Private Life and the Coen brothers’ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, we are beginning to have our original \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b movie offering mirror the success of our series offering for consumer enjoyment. The global reach of our \\u200b audience and the quality of the experience producing for Netflix continues to attract the world’s top directors. We are expanding the film market: while our films drew bigger and bigger audiences in Q4, the North American box office also set records. Today, five weeks after its Netflix debut, ROMA is still \\u200b \\u200b being exhibited in theaters and has played on over 900 unique screens around the world, including some special 70mm format presentations. People love films...at home and in theaters. \\u200b \\u200b Around the world, our titles are not only pleasing consumers, but they are transforming the careers of our talent. Elite, our Spanish original, has been a huge success with over 20 million member households \\u200b \\u200b around the world enjoying the series in its first four weeks on service1. In addition to being highly watched, social engagement has been phenomenal and the cast’s popularity on social media skyrocketed, continuing to demonstrate our ability to be a launching pad for talent. We’re making significant investments in productions all over the world because we have seen that great stories transcend borders. For example, Bodyguard (co-produced with BBC One, from ITV Studios) ranks \\u200b \\u200b as one of our most enjoyed co-productions. Baby, our second original series from Italy, and The \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 1 For series, due to their highly variable length, we count a viewer if they substantially complete at least one episode (70%). For a film, it is if they substantially complete the film (70%). 3Protector, our first Turkish original series, both saw strong viewing both inside and outside their home \\u200b countries. All three of these debut seasons from around the world were each enjoyed by over 10 million member households in their first four weeks. From Hollywood, in Q4 we launched new global scripted series like The Haunting of Hill House, Chilling \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Adventures of Sabrina, and The Kominsky Method (from Chuck Lorre, starring Michael Douglas and Alan \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Arkin), as well as new seasons of returning shows like adult animation Big Mouth and Narcos: Mexico, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b the latest installment in the Narcos franchise. We were very pleased with our launch of You three weeks \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b ago; we estimate it will be watched by over 40 million member households in its first 4 weeks on Netflix. This binge-worthy show started as a Lifetime linear series in the US, but is now a full Netflix global original. A week ago, we launched Sex Education from the UK and it is also tracking to be a huge hit \\u200b \\u200b (estimated over 40 million households watching the title within the first 4 weeks). Netflix films and TV shows picked up five 2019 Golden Globe wins, including Best Comedy Series for The \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Kominsky Method and Best Actor in a Comedy Series for Michael Douglas and Best Actor in a Drama \\u200b Series for Richard Madden from Bodyguard. Alfonso Cuarón won the Golden Globe for Best Feature \\u200b \\u200b Director and Best Foreign Language Feature for ROMA. \\u200b \\u200b As a result of our success with original content, we’re becoming less focused on 2nd run programming. For example, we launched our originals strategy for the unscripted genre only two years ago. Today, Netflix originals, like Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, account for a majority of total unscripted view share \\u200b \\u200b on Netflix, while viewing of all unscripted programming has increased meaningfully during that time. We are ready to pay top-of-market prices for second run content when the studios, networks and producers are willing to sell, but we are also prepared to keep our members ecstatic with our incredible original content if others choose to retain their content for their own services. Looking forward in 2019, we will be launching many new highly-anticipated titles including The Umbrella \\u200b Academy (February 15th); Triple Frontier from J.C. Chandor (March); The Irishman from Martin Scorsese; \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 6 Underground from Michael Bay; and The Politician from Ryan Murphy; as well as returning seasons of \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b The Crown led by a new cast including Olivia Colman, Ben Daniels, and Helena Bonham Carter; 13 \\u200b \\u200b Reasons Why, La Casa de Papel, Elite, and, of course, Season 3 of the epic Stranger Things, coming to \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b members all around the world on July 4th. Product and Partnerships We test many different approaches to our business in order to learn how to grow quickly. We continue to test new plan options (both below and above our existing offers) in certain markets. We are also expanding our bundled offerings which now include: Telefonica in Spain, Comcast and T-Mobile in the US, Sky in the UK and Germany, Free in France, and KDDI in Japan. As discussed in our Q1’18 investor letter, in the case of these hard bundles, we report revenue net of economics we share with our partners. On December 28, we released Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, our first interactive movie for adults, \\u200b \\u200b allowing viewers to make decisions on behalf of the lead character. We’ve created thousands of different pathways to make it through the story, including multiple endings. This level of complexity 4necessitated the creation of a system to make such storytelling manageable. “Branch Manager” helped series creator and writer Charlie Brooker and our internal teams produce this popular multi-branched movie. We’ll be using Branch Manager to construct additional interactive projects going forward. We’re thrilled with the global excitement that Bandersnatch has created and it serves as a strong example of \\u200b \\u200b how we can marry technology and entertainment to evolve video storytelling. Competition In the US, we earn around 10% of television screen time2 and less than that of mobile screen time. In other countries, we earn a lower percentage of screen time due to lower penetration of our service. We earn consumer screen time, both mobile and television, away from a very broad set of competitors. We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few \\u200b \\u200b minutes in October, our viewing and signups spiked for that time. Hulu is small compared to YouTube for viewing time, and they are successful in the US, but non-existent in Canada, which creates a comparison point: our penetration in the two countries is pretty similar. There are thousands of competitors in this highly-fragmented market vying to entertain consumers and low barriers to entry for those with great experiences. Our growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen time experiences from which consumers choose. Our focus is not on Disney+, Amazon or others, but on how we can improve our experience for our members. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q4’18 was -$1.3 billion vs. -$0.5 billion in Q4’17, totalling -$3 billion for 2018 (compared to our original forecasted range of -$3 to -$4 billion for the full year). We expect 2019 FCF will be similar to 2018 and then will improve each year thereafter (assuming, as we do, no material transactions). This FCF improvement will be driven by growing operating margin, which will allow us to fund more of our investment needs internally. During Q4, we raised 1.1 billion 4.625% senior notes and $800 million 6.375% senior notes (weighted € average coupon of 5.3%). As long as we judge our marginal after-tax cost of debt to be lower than our marginal cost of equity, we’ll continue to finance our working capital needs through the high yield market. We finished the year with cash of $3.8 billion and our $500 million unsecured credit facility remains undrawn. Spence Neumann joins as CFO We’re pleased that Spence Neumann has joined Netflix as our new CFO and we thank David Wells for his many contributions to Netflix. Spence is a veteran entertainment executive who brings a wealth of experience and new perspectives to the company as we expand our original content around the world. 2 We serve on average about 100 million hours a day to television screens in the US, and we estimate television screens in the US are on about a billion hours daily (120m homes x 2 TVs x 4 hours, plus hotels, bars, etc). 5Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2018, July 2018, April 2018, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b January 2018, October 2017, July 2017, April 2017, January 2017. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Appendix January 17, 2019 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST Our video interview with Eric Sheridan of UBS will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm PST today.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity 6metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding content investment; multi-year business plan; content performance; price changes; reliance on 2nd \\u200b run programming; future content offerings, including \\u200b interactive projects; partnerships; effect of competition on growth; free cash flow; future capital raises; domestic and international net and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of internet service providers; changes in government regulation; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 5, 2018. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter. 7Netflix, Inc.

       "  'Revenue surpassed $4.5 billion in Q1 and we recorded the highest quarterly paid net adds in our history (9.6m, up 16% year over year). For 20 years, we’ve had the same strategy: when we please our members, they watch more and we grow more. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast In Q1’19, average streaming paid memberships increased 26% year over year, while ARPU decreased 2% year over year due to currency headwinds. Excluding F/X, global streaming ARPU improved 3% year over year and 2% sequentially. Year over year total revenue growth of 22% compares against 40% in Q1’18, which benefited from several price changes that took place in Q4’17 as well as F/X. On a F/X-neutral basis, Q1’19 revenue grew 28% year over year. Operating margin of 10.2% exceeded our beginning-of-quarter expectation as some spending was shifted from Q1 to later in the year. EPS of $0.76, vs. $0.64 in the prior year period, included a $58 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming content obligations dipped sequentially in Q1 due in part to the timing of run-of-series commitments. In addition, as we shift to more original content, there will be greater variability in content obligations 1quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of when productions start. We early-adopted the new content accounting standard (ASU 2019-2) in Q1’19. There is no material impact as our content accounting policies are already consistent with the new rules. Paid net adds in Q1 were 9.6 million (with 1.74m in the US and 7.86m internationally), up 16% year over year, representing a new quarterly record. As always, our quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2’19, we project total paid net adds of 5.0m (-8% year over year), with 0.3m in the US and 4.7m for the international segment. This would put us at 14.6m paid net adds for the first half of 2019, up 7% year over year. We’re working our way through a series of price increases in the US, Brazil, Mexico and parts of Europe. The response in the US so far is as we expected and is tracking similarly to what we saw in Canada following our Q4’18 increase, where our gross additions are unaffected, and we see some modest short-term churn effect as members consent to the price change. We’re looking forward to a strong slate of global content in the second half of the year, including new seasons of some of our biggest series, Stranger Things (July 4th), 13 Reasons Why, Orange is the New Black, The Crown and La Casa de \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b Papel (aka Money Heist) as well as big films like Michael Bay’s Six Underground and Martin Scorsese’s \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b The Irishman, and expect another year of record annual paid net adds in 2019. \\u200b We forecast an acceleration in both streaming ARPU (+2% vs. -2%) and total revenue growth (26% vs. 22%) in Q2 vs. Q1. Excluding currency, we forecast streaming ARPU and total revenue would rise 7% and 32%, respectively in Q2. While there will be some quarter-to-quarter lumpiness in operating margins due to the timing of spending, our full year 2019 operating margin target of 13% is unchanged, which means that we expect operating margin in the second half of the year will be higher than the first half. 2As a result of US tax reform, we took the opportunity to simplify our corporate structure. This will result in a higher effective tax rate in 2019, including an expected effective tax rate of 48% in Q2’19 due to one time discrete events. Longer term, we expect our effective tax rate to trend down toward U.S. federal rates. Content We program Netflix with a wide breadth of content to satisfy the diverse tastes of our nearly 150m paid members and the hundreds of millions of people we hope will one day join Netflix. We continue to see big successes across our programming categories. For Q1’19, in scripted English language TV, we premiered another big hit in Umbrella Academy, based on the comic book by Gerard Way and Gabriel \\u200b \\u200b Bá, which has been watched by 45 million member households in its first four weeks on service. Our original films effort built on the momentum from our Q4 blockbuster Bird Box with Triple Frontier, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b starring Ben Affleck and directed by J.C. Chandor. This action/heist movie has been watched by over 52 million member households in its first four weeks on Netflix. The Highwaymen (starring Kevin Costner \\u200b \\u200b and Woody Harrelson as two lawmen that bring Bonnie and Clyde to justice) is on track to being watched by over 40 million member households in its first month. Our documentary feature FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened has been watched by over 20 \\u200b \\u200b million member households in its first month on Netflix. In early April, we unveiled Our Planet, our most \\u200b \\u200b ambitious entry into the popular nature documentary genre. More than four years in the making and shot in 50 different countries, Our Planet is off to a strong start and is tracking to be one of our most \\u200b \\u200b successful global documentary series launches yet, with over 25 million member households projected to watch in the first month of release. We launched our originals effort for the unscripted genre two years ago with several successful English-language formats like the light hearted cooking competition Nailed It!. We’re building on that \\u200b \\u200b success by launching locally adapted versions in Mexico, France, Germany and Spain. ¡Nailed It!: México \\u200b was the first and launched on February 8, achieving three times more first-month watchers in Mexico than the dubbed US version. Our non-English language originals continue to be successful for us and we recently announced that Bela Bajaria, who has overseen some of our most successful scripted and unscripted titles, will now lead this programming category for original series in LatAm, EMEA and India. We premiered our first large scale Korean original series, Kingdom, in January. This period piece with zombies is our most successful season \\u200b \\u200b one show in Korea to date and has also been watched by millions of members outside of Korea with particularly strong viewing throughout Asia. Durante la Tormenta (aka Mirage) is a successful \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Spanish-language original film that debuted in the quarter and has seen broad viewing across the world. We’re thrilled for the creators of our content when they are recognized for their exceptional work. We’re proud that last year Netflix became the most nominated network at the Emmys and now has tied to become the #2 most nominated studio at the Oscars; we tied for most wins in both, including major 3Oscar wins for Alfonso Cuarón for Best Director and Best Cinematographer for Roma, which also won for \\u200b \\u200b Best Foreign Language Feature. Marketing Our CMO, Kelly Bennett, will be retiring this year after an amazing seven year run. During this time, Kelly was a key contributor to the transformation of Netflix from a primarily domestic service with only 2nd run content to a global service launching an unprecedented amount of original programming and we thank Kelly for his hard work. Ted Sarandos has led content for nearly 20 years here, and is ready to run both content and marketing, so he is leading the search for the new CMO, who will report to him. Product and Partnerships We’ve been expanding our bundling initiative and we are now distributing Netflix through ten different operator bundles across the globe. To date, these bundles have had a positive effect on our business, driving incremental acquisition at similar economics to other partnerships where Netflix is offered ȧ la carte. Later in Q2 we’ll be running a test to improve our UK member experience by releasing weekly top 10 lists of the most popular content on our UK service across various programming categories. For those who want to watch what others are watching, this may make choosing titles even easier. After a few months we’ll decide whether to end or expand the test. Competition Recently, Apple and Disney each unveiled their direct-to-consumer subscription video services. Both companies are world class consumer brands and we’re excited to compete; the clear beneficiaries will be content creators and consumers who will reap the rewards of many companies vying to provide a great video experience for audiences. We don’t anticipate that these new entrants will materially affect our growth because the transition from linear to on demand entertainment is so massive and because of the differing nature of our \\u200b content offerings. We believe we’ll all continue to grow as we each invest more in content and improve \\u200b our service and as consumers continue to migrate away from linear viewing (similar to how US cable networks collectively grew for years as viewing shifted from broadcast networks during the 1980s and 1990s). We believe there is vast demand for watching great TV and movies and Netflix only satisfies a small portion of that demand. Last quarter, we talked about how our streaming hours in the US (our most \\u200b \\u200b mature market) on TV still only represents roughly 10% of total TV usage. We are much smaller and have even more room to grow in other countries and on other devices like mobile. For instance, Sandvine estimates our share of global1 downstream mobile internet traffic is about 2%. 1 The Sandvine data does not include significant data from either China or India. 4Source: Sandvine, The Mobile Internet Phenomena Report (February 2019) Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q1’19 was -$380 million vs. -$237 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow2 totaled -$460 million vs. -$287 million in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, the gap between net income and free cash flow is primarily driven by our investment in originals and self produced content where the cash spending is more front end loaded than for second run licensed programming (where cash payments are generally spread over the term of the license). We now expect 2019 free cash flow deficit to be modestly higher at approximately -$3.5 billion due to higher cash taxes related to the change in our corporate structure and additional investments in real estate and other infrastructure. We’re still expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 and each year thereafter, driven by our growing member base, revenues, and operating margins. There’s no change to our plan to use the high yield market to finance our cash needs. We recently upsized our revolving credit facility from $500 million to $750 million (which remains undrawn) at the same cost and extended the term from 2022 to 2024.

       "  'As expected, revenue growth accelerated 400 basis points to 26%, and operating income increased 53% year over year in Q2. Paid membership grew by 2.7m, less than the 5.5m in Q2 a year ago and our 5.0m forecast. In Q3, we expect to grow by 7m paid memberships, more than the 6.1m in Q3 a year ago. Consumers around the world continue to move from linear television to internet entertainment at a remarkable rate. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Average streaming paid memberships increased 24% year over year, while ARPU increased 3% year over year on a reported basis. Excluding the year over year foreign exchange (F/X) impact on revenue of -$265 million, global streaming ARPU grew 9%, with 12% and 7% ARPU growth in the US and international segments, respectively. Operating margin of 14.3% (up 250 bps year over year) was higher than our beginning-of-quarter forecast as some marketing spend was shifted into the second half of the year. EPS amounted to $0.60 vs. $0.85 and included a $61 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming content obligations decreased 2% sequentially, reflecting our shift to more owned (vs. licensed) content. 1As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We strive for accuracy (not conservatism), which means that in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance. In Q2’19, our membership growth forecast was high. Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases. We don’t believe competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape during Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our over-forecast was in every region). Rather, we think Q2’s content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated. Additionally, Q1 was so large for us (9.6m net adds), there may have been more pull-forward effect than we realized. In prior quarters with over-forecasts, we’ve found that the underlying long-term growth was not affected and staying focused on the fundamentals of our business served us well. Q3 has started with Stranger Things season 3, and the first two weeks of Q3 are strong. In addition to \\u200b \\u200b the recently released season 3 of Stranger Things, our second half content slate includes new seasons of \\u200b \\u200b La Casa de Papel (Money Heist), The Crown, and the final season of the iconic Orange is the New Black as \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b well as big films like The Irishman from Martin Scorsese and action movie 6 Underground (directed by \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds). While our US paid membership was essentially flat in Q2, we expect it to return to more typical growth in Q3, and are seeing that in these early weeks of Q3. We forecast Q3 global paid net adds of 7.0m, up vs. 6.1m in Q3’18, with 0.8m in the US and 6.2m internationally. Our internal forecast still currently calls for annual global paid net adds to be up year over year. There’s no change to our 13% operating margin target for FY19, up 300 basis points year over year. 2Content Our Q2 content slate featured several highly watched titles. We launched Dead to Me, a dramedy \\u200b \\u200b starring 2019 Emmy nominated Best Actress Christina Applegate, which was watched by 30m households in its first four weeks. We’ve renewed this half hour comedy for a second season. We’re also proud of When They See Us, a moving limited series based on the Central Park Five case, from Ava \\u200b \\u200b DuVernay. This powerful story was watched by 25m households in its first four weeks and has stirred a global conversation about race, identity, and criminal justice. When They See Us was also just nominated \\u200b \\u200b for 16 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Limited Series. Our Planet was our most ambitious \\u200b \\u200b undertaking in the documentary category to date and it’s also our highest-watched original docu-series through its first four weeks (33m households) and was just nominated for 10 Emmy Awards. We are making good progress with our original films portfolio with more and more of our films creating larger audiences than our pay 1 licensed movies. At the end of June, we premiered our latest Adam Sandler movie Murder Mystery (also starring Jennifer Aniston), which is the most watched Adam Sandler \\u200b \\u200b Netflix original film to date; over 73m households watched this film in its first four weeks. In Q2, the young adult romantic comedy movie The Perfect Date (featuring Noah Centineo from our big film To All \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b The Boys I’ve Loved Before) was a global hit with 48m households in its first four weeks. Similarly, Ali \\u200b Wong co-starred with Randall Park in Always Be My Maybe (directed by Nahnatchka Khan), which was \\u200b \\u200b viewed by 32m households in its first four weeks. Season 2 of The Rain was among the largest returning seasons for one of our non-English language \\u200b \\u200b originals, while Swedish series Quicksand was a new show that was highly watched both locally and \\u200b \\u200b globally. We also debuted several local-language titles that were very popular in their home territories like the first two installments of the Historia de un Crimen franchise (Historia de un Crimen: Colosio and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 3Historia de un Crimen: Colmenares) in Latin America, while Family Business was a breakthrough hit for us \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b in France. We’ve been moving our content from semi-exclusive catalog and 2nd-window unbranded content to branded exclusive 1st window original content for many years. Much of our domestic, and eventually global, Disney catalog, as well as Friends, The Office, and some other licensed content will wind down \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b over the coming years, freeing up budget for more original content. We don’t have material viewing concentration as even our largest titles (that are watched by millions of members) account for only a low single digit percentage of streaming hours. From what we’ve seen in the past when we drop strong catalog content (Starz and Epix with Sony, Disney, and Paramount films, or 2nd run series from Fox, for example) our members shift over to enjoying our other great content. Forty of our original series, films and specials were nominated for 117 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy and Drama Series, Limited Series, Animated Series and Reality Series, as well as Variety, Children’s, short form and interactive programs. We are incredibly proud to offer best in class original programming in so many different forms. Marketing As Netflix has shifted to original content, our marketing has evolved to increasingly focus on launching our key titles to build excitement amongst existing and non-members. We’re continuing to invest in owned and earned media, where we can have strong, direct relationships with fans. We’re very excited to welcome Jackie Lee-Joe as our new CMO to help us take our marketing to the next level. \\u200b \\u200b We’re also building out our licensing and brand partnerships effort, which is optimizing for fan and viewer engagement over revenue maximization. For example, for the launch of Stranger Things season \\u200b \\u200b 3, we partnered with best-in-class brands like Coke, Nike, Burger King, and Baskin Robbins to build deep \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b connections with our fans. At E3, the largest video gaming event of the year, we announced a new Stranger Things mobile game, a \\u200b \\u200b game based on our upcoming new show Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (a prequel to the 1982 film), \\u200b \\u200b and a partnership with Epic Games, the developers of Fortnite. Like our other merchandising initiatives, \\u200b \\u200b these games are designed to build fandom for our titles and don’t signal a push into gaming as a new business for Netflix. Product and Partnerships We recently entered into a new partnership with AT&T in the US to integrate Netflix into their new set-top box. In the US, we now partner with a wide range of ISPs and MVPDs, including Comcast, DISH, Verizon, T-Mobile, Charter, and Altice, in addition to AT&T. After several months of testing, we’ve decided to roll out a lower-priced mobile-screen plan in India to complement our existing plans. We believe this plan, which will launch in Q3, will be an effective way to introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market where Pay TV ARPU is low (below $5). We will continue to learn more after launch of this plan. 4Competition Over the next 12 months, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, NBCU and others are joining Hulu, Amazon, BBC, Hotstar, YouTube, Netflix, and many others in offering streaming entertainment. The competition for winning consumers’ relaxation time is fierce for all companies and great for consumers. The innovation of streaming services is also drawing consumers to shift more and more from linear television to streaming entertainment. If you watch Our Planet on a new TV with Dolby Vision or HDR10, you will see \\u200b \\u200b why: the quality of streaming television is spectacular. In the US, our most developed market, we still only earn about 10% of consumers’ television time, and less of their mobile screen time, so we have much room for growth. We, like HBO, are advertising free. That remains a deep part of our brand proposition; when you read speculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be confident that this is false. We believe we will have a more valuable business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue and instead entirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q2’19 was -$544 million vs. -$518 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)1 totaled -$594 million vs. -$559 million in Q2’18. We’re still forecasting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion for the full year 2019 and expect improvement in 2020. From there, we’ll continue to reduce our free cash flow deficit as we intend to continue growing our member base, revenues, and operating margin, which provides a clear path towards positive FCF. In the meantime, our plan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments as we did in April. In our most recent round, we raised 10.5 year senior notes of 1.2 billion (3.875% coupon) and $900 million (5.375% € coupon). Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: April 2019, January 2019, October 2018, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b July 2018, April 2018, January 2018, October 2017, July 2017. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5'),\n",
       " ('FINAL-Q3-19-Shareholder-Letter',\n",
       "  \"In Q3, we grew to $5.2 billion in revenue, up 31% over the prior year, and operating income doubled to $1.0 billion. Paid net adds totaled 6.8m compared to our 7.0m forecast and prior year Q3 of 6.1m. As we’ve improved the variety, diversity and quality of our content slate, member engagement has grown, revenue has increased, and we’re able to further fund our content investment. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast In Q3’19, average streaming paid memberships and ARPU grew 22% and 9% year over year, respectively. Excluding a -$137m year over year impact from F/X, consolidated revenue growth was 35%, while streaming ARPU growth was 12%. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above our guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4’19. EPS amounted to $1.47 vs. $0.89 and included a $171 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Our Euro bonds provide us with a small natural hedge for our growing European revenues. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, our guidance forecast was our most accurate in recent history. 1In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. On a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a meaningful impact on paid net adds. However, revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. With more revenue, we’ll continue to invest to improve our service to further strengthen our value proposition. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We’re making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress. For Q4, we’re expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We’re forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. As we outline in more detail below, our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. 2We’re on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we’ll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we’ve delivered each year since 2017. As we’ve said previously, large swings in F/X could lead to some variations from our steady annual margin progression, partially because we don’t buy derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars. Content We strive to program Netflix with the best variety of high quality content across many genres (scripted series, films, docs, comedy specials, unscripted TV, kids & family, anime, etc.). Our ambitious approach reflects our goal to satisfy the entertainment desires of our 158m-plus members and to attract as many of the hundreds of millions of non-members as we can. To accomplish this, we need great breadth of quality content because people have very diverse tastes. If you think about your own habits, you’ll recognize that what you want to watch on a Friday night may differ from what you want to watch on Tuesday after a long day of work or what you want to watch with your family on Saturday morning or what you want to watch with your friends on Sunday afternoon. Now, multiply that by the billions of people on the planet and all the other factors that affect viewing preferences and you will have a sense of the breadth of programming necessary to be as successful as we desire. We have been moving increasingly to original content both because of the anticipated pullback of second run content from some studios and because our original content is working in the form of member viewing and engagement. We started first with English scripted TV series more than six years ago to great success. We continued in Q3 with Stranger Things Season 3 (the most watched season to \\u200b \\u200b date with 64m member households in its first four weeks). We also introduced new limited series like 3Unbelievable, one of our most thought provoking and highly viewed dramas (watched by 32m member \\u200b households in its first 28 days). We’re expanding our non-English language original offerings because they continue to help grow our penetration in international markets. In Q3, Season 3 of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist) became the \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b most watched show on Netflix across our non-English language territories with 44m households watching the new season in the first four weeks of release. Sintonia, our latest Brazilian original, was the \\u200b \\u200b second most watched inaugural season in Brazil. The Naked Director broke out as the biggest title launch \\u200b \\u200b for us in Japan and was also highly successful throughout Asia. Similarly, in India, we debuted the second season of Sacred Games, our most watched show in India. To date, we have globally released 100 \\u200b \\u200b seasons of local language, original scripted series from 17 countries and have plans for over 130 more in 2020. We also plan to expand our investment in local language original films and unscripted series. We’re also investing aggressively in original films and making great progress with improving results. Our original film slate in Q3 featured several solid hits like Secret Obsession (starring Brenda Song) and \\u200b \\u200b Otherhood (directed by Cindy Chupack in her feature directorial debut), which were watched by 40 \\u200b million and 29 million households in their first four weeks, respectively. Tall Girl, a new family film \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b starring Ava Michelle, was also a success with 41m households watching in the first 28 days. We expect that our Q4 film releases will continue to build and strengthen our film effort. Q4 film releases include Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman (with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci), Marriage Story (starring \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and The Two Popes (featuring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan \\u200b \\u200b Pryce), all of which have emerged as early Oscar frontrunners. We also have several big releases such as Dolemite is My Name (starring Eddie Murphy and featuring a breakout performance from Da'Vine Joy \\u200b \\u200b Randolph), 6 Underground (directed by Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds), The Laundromat, from \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b director Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman and The King (starring Timothée \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton) as well as animated features Klaus and I Lost My Body. \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Our goal is to have the quality of our slate rival the ambition of its scope. An example is Orange is the \\u200b New Black, which wrapped its final new season in Q3. The show was celebrated by fans and the media \\u200b for the groundbreaking role it played for Netflix and the culture at large; Time Magazine said “...’Orange is the New Black’ is the most important TV show of the decade.” Our very popular Ozark, \\u200b \\u200b Our Planet, Queer Eye, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and When They See Us led 40 Netflix original series \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and films to a record 117 Emmy Nominations and 27 wins in 2019. With so many firms now looking to provide premium video content to consumers, it’s a great time to be a creator of content. Amazing content can be expensive. We don’t shy away from taking bold swings if we think the business impact will also be amazing. We don’t close every deal we chase and we don’t chase every deal on the table. And while not all projects that we do pursue will work out, our large and growing subscription base helps enable us to try many approaches, while the size of our content budget (~$10 billion on P&L spend and ~$15 billion in cash content spend in 2019) insulates us from dependency on any single title. We’ll continue to learn as we go, while staying disciplined by assessing each opportunity individually, steadily marching up our operating margin and improving free cash flow. 4Product and Partnerships We seek to make it easier for future members to sign up and enjoy Netflix. To that end, we rolled out a lower priced mobile plan in India in July and we’re pleased with the results. Our approach with pricing is to grow revenue and so far, uptake and retention on our mobile plan in India has been better than our initial testing suggested. This will allow us to invest more in Indian content to further satisfy our members. While still only a very small percentage of our total subscriber base, we’re continuing to test mobile-only plans in other markets. We continued to expand our partner-based bundle offerings, adding bundles with Sky Italia, Canal+ in France, KDDI in Japan and Izzi in Mexico this quarter. We just localized our service in Vietnamese, Hungarian and Czech so that more entertainment fans can enjoy thousands of hours of TV shows and films in their preferred language. We’ll continue to expand language coverage and accessibility. Competition We compete broadly for entertainment time. This means there are many competitive activities to Netflix (from watching linear TV to playing video games, for example). But there is also a very large market opportunity; today we believe we’re less than 10% of TV screen time in the US (our most mature market) and much less than that in mobile screen time. Many are focused on the “streaming wars,” but we’ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade. The upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV. While the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world. The launch of these new services will be noisy. There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we’ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. By way of example, our growth in Canada, where Hulu does not exist, is nearly identical to our growth in the US (where Hulu is very successful at about 30 million paid memberships). Our penetration in both markets below: 5We believe this is due to the big factor of streaming growing into linear TV plus the fact that streaming video services have mostly exclusive content libraries that make them highly differentiated from one another. In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and Discovery didn’t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience share from broadcast viewing. Content creation is booming around the world and everyone is vying for consumer attention. Over the next 10 years, many streaming services will grow viewing as streaming replaces linear TV. Our focus will continue to be on pleasing our members and growing engagement because that approach has served us well since 1997. Total viewing, as measured by various 3rd parties, is the best indicator of our relative success since it’s a signal of customer satisfaction, and few of the services will disclose streaming video revenue, and subscriber figures are hard to interpret (given bundles, discounts and other promotions). Our focused approach to date has driven meaningful growth in our membership base and engagement. We did well during the first decade of streaming. We’ve been preparing for this new wave of competition for a long time. It’s why we started investing in originals in 2012 and expanded aggressively ever since - across programming categories and countries with an ambition to share stories from the world to the world. In Q4, with The Crown, The Witcher, Klaus, The Irishman, The Two Popes, 6 \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Underground, and many other amazing titles launching, we’re ready to compete to earn consumers’ \\u200b attention and viewing. 6Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q3’19 was -$502 million vs. -$690 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 in Q3 totaled -$551 million vs. -$859 million in Q3’18. For the full year 2019, we’re still expecting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we’re expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. As we move slowly toward FCF positive, our plan is to continue to use the high yield market in the interim to finance our investment needs. Next Year Reporting Starting with our Q4’19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region, which is how we think about our business. Our four regions are Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM), and the US and Canada (UCAN). UCAN is roughly 90% US and 10% Canada. Under this new reporting format, we’ll only provide membership guidance for global paid memberships for the next quarter with each earnings report. \\u200b As we self-produce and license more original content that has global rights, we are finding US vs. international segment contribution margin reporting is becoming less useful internally. We’ll stop reporting on it in January 2020 and continue to focus on global operating margin as our primary profitability metric. As a reminder, we’ll no longer report free trial members beginning in 2020 as we informed you in our Q3’18 investor letter. \\u200b \\u200b 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 7Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: July 2019, April 2019, January 2019, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b October 2018, July 2018, April 2018, January 2018, October 2017. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b October 16, 2019 Earnings Interview, 3pm PDT Our video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm \\u200b \\u200b PDT today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated 8that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       "  'We had a strong finish to 2019, with Q4 revenue growing 31% year over year, bringing full year 2019 revenue to over $20 billion, while FY19 operating income rose 62% to $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we surpassed 100 million paid memberships outside of the US. Streaming entertainment is a global phenomenon and we’re working hard to build on our early progress. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast In Q4, average streaming paid memberships grew 21% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 9% year over year. Excluding a -$133 million impact from foreign currency, streaming ARPU rose 12% year over year. Operating income in Q4 amounted to $459m (vs. $216m last year). While this was slightly lower than our beginning-of-quarter forecast of $475m, we’re primarily managing by our full year operating margin target, which we met (13% in FY19 vs. 10% in FY18). EPS for Q4 amounted to $1.30 vs. $0.30 a year ago. During Q4, the US Treasury issued final regulations on certain aspects of the 2017 US tax reform. As a result, we had over-accrued in the first three quarters of 2019 for tax, which was adjusted in Q4, resulting in our net income being higher than operating \\u200b income this quarter. We paid US corporate taxes for the full year inclusive of this Q4 adjustment. 1Global paid net additions totaled 8.8m in Q4, on par with the 8.8m in the prior year period and ahead of our forecast of 7.6m, fueled by our broad slate of original programming and the worldwide adoption of streaming video. We generated Q4-record paid net adds in each of the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions, while UCAN paid net adds totaled 0.55m (with 0.42m in the US) vs. 1.75m in the year ago quarter. Our low membership growth in UCAN is probably due to our recent price changes and to US competitive launches. We have seen more muted impact from competitive launches outside the US (NL, CA, AU). As always, we are working hard to improve our service to combat these factors and push net adds higher over time. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1’20, we forecast global paid net adds of 7.0m vs. 9.6m in Q1’19, which was an all-time high in quarterly paid net adds. Our Q1’20 forecast reflects the continued, slightly elevated churn levels we are seeing in the US plus an expectation for more balanced paid net adds across Q1 and Q2 this year, with seasonality more similar to 2018 than 2019. This is due in part to the timing of last year’s price changes and a strong upcoming Q2 content slate, where we’ll have some of our bigger titles like La Casa De Papel \\u200b (aka Money Heist) season 4. \\u200b \\u200b We’re targeting a 16% operating margin in 2020 (up 300 basis points year over year). As a reminder, large swings in foreign exchange (F/X) could lead to some temporary variations from our annual margin progression, partially because we don’t spend on derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars. Content Great content grows engagement among our members, which we believe drives word-of-mouth, improves retention and grows paid memberships. We have many exciting releases for Q1’20 including 2returning seasons of Sex Education, Altered Carbon, Narcos: Mexico, the Spanish series Elite and Korean \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b historical zombie thriller Kingdom, as well as action film Spenser Confidential (starring Mark Wahlberg) \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and the movie sequel To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You. New original series include the recently \\u200b \\u200b released Messiah and the buzzy docu-series Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez and the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b upcoming I Am Not Okay with This. \\u200b These titles build off of a highly successful Q4 content slate, which included new seasons of The Crown, \\u200b Big Mouth and You and new series and films like Rhythm & Flow, American Son, Turkish series The Gift \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and French film Banlieusards (aka Street Flow). The psychological thriller You, which originated on US \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b linear TV with a modest audience, has evolved into a global phenomenon on Netflix; we estimate, based on the first few weeks, 54m member households will choose to watch season 2 in its first 4 weeks. In its first four weeks, over 21m member households have chosen to watch season 3 of The Crown (up over \\u200b \\u200b 40% from Season 2 over the same time period) and in total, over 73m households worldwide have chosen The Crown since the series launched. The Crown and the all new Season 3 cast just won the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama series and star Olivia Colman won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series. During December, we also launched The Witcher, which is tracking to be our biggest season one TV \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b series ever. Through its first four weeks of release, 76m member households chose to watch this \\u200b action-packed fantasy, starring Henry Cavill. As a testament to how our hit content can penetrate the global zeitgeist and influence popular culture, the show’s launch drove up sales of The Witcher books \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b and games around the world, and spawned a viral musical hit. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Our Q4 movie slate set a new bar for the variety and high quality of films we produce to appeal to our members’ many different tastes. We released 6 Underground, from director Michael Bay and starring \\u200b \\u200b Ryan Reynolds, and 83m member households chose this crowd-pleasing action film through its first four weeks. The exceptional breadth and quality of our film slate was recognized as we led all studios with 24 Academy Award nominations across eight different films. The nominated feature films produced by the Netflix studio like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes were also very popular with our \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b members. Having launched our original film initiative just under five years ago, this is a proud achievement and a testament to the creative talent with whom we partner. \\u200b Across both film and TV, we were also recognized for being the home for storytellers and creators from many diverse backgrounds. We’re honored to lead the industry in nominations at both the NAACP Image \\u200b Awards (42 nominations) and the GLAAD Media Awards (15 nominations). \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b We know that local audiences love local stories. In fact, local originals were the most popular 2019 titles in many countries, including India, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Thailand, Sweden and the UK. In addition, we\\'ve seen how members all around the world also love these stories with La Casa de Papel/Money \\u200b Heist appearing on our top ten lists in more than 70 countries. K-content is also popular globally, and \\u200b we\\'re investing heavily in Korean stories. In this past quarter, we inked a TV output deal with JTBC, a leading Korean media company, and a strategic partnership with CJ ENM’s Studio Dragon, Korea’s largest TV studio. These deals will enable us to bring more K-dramas to fans all over the world. 3Over the past several years, we’ve been developing an animation studio within Netflix to produce a wide array of animated content for kids, adults and families. We have amazing creators with pedigree from Disney Animation, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination now working at Netflix on their next big projects. In Q4, we debuted filmmaker Sergio Pablos’ Klaus, our first original feature-length \\u200b \\u200b animated film that was also nominated for an Academy Award. In its first 28 days, 40m members chose to watch this heartwarming Santa Claus origin story. Later in 2020, we’ll premiere the ambitious Over \\u200b The Moon, from legendary animator Glen Keane, followed by a schedule that builds to several big \\u200b animated feature films per year. As we’ve expanded our original content, we’ve been working on how to best share content highlights that demonstrate popularity. Given that we now have titles with widely varying lengths - from short episodes (e.g. Special at around 15 minutes) to long films (e.g. The Highwaymen at 132 minutes), we \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b believe that reporting households viewing a title based on 70% of a single episode of a series or of an entire film, which we have been doing, makes less sense. We are now reporting on households (accounts) that chose to watch a given title1. Our new methodology is similar to the BBC iPlayer in their rankings based on “requests” for the title, “most popular” articles on the New York Times which include \\u200b those who opened the articles, and YouTube view counts. This way, short and long titles are treated equally, leveling the playing field for all types of our content including interactive content, which has no fixed length. The new metric is about 35% higher on average than the prior metric. For example, 45m member households chose to watch Our Planet under the new metric vs. 33m under the prior metric. \\u200b \\u200b Product and Partnerships In Product, we are investing our resources to grow engagement and our storytelling capabilities (like the branching narratives in Black Mirror: Bandersnatch), deepen our penetration in key markets and help \\u200b \\u200b our members find great content through better suggestions. To do this, we try many approaches; in 2019 alone, we conducted hundreds of product tests to try to improve our member experience from sign up to billing and payments to content discovery. About 30% of these led to a gain in retention, engagement or revenue, up from 20% in the prior year. It’s a humbling exercise as so many of our ideas do not “win” with members, but this helps tune our judgment and innovation priorities for the future. In Q4, we launched a mobile-only plan in Malaysia and Indonesia (which we introduced to India in Q3 last year). We’ve seen similar results with this plan driving incremental subscriber growth and improving retention. We expect the mobile-only plan to be revenue-positive which will allow us to further invest in content to be enjoyed by our members and continue to feed the virtuous cycle. We plan to continue to test adding this plan, as well as additional ideas in other countries around the world. Competition Many media companies and tech giants are launching streaming services, reinforcing the major trend of the transition from linear to streaming entertainment. This is happening all over the world and is still in its early stages, leaving ample room for many services to grow as linear TV wanes. We have a big 1 Chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes -- long enough to indicate the choice was intentional -- is the precise definition 4headstart in streaming and will work to build on that by focusing on the same thing we have focused on for the past 22 years - pleasing members. We believe if we do that well, Netflix will continue to prosper. As an example, in Q4, despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the US on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters. Below is a comparison of Google search trends for The Witcher, Disney’s The Mandalorian, Amazon’s \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Jack Ryan and Apple’s The Morning Show. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Disney+ were global we don’t think the picture would be much different, to judge from the NL results where Disney+ first launched. \\u200b \\u200b Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q4, net cash used in operating activities was -$1.5 billion vs. -$1.2 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2 in Q4 totaled -$1.7 billion vs. -$1.3 billion in Q4’18. For the full year, FCF was -$3.3 billion which we believe is the peak in our annual FCF deficit. Our plan is to continually improve FCF each year and to move slowly toward FCF positive. For 2020, we currently forecast FCF of approximately -$2.5 billion. Along the way, we’ll continue to use the debt market to finance our investment needs as we did in Q4’19, when we raised $1.0 billion 4.875% senior notes and 1.1 billion 3.625% senior notes, both due in 2030. With our FCF profile improving, this means € that over time we’ll be less reliant on public markets and will be able to fund more of our investment needs organically through our growing operating profits. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2019, July 2019, April 2019, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b January 2019, October 2018, July 2018, April 2018, January 2018. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Appendix Table 1 6Table 2 (Final letter for this table) 7January 21, 2020 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST Our video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm \\u200b \\u200b PST today.

IR Contact: PR Contact: Spencer Wang Richard Siklos VP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development VP, Communications 408 809-5360 408 540-2629 Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding global paid net additions; churn; seasonality;; distribution of net adds across quarters; full-year operating margin target; future content offerings; product tests; revenue impact of product changes; future capital raises; reliance on public markets for cash needs; impact of competition; global streaming paid memberships and growth; consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and peak free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange 8Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2019. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A.

       "  'In our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end. What’s clear is the escalating human cost in terms of lost lives and lost jobs, with tens of millions of people now out of work. At Netflix, we’re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term. Like other home entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth. In our case, this is offset by a sharply stronger US dollar, depressing our international revenue, resulting in revenue-as-forecast. We expect viewing to decline and membership \\u200b growth to decelerate as home confinement ends, which we hope is soon. By helping people connect with stories they love, we are able to provide comfort and escape as well as a sense of community during this pandemic. So our focus has been on maintaining the quality of our service while our employees around the world adapt to working from home. For the most part, this has gone smoothly. Our product teams, for example, have been relatively unaffected. As a precaution, we have temporarily reduced the number of product innovations we try, while continuing to release features that we know will add meaningful value for our members, such as improved parental controls. However, we have seen significant disruption when it comes to customer support and content production. On the customer support side, we’ve now fixed most of our work-from-home challenges. In addition, we’ve taken on another 2,000 agents (all working remotely), so our customer service levels are almost fully restored despite the increased demand. When it comes to production, almost all filming has now been stopped globally, with the exception of a few countries like Korea and Iceland. This has been devastating for millions of workers in the TV and film industry - electricians, hair and make-up artists, carpenters and drivers who are often paid hourly wages and work project-to-project. In March, we created a $100 million fund to help with hardship in the industry, starting with the hardest \\u200b \\u200b hit workers on our productions, where Netflix has the greatest responsibility. We will have paid these crews for about seven weeks, with the goal of providing a bridge until government safety nets kick in. In addition, we’re donating $30 million to third parties and non-profits, providing emergency relief to out-of-work crew and cast across the broader TV and film industry in countries where we have a large production base. This includes donations of $1 million each to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation COVID-19 Disaster Fund, the \\u200b \\u200b Motion Picture and Television Fund and the Actors Fund Emergency Assistance in the US, and $1 million \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b between the AFC and Fondation des Artistes in Canada. These are all well established hardship funds. In \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 1other countries where no such funds exist, we’ve been working to set them up, including in the UK (£1 million) with the British Film Institute, in Italy ( 1 million) with the Italian Film Commission, in France ( 1 \\u200b \\u200b € \\u200b \\u200b € million) with Audiens, in Brazil (R$5 million) with the Brazilian Institute of Audiovisual Content, in Mexico \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b ($1 million) with the Mexican Academy of Film Arts and Sciences, in Spain (€1 million) with the Ministry \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b of Culture and Sport, Accion Cultural and the Film Academy and in the Netherlands (€1 million) with the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Netherlands Film Fund. \\u200b In total, we have committed to spend $150 million supporting the industry through this crisis. Netflix’s culture is designed to empower decision making at all levels of the company. Throughout this crisis, our employees have been working tirelessly to maintain the quality of our service and to find quick, practical solutions to the problems Netflix and our partners face. For example, within two weeks of the shelter-in-place orders coming into effect in Los Angeles, most of our animation production team was back up and running, working from home. On the post production side, we’ve been able to get 200+ projects going remotely. Most of our series writers’ rooms are operating virtually. However, we’ve been unable to create dubs in Italian and some other languages due to home confinement of our voice talent for a handful of titles launching in April and May. But we hope that with the help of guilds around the world, voice actors can be set up from home, ensuring that they can stay safe and continue to earn a living. Similar efforts are underway for both music and visual effects. This pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a strong Internet like never before. Over the years, we’ve invested heavily in Open Connect, a pioneering caching system that puts our library of content as close to members’ homes as possible. This enables ISPs to run their networks more efficiently and at a lower cost. However, given the surge in internet use, networks in some countries have struggled to cope. In March, we were asked by a number of governments and ISPs to temporarily reduce the network traffic of our members. Using our Open Connect technology, our engineering team was able to respond immediately, reducing network use by 25 percent virtually overnight in those countries, while also \\u200b \\u200b substantially maintaining the quality of our service, including in higher definition. We’re now working with ISPs to help increase capacity so that we can lift these limitations as conditions improve. Netflix employees have been outstanding and to help them support their local communities, we’ve doubled our charitable match giving program for 2020. So for every $1 donated by our employees to an organization, we now donate an additional $2 to that organization. Last, and most important of all, we want to say thank you on behalf of all our employees to the heroic doctors, nurses and first responders fighting this pandemic on the frontlines and the grocery, restaurant and other essential workers who take risks to make sure our families are fed and taken care of. We are truly inspired and humbled by you. Our summary results for Q1 and our Q2 forecast can be found in the table below. 2Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Despite paid net additions that were higher than forecast, revenue was in-line with our guidance due to the appreciation in the US dollar vs. other currencies. Excluding a -$115m impact from F/X, streaming ARPU grew 8% year over year. Operating margin of 16.6% (vs. 10.2% in the prior year quarter) was lower than our 18.0% forecast as we incurred $218m in incremental content costs due to paused productions and hardship fund commitments (a 3.8 percentage point impact to operating margin). There are three primary effects on our financial performance from the crisis. First, our membership growth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement. Second, our international revenue will be less than previously forecast due to the dollar rising sharply. Third, due to the production shutdown, some cash spending on content will be delayed, improving our free cash flow, and some title releases will be delayed, typically by a quarter. More on each of these three effects below. During the first two months of Q1, our membership growth was similar to the prior two years, including in UCAN. Then, with lockdown orders in many countries starting in March, many more households joined Netflix to enjoy entertainment. This timing of paid membership additions also affected our Q1’20 global streaming ARPU; this was the primary driver of the sequential decline in streaming ARPU as the revenue impact from these additions late in the quarter will be mostly felt in Q2’20 and beyond. Hopefully, progress against the virus will allow governments to lift the home confinement soon. As that happens, we expect viewing and growth to decline. Our internal forecast and guidance is for 7.5 million global paid net additions in Q2. Given the uncertainty on home confinement timing, this is mostly guesswork. The actual Q2 numbers could end up well below or well above that, depending on many 3factors including when people can go back to their social lives in various countries and how much people take a break from television after the lockdown. Some of the lockdown growth will turn out to be pull-forward from the multi-year organic growth trend, resulting in slower growth after the lockdown is lifted country-by-country. Intuitively, the person who didn’t join Netflix during the entire confinement is not likely to join soon after the confinement. Plus, last year we had new seasons of Money Heist and \\u200b \\u200b Stranger Things in Q3, which were not planned for this year’s Q3. Therefore, we currently guess that \\u200b Q3’20 and Q4’20 will have lower net additions than last year due to these effects. Second, partially due to the crisis, the US dollar has appreciated significantly, which creates a drag on international revenue growth. As an example, the price for our standard plan in Brazil is R$33, which used to be $8.5 last year but now is $6.5 based on April 2020 F/X rates, so we have a ~25% decline in US dollar average subscription price from Brazil, which offsets strong membership growth. Third, we’ve paused most of our productions across the world in response to government lockdowns and guidance from local public health officials. In Q2, there is only a modest impact on our new releases, which is primarily language dubbing. No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages, and post-production) will play out. The impact on us is less cash spending this year as some content projects are pushed out. We are working hard to complete the content we know our members want and we’re complementing this effort with additional licensed films and series. Our content competitors and suppliers will be impacted about as much as we are, in terms of new titles. Since we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our member satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers’ by a shortage of new content, but it will take time to tell. We continue to target a 16% operating margin for the full year 2020, despite the extra costs in Q1. As a reminder, more than half of our revenue is not denominated in US dollars and we don’t hedge our foreign exchange exposure. If the US dollar remains at these elevated levels (or strengthens further), we may target modestly slower growth in our annual operating margin progression next year. Given that lead time, we believe we can readjust our model to be appropriate in that new stronger US dollar world. Content As people shelter at home, our hope is that we can help make that experience more bearable by providing a diverse range of high quality content for our members. While our productions are largely paused around the world, we benefit from a large pipeline of content that was either complete and ready for launch or in post-production when filming stopped. For Q2, we’re looking forward to releasing all of our originally planned shows and films (with some language dubbing impacts on a few titles). We’re also finding ways to bolster our programming this year - including the recent acquisition of Paramount’s and Media Rights Capital’s The Lovebirds, a comedy \\u200b \\u200b starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, for Q2’20 and Legendary Pictures’ Enola Holmes starring Millie \\u200b \\u200b Bobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin, for Q3 ‘20. So, while we’re certainly 4impacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety of new titles throughout 2020 and 2021. Our Q1 slate highlighted the variety of content that people enjoy en masse all over the world on Netflix: scripted English language series like Ozark season 3 (a projected 29m member households will have \\u200b \\u200b chosen to watch this season in its first four weeks), the riveting docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem \\u200b and Madness (64m), our breakthrough unscripted dating show Love is Blind (30m), original film Spenser \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Confidential (85m), and season four of the Spanish language hit La Casa de Papel, aka Money Heist (a \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b projected 65m), which debuted in early April. In Q2, we are looking forward to the launch of Space Force, our new original comedy series created by \\u200b \\u200b Greg Daniels (The Office) and Steve Carell, starring Carell, John Malkovich and Lisa Kudrow. We just \\u200b \\u200b launched our latest buzzy unscripted series Too Hot to Handle, #BlackAF from Kenya Barris and, outside \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b the US, the Michael Jordan documentary The Last Dance, which we co-produced with ESPN (launching \\u200b \\u200b on Netflix in the US on July 19). We will also premiere Hollywood from Ryan Murphy, and, later this \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b\\u200b week, Extraction, a large scale action film starring Chris Hemsworth and directed by Sam Hargrave, who \\u200b \\u200b was the stunt coordinator and choreographer on films like Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War, \\u200b Deadpool 2, and Captain America: Civil War. \\u200b \\u200b Product In February, we rolled out our Top 10 most popular lists to nearly 100 countries, after testing this \\u200b \\u200b feature last year in the UK and Mexico. In each of these countries, there are now three daily lists: Top 10 overall, Top 10 series and Top 10 films. Our goal with this feature is to help members find great TV shows and films and enable them to be part of the cultural zeitgeist in their country. Recently, we’ve also enhanced our parental controls for our service to improve the experience for family members of all ages. Updates include (i) PIN-controlled access to content by maturity level; (ii) the \\u200b \\u200b ability to PIN protect specific titles as well as profiles; (iii) Profile-level content filtering; (iv) the ability to create kids’ experiences that can be customized for different age groups (‘teens and below,’ ‘older kids and below’ and ‘little kids’); and (v) the ability to disable post-play for kids from account settings. Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q1, net cash used in operating activities was +$260 million vs. -$380 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 totaled +$162 million compared with -$460 million in the year ago quarter. As we stated last quarter, our FCF profile is beginning to improve due to growing operating margin and profits and as we digest our big move into the production of Netflix originals (which requires more cash upfront vs. later-window content) that started five years ago. With our productions currently paused, this will shift out some cash spending on content to future years. As a result, we’re now expecting 2020 FCF of -$1 billion or better (compared with our prior 2020 expectation of -$2.5 billion and -$3.3 billion actual in 2019). This dynamic may result in more lumpiness 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5in our path to sustained FCF profitability (as, prior to the pandemic, we had been planning for annual improvement in FCF). However, there has been no material change to our overall time table to reach consistent annual positive FCF and we believe that 2019 will still represent the peak in our annual FCF deficit. We finished the quarter with cash of $5.2 billion, while our $750m unsecured credit facility remains undrawn. Combined with our improved FCF outlook for 2020, we have more than 12 months of liquidity and substantial financial flexibility. Our financing strategy remains unchanged - our current plan is to continue to use debt to finance our investment needs.

       "  \"We live in uncertain times with restrictions on what we can do socially and many people are turning to entertainment for relaxation, connection, comfort and stimulation. In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant pull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million paid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million). As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020 compared to the prior year. As we navigate these turbulent circumstances, we’re focused on our members by continuing to improve the quality of our service and bringing new films and shows to people's screens. Our Q2 summary results and forecast for Q3 are in the table below. Ted Sarandos appointed co-CEO and elected to Board of Directors Ted joined Netflix over 20 years ago, and we are thrilled to appoint him to be co-CEO with Reed. “Ted has been my partner for decades. This change makes formal what was already informal -- that Ted and I share the leadership of Netflix,” says Hastings. Lead Independent director Jay Hoag says “Having watched Reed and Ted work together for so long, the board and I are confident this is the right step to evolve Netflix’s management structure so that we can continue to best serve our members and shareholders for years to come.” 1Ted will also continue to serve as Chief Content Officer. In addition, Greg Peters has been appointed COO adding to his Chief Product Officer role. “We want Greg to help us stay aligned and effective as we grow so quickly around the world,” said Hastings. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast In Q2, revenue grew 25% year over year, while quarterly operating income exceeded $1 billion. Average streaming paid memberships in Q2 rose 25% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 0.4% year over year. Excluding a -$289m impact from foreign exchange (F/X), streaming ARPU grew 5% year over year. Operating margin expanded 770 basis points year over year to 22.1%, above our guidance forecast due to higher than expected membership and revenue growth. In addition, content and marketing expenses were lower than we expected, as the pandemic delayed some planned spend. EPS of $1.59 vs. $0.60 a year ago included a $119m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt and a $220m non-cash valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (due to recent legislation limiting the use of California R&D credits). Our Q2 effective tax rate of 30.5% includes about a 21% point negative impact due to the valuation allowance. We added a Q2-record 10.1m paid memberships vs. 2.7m in last year’s Q2. The positive variance relative to our 7.5m forecast was due to better-than-forecast acquisition and retention. In the first half of this year, we’ve added 26m paid memberships, nearly on par with the 28m we achieved in all of 2019. However, as we expected (and can be seen in the graph below), growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions. Our paid net additions for the month of June also included the subscriptions we cancelled for the small percentage of members who had not used the \\u200b \\u200b service recently. 2The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. We forecast 2.5m paid net adds for Q3’20 vs. 6.8m in the prior year quarter. As we indicated in our Q1’20 letter, we’re expecting paid net adds will be down year over year in the second half as our strong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year. In addition, Q3’19 included the positive impact of new seasons of both Stranger Things and La Casa de \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Papel (aka Money Heist). We continue to view the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b that meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment which we believe provides us with many years of strong growth ahead. For the full year 2020, we’re still targeting a 16% operating margin. We’re currently on track to exceed 16% although F/X (and the relative strength of the US dollar) remains a wildcard. As always, our intention is to grow our annual operating margin year over year - we’re currently targeting 19% for 2021. Content As the world slowly re-opens, our main business priority is to restart our productions safely and in a manner consistent with local health and safety standards to ensure that our members can enjoy a diverse range of high quality new content. Given the significant differences between countries (e.g., incidence of new Covid-19 cases, availability of testing, government and industry regulations), there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and we’re adapting to local circumstances. Today, we’re slowly resuming productions in many parts of the world. We are furthest along in Asia Pacific (where we never fully shut down in Korea, for example) and are now shooting live action series like season 2 of our Japanese original The Naked Director. In EMEA, we are now back in production in \\u200b \\u200b many countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Italy, and the UK. While we recently resumed production on two films in California and two stop-motion animation projects in Oregon and expect some more of our US productions to get going this quarter, current infection trends create more uncertainty for our productions in the US. Parts of the world like India and some of Latin America are also more challenging and we are hoping to restart later in the year in these regions. Since our content production lead time is long, our 2020 plans for launching original shows and films continue to be largely intact. For 2021, based on our current plan, we expect the paused productions will lead to a more second half weighted content slate in terms of our big titles, although we anticipate the total number of originals for the full year will still be higher than 2020. We’ll also round out our content offering with film acquisitions like The Trial of the Chicago 7 from Aaron Sorkin and The \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run (global excluding US and China). We also acquired nearly \\u200b completed seasons of unreleased original series like Cobra Kai (seasons 1, 2 and a brand new season 3) \\u200b \\u200b and Emily in Paris starring Lily Collins. \\u200b \\u200b The pandemic and pauses in production are impacting our competitors and suppliers similarly. With our large library of thousands of titles and strong recommendations, we believe our member satisfaction will remain high. 3In Q2, we notched successes in many of our key content verticals. In English scripted TV, Never Have I \\u200b Ever, a fun, young adult dramedy from Mindy Kaling, broke through with 40m households choosing to \\u200b watch this show in its first four weeks, and 40m households for our new comedy Space Force (starring \\u200b \\u200b Steve Carell). On the heels of Love is Blind, Too Hot to Handle and Floor is Lava are the latest in our line \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b of buzzy unscripted shows (51m and a projected 37m households, respectively, in the first four weeks). In original films, 27 million households chose to watch Spike Lee’s Da 5 Bloods, which was celebrated as \\u200b \\u200b a “soul stirring film for the ages.” Extraction (starring Chris Hemsworth) and The Wrong Missy, a comedy \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b starring David Spade and Lauren Lapkus, were also big hits with audiences (99m and 59m households, respectively, chose to watch in their first 28 days). In addition, The Willoughbys (38m households in the \\u200b \\u200b first four weeks) is an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster our offering for kids and families. We also saw increased viewing for some older titles like 13th, American Son and Dear White People - all \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b part of our Black Lives Matter Collection - as our members sought out stories that speak to racial \\u200b \\u200b injustice and the Black experience in America. Our local language originals - like Dark in Germany, Control Z in Mexico, Extracurricular in Korea, The \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Woods in Poland, or Blood & Water in South Africa - continue to be highly impactful, driving large \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b viewing, buzz and sign-ups in their home countries. We continue to see these stories find audiences all over the world. The best example of this was La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist): Part 4, which we \\u200b \\u200b launched on April 3; through its first 28 days, 65m households chose to watch this hit show. For Q3, we recently released The Old Guard (starring Charlize Theron), which continues our recent string \\u200b \\u200b of adrenaline-filled action movies. Later in July, we’re looking forward to launching season 2 of The \\u200b Umbrella Academy, followed by The Kissing Booth 2 (the sequel to our hit romantic comedy), Project \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Power (an action movie starring Jamie Foxx) and Enola Holmes (featuring Millie Bobbie Brown as the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b sister of Sherlock Holmes, played by Henry Cavill) later in the quarter. Product and Partnerships We continue to test different pricing approaches in some countries including lower priced, mobile-only plans and our bundled offerings with MVPDs and ISPs. While some of these carry lower ARPU, the goal is to accelerate membership growth on neutral-to-better short term revenue (with incremental acquisition and improved retention offsetting the lower price). We think this strategy will increase long term revenue as a larger membership base can generate more word-of-mouth around our content and help us better understand peoples’ needs in that country - so that we can more quickly improve our catalog and product experience, which would then lead to higher member satisfaction and growth as well as improved long term retention. A very small percentage of our members have not watched anything for the last two years and although we make it easy for people to cancel their subscriptions with just a few clicks, they have not taken advantage of that ability. So we decided to stop billing them and will do so for members meeting the same criteria going forward. Like all of our former members, they can easily restart their membership in the future. While this change resulted in a slight hit to revenue, we believe that pro-consumer policies 4like this are the right thing to do and that the long term benefits will outweigh the short term costs. In a world where consumers have many subscriptions, auto-pause on billing after an extended period of non-use should be how leading services operate. Competition All of the major entertainment companies like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal are pushing their own streaming services and two of the most valuable companies in the world, Apple and Amazon, are growing their investment in premium content. In addition, TikTok’s growth is astounding, showing the fluidity of internet entertainment. Instead of worrying about all these competitors, we continue to stick to our strategy of trying to improve our service and content every quarter faster than our peers. Our continued strong growth is a testament to this approach and the size of the entertainment market. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated in operating activities in Q2 was +$1 billion vs. -$544 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 was positive for a second consecutive quarter at +$899m vs. -$594 million. Free cash flow was higher than net income due primarily to the loss on FX remeasurement and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, both of which were non-cash items that reduced net income. Our FCF profile is continuing to improve, which is being driven in part by our growing operating margin and the digestion of our big move into the production of Netflix originals that requires more cash upfront vs. licensed content. In addition, the pause in production has also pushed out cash spending on content into the second half of 2020 and into 2021. Due to the pause in production from the pandemic combined with higher-than-forecast paid net adds year to date, we now expect free cash flow for the full year 2020 to be breakeven to positive, compared with our prior expectation for -$1 billion or better. As we indicated last quarter, in 2021 we project that full year free cash flow will dip back to being negative again, although we believe the FCF deficit will be materially better than our peak deficit level of -$3.3 billion in 2019. There has been no material change in our overall estimated timetable to reach consistent annual positive FCF within the next few years. We’re often asked by investors what our FCF profile would be at “steady state” or when our cash content spending matches our content amortization. The pandemic and the resulting pause in productions provides one early snapshot of what that may look like. In Q2’20, our cash spending on content was $2.6 billion, equivalent to our content amortization of $2.6 billion, or a 1x cash content-to-content amortization ratio2. This resulted in a FCF margin of +15% in Q2. Of course, our plan is to continue to grow our content spend (as we don’t believe we are anywhere near maturity), but the above analysis may prove illustrative. And by the time our cash content-to-content amortization ratio 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 2 For additional details on these concepts, please refer to our Content Accounting Overview slide deck on our investor relations site. \\u200b \\u200b 5reaches 1x on a sustained basis (which is still many years away), we hope to have many more members and much greater revenue, operating margin and FCF. In April, we raised $1 billion of debt at a blended rate of ~3.3% across both US dollar and Euro tranches. We ended Q2 with more than $7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. As part of our commitment to racial equity, we allocated about two percent of our cash holdings - initially up to $100 million - into financial institutions and organizations that directly support Black \\u200b communities in the US. We hope other US large-caps will also consider taking this small and relatively \\u200b easy step to bolster US racial economic equity. With our cash balance, $750 million credit facility (which remains undrawn) and improving FCF profile, we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for over 12 months. As a result, we don’t expect to access the debt markets for the remainder of 2020 and we believe our need for external financing is diminishing.

       "  \"As we expected, growth has slowed with 2.2m paid net adds in Q3 vs. 6.8m in Q3’19. We think this is primarily due to our record first half results and the pull-forward effect we described in our April and July letters. In the first nine months of 2020, we added 28.1m paid memberships, which exceeds the 27.8m that we added for all of 2019. In these challenging times, we’re dedicated to serving our members. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Q3 average streaming paid memberships rose 25%, while streaming ARPU decreased 1.6% year over year. Excluding a foreign exchange (F/X) impact of -$158m, streaming ARPU increased 1% vs. prior year. Revenue was 2% above our beginning-of-quarter guidance primarily due to slightly higher than expected ARPU (favorable plan mix in our UCAN, LATAM and APAC regions plus intra-quarter appreciation in the Euro and British pound which helped lift EMEA ARPU). As a result, operating margin of 20% (up 170bps year over year) exceeded our guidance forecast as well. EPS of $1.74 vs. $1.47 a year ago included a $249m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which accounted for the variance with our EPS guidance. We added 2.2m net memberships in Q3, compared with our 2.5m guidance. Retention remains healthy and engagement per member household was up solidly year over year in Q3’20. As a reminder, our 1guidance is our internal forecast and we strive for accuracy. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and, in others, it will be low. Our APAC region was the largest contributor to our paid membership growth this quarter (46% of Q3 global paid net adds) and APAC revenue rose 66% year over year. We’re pleased with the progress we’re making in this region and, in particular, that we’ve achieved double digit penetration of broadband homes in both South Korea and Japan. While this is encouraging, we still have much work to do and we're working hard to replicate this success in India and other countries. For Q4‘20, we forecast 6.0m paid net adds vs 8.8m in Q4‘19. As we have highlighted in our recent investor letters, we believe our record first half paid net additions would result in slower growth in the back half of this year. If we achieve our forecast, it will put us at a record 34m paid net adds for 2020, well above our prior annual high of 28.6m in 2018. The state of the pandemic and its impact continues to make projections very uncertain, but as the world hopefully recovers in 2021, we would expect that our growth will revert back to levels similar to pre-COVID. In turn, we expect paid net adds are likely to be down year over year in the first half of 2021 as compared to the big spike in paid net adds we experienced in the first half of 2020. We continue to view quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not that meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment, which we believe is still early and should provide us with many years of strong future growth as we continue to improve our service. 2We forecast Q4 operating margin of 13.5% vs. 8.4% last year, which means we’ll over-deliver this year on our original full year margin target; our FY20 operating margin is now expected to be 18% (vs. 16% originally) or a 500 basis point increase year over year. Since 2016, we will have more than quadrupled our annual GAAP operating margin (which is our primary profitability metric). As in the past, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year and at an average rate of 300 basis points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate more lumpiness. Some years we’ll be a little over (like this year when we expect to grow operating margin 500bps), some years a little under, but we are trying to keep on a 300 bps per year long-term trajectory. The increased lumpiness is due to increased F/X exposure from our international success and COVID’s impact on the timing of spending. By moving to this multi-year model, we’ll be able to manage our short term expenses more smoothly as well as grow slightly more efficiently than in the past. As we wrote last quarter, for 2021, we’re targeting a 19% operating margin. Content We are making good and careful progress returning to production, particularly in EMEA and APAC, but also across much of LATAM and UCAN. We’ve restarted production on some of our biggest titles including season four of Stranger Things, action film Red Notice (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and Ryan Reynolds) and The Witcher season two. Since the almost-global shutdown of production back \\u200b \\u200b in mid-March, we have already completed principal photography on 50+ productions and, while the course and impact of C-19 remains unpredictable, we’re optimistic we will complete shooting on over 150 other productions by year-end. For our 2021 slate, we continue to expect the number of Netflix originals launched on our service to be up year over year in each quarter of 2021 and we’re confident that we’ll have an exciting range of programming for our members, particularly relative to other entertainment service options. As 3discussed last quarter, some of our most popular returning titles are expected to launch in the second half of next year. This past quarter, the breadth of our programming was demonstrated with standout titles across many genres. In English language series, we debuted new seasons of The Umbrella Academy and Lucifer; 43m \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and 38m member households chose to watch these titles in the first 28 days, respectively. In mid-September, we also premiered Ryan Murphy’s Ratched, a thriller based on the character from One \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. In its first four weeks, 48m member households chose to watch Ratched. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Our #1 and #2 most watched documentary feature films ever were released in Q3. American Murder: \\u200b The Family Next Door is projected to have 52m members households choose the title in its first 28 days \\u200b and The Social Dilemma had 38m in its first 28 days. \\u200b \\u200b We continue to invest heavily in local language content because we believe that great stories are universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Season one of the Mexican telenovela Oscuro Deseo (Dark Desire) was our biggest local language original globally this quarter. Our \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b slate of Korean dramas continue to travel well throughout APAC and beyond, while anime is another category of content with fans all over the world. Another example of our content traveling around the globe is our non-fiction series Indian \\u200b Matchmaking, which was watched by a quarter of our members in India and millions of members \\u200b outside of India in its first four weeks. Original film continues to be an area of opportunity for us and we had several big hits in Q3. Action thriller The Old Guard (starring Charlize Theron and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood) was our most \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b popular title of the quarter with 78m member households choosing to watch in its first four weeks. Our romantic comedy The Kissing Booth 2 received strong reception (66m member households chose to \\u200b \\u200b watch in the first 28 days), while action film Project Power (starring Jamie Foxx) was also very popular \\u200b \\u200b (75m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks). Late in September, we debuted Enola \\u200b Holmes, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill as her famed detective brother. We estimate 76m \\u200b member households will have chosen this film in the first 28 days. Our content successes highlight our ability to tap into our global audience of nearly 200m members and underscore the notion that content is discovered on Netflix. This applies not only to Netflix originals, but \\u200b \\u200b also to second run programming, like Schitt’s Creek and earlier seasons of Lucifer, both of which are very \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b popular with our members. The latest example is Cobra Kai (based on The Karate Kid films), which \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b originally debuted on YouTube’s subscription service in May 2018 and recently launched on Netflix on August 28. In its first four weeks of release on Netflix, 50m member households chose to watch season one, dramatically expanding its audience. We’re looking forward to season 3 of Cobra Kai premiering exclusively on Netflix on January 8, 2021. In \\u200b \\u200b addition to the recently released The Haunting of Bly Manor (a follow up to the acclaimed The Haunting \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b of Hill House), season one of Emily in Paris and Adam Sandler’s latest film Hubie Halloween, other \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b notable Q4 titles include our animated family film Over the Moon from legendary creator Glen Keane \\u200b \\u200b (premiering this weekend), season four of our award-winning series The Crown and the first season of \\u200b \\u200b Selena. We’ll also have a great slate of films, including The Midnight Sky (directed by and starring George \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 4Clooney), Hillbilly Elegy (from Ron Howard), Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom (with Viola Davis and Chadwick \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Boseman), The Christmas Chronicles 2 (from Chris Columbus), Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey (with \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Forest Whitaker), MANK (David Fincher’s first feature at Netflix) and Ryan Murphy’s The Prom (starring \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden and Kerry Washington). Product and Partnerships We strive to be a global entertainment service that can satisfy the needs of members all over the world. Commissioning and producing local language content is an important part of that. But we also invest heavily into improving our product, partnerships and overall consumer experience. For example, in India in Q3, we localized our service to support Hindi in our user interface. We’re also working with local partners like Reliance Jio, India’s largest mobile operator, where in Q3 we launched a bundle with their mobile and fiber broadband plans. As part of this broad partnership, we’ll integrate Netflix with two of Jio’s set top boxes. We’ve also partnered with financial institutions in India to make payment processing easier and more seamless for our members, which we expect will have retention benefits. All of these initiatives are important and work in concert with our big investment in local originals to improve the Netflix experience for our members. Competition Competition for consumers’ time and engagement remains vibrant. Linear television and other big categories of entertainment, like video games and user generated content from YouTube and TikTok are all vying for consumers’ attention and are strong drivers of screen time usage. We remain quite small relative to overall screen time. This past quarter, we saw the debut of Comcast’s Peacock, which comes on the heels of the launch of HBO Max and Disney+. Disney’s recent management reorganization signals that it is embracing the shift to streaming entertainment. We’re thrilled to be competing with Disney and a growing number of other 5players to entertain people; both consumers and content creators will benefit from our mutual desire to bring the best stories to audiences all over the world. We’ll continue to focus on pleasing our members and improving our service as quickly as possible so that we can be everyone's first choice for online entertainment. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was +$1.3 billion vs. -$502 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)1 was positive for a third consecutive quarter at +$1.1b vs. -$551 million in Q3‘19. Year to date free cash flow is +$2.2 billion vs. -$1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2019. As productions increasingly restart, we expect Q4’20 FCF to be slightly negative and therefore, for the full year 2020, we forecast FCF to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of break-even to positive. This change is due primarily to our higher operating margin expectation for 2020 and the timing of cash spending on content. We expect our FCF profile over the coming years to continue to improve as we increase our profitability and our transition to the production of Netflix originals (which requires more cash upfront vs. second run content) matures. For 2021, we currently expect free cash flow to be -$1 billion to break-even. With $8.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter plus our $750m credit facility (which is undrawn), our need for external financing is diminishing. As indicated last quarter, we don’t have plans to access the capital markets this year.

       "  '2020 was an incredibly difficult year with extraordinary loss for so many families, new restrictions that none of us have ever had to live with before and great uncertainty. We’re enormously grateful that in these uniquely challenging times we’ve been able to provide our members around the world with a source of escape, connection and joy while continuing to build our business. With 8.5m paid net additions in Q4, we crossed the 200m paid memberships mark. For the full year, we added a record 37m paid memberships, achieved $25 billion in annual revenue (+24% year over year) and grew operating profit 76% to $4.6 billion. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Average paid streaming memberships increased 23% year over year in Q4, while average revenue per membership1 was flat year over year both on a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis. Revenue was 1% higher than our guidance forecast, as paid net adds exceeded our 6.0m projection by 2.5m. Operating margin of 14.4% (a 600bps increase from Q4’19) also came in above our guidance, due to higher-than-expected revenue. EPS of $1.19 vs. $1.30 a year ago included a $258m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. For the full year, our 37m paid net additions represented a 31% increase from 2019’s 28m paid net adds. We’re becoming an increasingly global service with 83% of our paid net adds in 2020 coming from 1 Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of \\u200b streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period; it was previously referred to as streaming ARPU. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1outside the UCAN region. Our EMEA region accounted for 41% of our full year paid net adds, while APAC was the second largest contributor to paid net additions with 9.3m (up 65% year over year). As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q1’21, we expect paid net adds of 6.0m vs. last Q1’s 15.8m, which included the impact from the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. Since the start of 2018, our paid memberships have risen from 111m to 204m and our average revenue per membership has grown from $9.88 to $11.02, despite significant F/X headwinds. This approach has allowed us to organically increase revenue by $4-$5 billion annually over the past several years. We’ve made good progress growing our profitability with FY20 operating margin of 18% rising five percentage points over prior year. For FY21, we’re now targeting a 20% operating margin, up two percentage points from 2020 and higher than our previous 19% forecast, due to a more favorable revenue outlook. As we said last quarter, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year at an average rate of three percentage points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate some lumpiness. Some years we’ll be a little over (like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021), but we are trying to keep on an average three percentage points per year long-term trajectory. Content The big growth in streaming entertainment has led legacy competitors like Disney, WarnerMedia and Discovery to compete with us in new ways, which we’ve been expecting for many years. This is, in part, why we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a wide range of genres and nations. Our fourth quarter slate highlights the breadth and diversity of our entertainment offering. 2In scripted English language television, season four of the critically acclaimed The Crown was the biggest \\u200b \\u200b season so far and drove new watchers of prior seasons. In its first 28 days, more member households chose to watch season four of The Crown than each of the prior seasons, helping to grow the number of \\u200b \\u200b member households that have chosen to watch this series to over 100m since its initial launch. In late December, we released our first original series from Shonda Rhimes, Bridgerton. This title has proven \\u200b \\u200b immensely popular and we’ll have some exciting news about Bridgerton later this week. \\u200b \\u200b Our largest original film of the quarter was The Midnight Sky, starring and directed by George Clooney; \\u200b \\u200b we estimate 72m member households will choose to watch this title in its first four weeks. In its first 28 days, 43m member households chose to watch our animated feature film Over the Moon (directed by \\u200b \\u200b legendary creator Glen Keane) with high levels of rewatching. We Can Be Heroes (directed by Robert \\u200b \\u200b Rodriguez) was another successful family film with a projected 53m member households choosing this title in its first four weeks. Our holiday movie slate also resonated with our members; in the first four weeks, 68m and 61m member households chose to watch Holidate (starring Emma Roberts) and The Christmas Chronicles: \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Part Two (starring Kurt Russell), respectively. Our first Portuguese language holiday film from Brazil, Just \\u200b \\u200b Another Christmas (starring Leandro Hassum), was also a big hit with 26m member households globally \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b choosing to watch in the first 28 days of release. We continue to ramp up our local original content slate. Our top local titles this quarter include Barbarians (a historical action series from Germany that 37m member households globally chose to \\u200b watch in the first four weeks), Sweet Home, our Korean language horror show (22m member \\u200b \\u200b households), Selena: The Series, which particularly resonated with members throughout Mexico and the \\u200b \\u200b US (25m member households globally), and Alice in Borderland, a sci-fi thriller from Japan (18m member \\u200b \\u200b households). While designed to be very impactful in the home country, we see many cases of our local originals traveling more broadly. For example, Lupin, an adrenalin-filled French language heist series \\u200b \\u200b released in early January, has hit #2 in our US Top 10 list and ranked #1 in dozens of other countries including Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Vietnam, the Philippines and many more. We project 70m member households will choose to watch Lupin in its first 28 days of release. \\u200b \\u200b In addition to titles with big viewership, we also aspire to have hits that become part of the cultural zeitgeist. In 2020 alone, we had Tiger King, Bridgerton and The Queen’s Gambit. Not only did 62m \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b member households choose to watch The Queen’s Gambit in its first 28 days (making this show our \\u200b \\u200b biggest limited series in Netflix history), but it ignited sales of chess sets and inspired the next generation \\u200b \\u200b of chess prodigies. In fact, Netflix series accounted for nine out of the 10 most searched shows globally in 2020, while our films represented two of the top 10. 3Google Year in Search, 2020 (Global) \\u200b \\u200b Our productions are back up and running in most regions - we have learned that flexibility and adaptability are paramount in this fast-changing environment. With over 500 titles currently in post production or preparing to launch on our service and plans to release at least one new original film \\u200b every week in 2021 with extraordinary talent, we’re confident we’ll continue to have a great content \\u200b offering for our members. In Q1, in addition to the recently released season 3 of Cobra Kai and Lupin, we’re excited to be launching \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b later this quarter To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before 3, the finale to this beloved rom com trilogy, our \\u200b \\u200b young adult drama Fate: The Winx Saga, Yes Day (a family movie starring Jennifer Garner), Sky Rojo, a \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b thrilling new series from the creators of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist) and Space Sweepers, an \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b action packed Korean sci-fi film. Product Last year, we continued to improve our parental controls so that families have more control over their experience. These enhancements include allowing members to filter out content at the title level or by maturity rating, creating a profile lock PIN and customizing autoplay settings for any profile. We also extended parental control support to downloads to give parents peace of mind regardless of how Netflix is used. And we provided parents with more transparency into the themes, characters and content that their kids love with the Kids Activity Report, a weekly message designed to keep parents informed about the content their children are watching. As we bring our members more great programming, we’re always listening and working to make it easier for them to find the right show and film to watch. That’s why last year we debuted our Top 10 lists around the world, and in October we introduced the New & Popular tab in our television user interface, which includes a new Worth the Wait section, highlighting titles as far as a year away that you can remind yourself about. As another exciting step in this effort, we’ve been testing a new feature that 4gives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse. The response has been positive and we plan to roll it out globally in the first half of 2021. Competition It’s a great time to be a consumer of entertainment. There are a wealth of options ranging from linear TV to video gaming to user generated content on YouTube and TikTok. We continue to work hard to grow our small share of screen time against these major competitors. Discovery recently launched its streaming service. Disney+ is expanding in new countries and with more \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b content. ViacomCBS will be unveiling its plans for Paramount+ in 2021. Combined with the launch of AppleTV+, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming services, this signifies that these companies all recognize the future is streaming entertainment, a vision we have been working towards since inception. Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment. This past year is a testament to this approach. Disney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid membership growth in our history. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$138 million vs. -$1.5 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow2 (FCF) for the quarter was -$284 million vs. -$1.7 billion in Q4‘19, bringing full year 2020 free cash flow to +$1.9 billion vs. -$3.3 billion in 2019. We believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive. For the full year 2021, we currently anticipate free cash flow will be around break even (vs. our prior expectation for -$1 billion to break even). Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750m undrawn credit facility, we believe \\u200b we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations. Our 5.375% \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b February 1, 2021 bonds mature in Q1. We plan on repaying the bond at maturity out of cash on hand, as we are currently well above our minimum cash needs. As we generate excess cash, we intend to maintain $10B-15B in gross debt and will explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks, as we did in the past (2007-2011). Long-Term Stock Price Performance We thank our equity and debt investors for their trust and for coming along with us on our journey to build one of the world’s leading entertainment companies. Since day one, we’ve managed Netflix for the long term under the belief that pleasing our members would lead to strong value creation for our fellow shareholders. Going forward, in each January investor letter, we’ll provide an update on our long-term stock performance. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the \\u200b reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5Annualized Performance (%)* 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 Year Since IPO NFLX 67% 41% 36% 36% 40% S&P 500 18% 14% 15% 14% 9% NASDAQ 45% 24% 22% 18% 13% Cumulative Return (%)* 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 Year Since IPO NFLX 67% 182% 373% 2,054% 50,388% S&P 500 18% 49% 103% 267% 399% NASDAQ 45% 93% 172% 444% 830%  As of 12/31/20.

       "  \"Revenue grew 24% year over year and was in line withour beginning of quarter forecast, while operating profit and margin reached all-time highs. We finishedQ1’21 with 208m paid memberships, up 14% year over year, but below our guidance forecast of 210mpaid memberships. We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forwardin 2020 and a lighter content slate in the firsthalf of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays. We continueto anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hitsand an exciting film lineup. In the short-term, thereis some uncertainty from Covid-19; in the long-term,the rise of streaming to replace linear TV aroundthe world is the clear trend in entertainment. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Average revenue per membership1rose 6% year overyear, or 5%, excluding a foreign exchange impact of +$80m. Operating income of $2 billion vs. $958 millionmore than doubled vs. Q1’20. This exceeded our guidance forecast primarily due to the timing of contentspend. EPS of $3.75 vs. $1.57 a year ago included a $253m non-cash unrealized gain from F/Xremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The extraordinary events of Covid-19 led to unprecedentedmembership growth in 2020, as it pulled forward growth from 2021, and delayed production acrossevery region. In turn, we ended 2020 with a bigger membership and revenue base than we would otherwisehave had, contributing to record Q1’21 revenues. And since we were still ramping productionlevels late last year, we had lower content spendin 1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesales taxes or VAT. Q1’21 - content amortization only grew 9.5% year over year in Q1’21 vs. 17% in FY20. The result was a 10 percentage point year over year jump in our operatingmargin to 27% in Q1, which is an all-time high. As we discussed in past letters, these dynamics arealso contributing to a lighter content slate in thefirst half of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth. In Q1, paid net additions of 4m were below our 6m guidance (and the 16m net additions inthe year ago quarter) primarily due to acquisition, as retention in Q1 was in line with our expectations.We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor inthe variance as the over-forecast was across allof our regions. We also saw similar percentage year-over-yeardeclines in paid net adds in all regions (see our Regional Breakdown table below), whereas the levelof competitive intensity varies by country. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be highrelative to our guidance forecast and, in others,it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. Asour membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paidnet additions performance vs. forecast. With similar pull forward and delayed slate dynamicsplus our typical seasonality expected to impact Q2’21, we project paid net additions of 1m (vs. 10min the prior year quarter) with our UCAN and LATAM regions expected to be roughly flattish in memberships(+/- a couple hundred thousand paid net adds). We anticipate paid membership growth will re-acceleratein the second half of 2021 as we ramp into a very strong back half slate with the return of bighits likeSex Education,The Witcher,La Casa dePapel (akaMoney Heist), andYou, as well as an excitingarray of original films including the finale toTheKissing Boothtrilogy and large scale, star-driven featureslikeRed Notice(starring Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds) andDon’t Look Up(with an all-starcast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and MerylStreep). We’ll also have our most comprehensive offering to date of local language titlesincludingToo Hot to Handlefor Brazil and Mexico, 2a special based on our Korean hit franchiseKingdom, the action-thrillerDhamaka(India), as well as new seasons ofSintonia(Brazil), andControl Z(Mexico). As always, we’re focusing on the fundamentals of ourbusiness, which remain healthy. In addition to our record financial results, engagement per member householdgrew solidly year over year in Q1’21. We’re also seeing how much members value Netflix with Q1’21churn below Q1‘20 levels, demonstrating that as we improve the service, we can charge a bit more.Our FY21 operating margin target of 20% vs. 18% last year remains unchanged. We are optimistic aboutthe future and believe we are still in the earlydays of the adoption of internet entertainment, which shouldprovide us with many years of growth ahead. Content As seen in the weekly growth chart above, in earlyQ1, with the benefit ofBridgerton,LupinandCobra Kai, we were following a growth trajectory similarto recent years. As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will leadto a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises.And while the roll out of vaccines is very uneven across the world, we are back up and producing safelyin every major market, with the exception of Brazil and India. Assuming this continues, we’ll spendover $17 billion in cash on content this year and we’ll continue to deliver an amazing range of titlesfor our members with more originals this year than last. There are several facets to our content strategy.First and foremost, we want to deliver a wide varietyof best-in-class stories that our members love and watchin big numbers. Examples of this breadth in Q1 include season one ofFirefly Lane(49m chose to watchthis title in its first 28 days), season 3 ofCobra Kai(45m),Fate: The Winx Saga(57m), andGinny &Georgia(52m). Our top movies in Q1 includeI CareA Lot(56m),YES DAY(62m),Outside the Wire(66m) andthe last installment ofTo All the Boys I’ve Loved 3Beforetrilogy (51m). We program across many genres because tastes are very diverse. Even for one person, what they desire will vary widely dependingon their mood or who they are watching with. Another goal is to create great, locally authenticstories in countries all around the world. It’s whyour priority for local language titles is to have a bigimpact in the home territory so we don’t sacrificelocal impact for “travelability.” But we’re increasinglyseeing that these local titles find significant audiences around the world, which supports our thesis that greatstories are universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Notable standoutsthis quarter includeBelow Zerofrom Spain (47m chose to watch in its first four weeks),Space Sweepersfrom Korea (26m),Squared Lovefrom Poland (31m) andWho Killed Sara?from Mexico (an estimated55m), which is also our most popular non-English title ever in the US in its first 28 days(with season 2 launching on May 19). We want our titles to be talked about by audiencesacross the globe. Because of our broad distribution and highly engaged members, our titles not only generatehigh levels of viewing but also can pierce the cultural zeitgeist and transcend the film and TV industry. There were two recent standout examples of this:Lupin, our French language series about a daringgentleman burglar played by Omar Sy, was not only our most popular new title this quarter on Netflix(76m member households chose to watch in the first 28 days), but it alsopropelled book salesofthe novel in France;Lupin: Part 2will debut laterin Q2’21. Similarly, driven by the late December launchof season one ofBridgerton, Julia Quinn’s bookshit The New York Timesbestseller list for the first timein 18 years. Netflix led all studios for recent award nominationsincluding the Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG Awards, BAFTA and the NAACP Image Awards, among others. Headinginto the Academy Awards this weekend, we have 36 nominations across 17 films including twonominees in each of the Best Picture (Mank,The Trial of the Chicago 7), Best Documentary Feature(Crip Camp,My Octopus Teacher), and Best Animated Feature (Over the Moon,A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon)categories.Mankled all films with 10 nominations. Product We are constantly working to make it easier for membersto access and enjoy something they will love, regardless of their location or mood. In Q1, we launchedan opt-inDownloads for Youfeature for Android (with iOS coming soon) that automatically downloadsrecommended shows and movies onto a member's mobile device, ensuring that they alwayshave something to watch irrespective of connectivity. Knowing that bandwidth and storage canbe precious, this feature tries to choose only the most relevant content to download. This quarter we also launchedFast Laughs, a mobilefeed of short comedy clips from Netflix favorites- it's initially available in several countries includingthe US on iOS and will be on Android soon. For television viewers, this month we unveiled an updatedand improved experience for Kids Profile that more vividly and easilyconnects childrenwith theirfavorite titles and characters. 4Competition We compete with many activities for consumers’ entertainmenttime, ranging from watching linear TV, video gaming, and viewing user generated content,just to name a few. Against this backdrop, the entertainment market is huge, giving us plenty ofroom to grow, if we can continue to improve our service. We believe we are less than 10% of TV screentime in the US and even smaller in other regions and when including mobile devices. More and more new streaming services are launching,reinforcing our vision that linear TV will slowly give way to streaming entertainment. Despite our 10+year head start, we are continually seeking operational and creative excellence; we’re workingas hard as ever to continually improve our serviceso that we are the best entertainment option availablewith best in class stories, an ever-improving product experience and authentic local titles that our memberslove. Our ability to evolve from a DVD-by-mail to an internet entertainment business, from a US-onlyto a global service, and from a licensor of second window content to a producer of original content acrossso many different categories fuels our confidence and optimism for our next decade of challenges,growth and innovation. When comparing services, subscriber figures alonetell only part of the story (given bundles, discounts and other promotions) so it’s important to also focuson engagement and revenue as key indicators of success; they drive the flywheel of investment ineven more amazing stories for our members and future growth. It’s our job to please our members so muchon Monday, that on Tuesday, they start with us, and then they stick with us as their first choice forentertainment. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was$777 million vs. $260 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was$692 million vs. $162 million in Q1‘20. We are ontrack for full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximatelybreak even. As we discussed last quarter, we believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positiveand that we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repaid our 5.375% February1, 2021 bond ($500 million principal) out of balance sheet cash, reducing our total gross debt balanceto $15.7 billion as of March 31, 2021. We intend to maintain $10-$15 billion of gross debt. Our boardhas approved a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock beginning in 2021 with no fixedexpiration date. We expect our buyback program will begin this quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We’ve added a new section to our investor relationssite that collates all of ourESG informationforour investors, including our recently published2020 ESGReport(filed March 30, 2021). Our 2020 ESG report includes our commitment to achieve net zero greenhousegas emissions by the end of 2022. We also 2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cashprovided by (used in) operating activities, pleaserefer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attachedunaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5released our firstInclusion Reportaround the makeup of our workforce and a third-party diversity audit of our content by theUSC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative,designed to set industry benchmarks around these important issues.

       "  'In Q2, revenue increased 19% year over year to $7.3billion, while operating income rose 36% year over year to $1.8 billion. We finished the quarter withover 209m paid memberships, slightly ahead of our forecast. COVID has created some lumpiness in ourmembership growth (higher growth in 2020, slower growth this year), which is working its way through.We continue to focus on improving our service for our members and bringing them the best stories fromaround the world. Our summary results and forecast for Q3 are below. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Revenue growth was driven by an 11% increase in averagepaid streaming memberships and 8% growth in average revenue per membership (ARM)1. ARM rose4%, excluding a foreign exchange (FX) impact of +$277m. Operating margin of 25.2% expanded 3 percentagepoints compared with the year ago quarter. EPS of $2.97 vs. $1.59 a year ago included a $63mnon-cash unrealized loss from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The pandemic has created unusual choppiness in ourgrowth and distorts year-over-year comparisons as acquisition and engagement per member household spikedin the early months of COVID. In Q2’21, our engagement per member household was, as expected,down vs. those unprecedented levels but was still up 17% compared with a more comparable Q2’19. Similarly,retention continues to be strong and better than pre-COVID Q2’19 levels, even as average revenueper membership has grown 8% over this two-year 1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesales taxes or VAT. 1period, demonstrating how much our members value Netflix and that as we improve our service we can charge a bit more. We added 1.5m paid memberships in Q2, slightly aheadof our 1.0m guidance forecast. The APAC region represented about two-thirds of our global paid net adds in the quarter. As expected, Q2 paid memberships in the UCAN region were slightly downsequentially (-0.4m paid net adds). We believe our large membership base in UCAN coupled with a seasonallysmaller quarter for acquisition is the main reason for this dynamic. This is similar to what weexperienced in Q2’19 when our UCAN paid net adds were -0.1m; since then we’ve added nearly 7.5m paidnet adds in UCAN. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q3’21, we forecast paid net additions of 3.5mvs. 2.2m in the prior year period. If we achieve our forecast, we will have added more than 54m paid netadds over the past 24 months or 27m on an annualized basis over that time period, which is consistentwith our pre-COVID annual rate of net additions. We forecast that ARM will grow roughly5% year over year on a FX neutral basis in Q3’21. We continue to target a 20% operating margin for thefull year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. After our big global launch in January 2016, we committed to steadily growingour operating margin thereafter at an average rate of three percentage points per year over anyfew-year period. Some years we’ll be a little over(like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021).Assuming we achieve our margin target this year,we will have quintupled our operating margin in the lastfive years and are tracking ahead of this average annual three percentage point pace. 2With revenue and margin both increasing, our operatingprofit dollars have risen dramatically as well (even as we have been investing heavily), from about$100 million per quarter in 2016 to nearly $2 billion per quarter so far in 2021. Our belief isthat as we steadily improve our service to betterplease our members, this will lead to continued growth inour membership base, ARM, revenue, operating margin and profit dollars. Content We launched our first original scripted TV seriesin 2012 and we’ve since expanded our original programming effort to many additional categories,from all over the world. Our goal is to be everyone’s first choice for entertainment because of the varietyand quality of our titles. And despite the COVID-related production delays in 2020, we were ableto deliver an exciting portfolio of titles in Q2’21 that exemplify this ambition. For example,Shadow and Bone, a fantasy series basedon the popularGrishaverse book series, proved to be very popular with our members. Over 55m memberhouseholds chose to watch this show in its first 28 days and we’ve renewed it for a second season.Sweet Tooth, based on the beloved DC comic, was another hit series with 60m member households choosingthis title in its first four weeks. Our expansion into non-fiction series is going well.This past quarter, standout unscripted titles include season two of dating showToo Hot to Handleand socialexperiment reality programThe Circle(an estimated 29m and 14m, respectively, chose to watchin the first 28 days) as well as the true crime docu-seriesThe Sons of Sam(19m). We’re buildingout some of these unscripted titles with local versions of the same formats. As one example,TooHot to Handle: BrazilandToo Hot to Handle: Latino will be launching later in July and September, respectively,to serve our LATAM region. 3We’re also quickly growing both our live action and animated original film offering, with several impactful titles in Q2. Zack Snyder’sArmy of the Deadwas a blockbuster as 75m member households chose to watch this action packed zombie spectaclein its first 28 days of release. As an extensionto Army of the Dead, a prequel,Army of Thieves, willbe released in Q4’21 along with a spinoff anime series later in 2022.Fatherhood, a dramedy starring KevinHart, was another hit, drawing an estimated 74m member households in its first 28 days. And Q2 alsofeatured our biggest Netflix animated film to date with 53m member households choosing to watchThe Mitchellsvs. The Machines. Last week, Netflix series and specials received 129Emmy nominations. With 24 nominations,The Crown tied for the most nominated series.Bridgertonwith12 nominations was also nominated for Best Drama series whileThe Queen’s Gambitreceived 18 nominationsincluding Best Limited Series.Cobra Kai,Emily In Parisand the finale season ofThe Kominsky Methodwere all nominated for Best Comedy series. Beyond this acclaim, these are also among our popularseries on Netflix. Our non-English content investments are growing bothin scope and impact. Our P&L content expense for this content category has more than doubled inthe past two years. Illustrating how great storiescan come from anywhere and be loved everywhere, part twoofLupinfrom France was our largest non-English title in the quarter with 54m member householdschoosing this title in its first four weeks. Season four ofElitefrom Spain drew 37m member householdsin its first 28 days, while season two of Who Killed Sara?built on the success of the firstseason with 34m households choosing the latest installment of this gripping thriller from Mexico. As discussed in previous letters, COVID-related productiondelays in 2020 have led to a lighter first half of 2021 slate that will build through the course of theyear. In the first six months of 2021, content amortization grew only 9% year over year (as comparedto 17% in FY20). COVID and its variants make predicting the future hard, but with productions largelyrunning smoothly so far, we’re optimistic in our ability to deliver a strong second half slate. Throughthe first half of 2021 we’ve already spent $8 billion in cash on content (up 41% yr-over-yr and 1.4x ourcontent amortization) and we expect content amortization to be around $12 billion for the fullyear (+12% year over year). Our Q3 slate will include new seasons of fan favoritesLa Casa de Papel(akaMoney Heist),Sex Education, Virgin RiverandNever Have I Everas well as live action films includingSweet Girl (starring Jason Momoa),Kissing Booth3, and Kate(starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the animatedfeature filmVivo, featuring all-new songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda. We’re also in the early stages of further expandinginto games, building on our earlier efforts around interactivity (eg,Black Mirror Bandersnatch) andourStranger Thingsgames. We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansioninto original films, animation and unscripted TV. Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscriptionat no additional cost similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games formobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our movies and TV series offering and we expect a long runwayof increasing investment and growth across all ofour existing content categories, but since we are nearlya decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about howour members value games. Product 4We’re constantly innovating across a broad range of areas to improve the viewing experience and better serve our members. That’s why this quarter we globallylaunchedPlay Somethingon television, ournew featurethat lets Netflix do the work when you don’tfeel like choosing what to watch. Recognizing that broadband quality and cost varies around the world,we also improved the Netflix download experience to enable you to start watching a show or film evenif it hasn’t finished downloading. Once you reconnect, you can complete the partial download andkeep watching — also helping members avoid exceeding their data limits. We recently expanded our low-cost mobile-only planto an additional 78 countries across South East Asia and sub-saharan Africa. Like in our other markets,this plan complements our existing three tiers of service. In the five markets where we had previouslylaunched a mobile-only plan, we have found that the mobile only plan has been an effective way tointroduce more consumers to Netflix while being roughly revenue neutral as the lower average revenueper membership is offset by incremental acquisition and generally better retention. Competition We are still very much in the early days of the transitionfrom linear to on-demand consumption of entertainment. Streaming represents just 27% of USTV screen time, compared with 63% for linear television, according to Nielsen. Based on this samestudy, Nielsen estimates that we are just 7% of US TV screen time. Considering that we are less maturein other countries and that this excludes mobile screens (where we believe our share of engagementis even lower), we are confident that we have a long runway for growth. As we improve our service, ourgoal is to continue to increase our share of screen time in the US and around the world. 5Share of Total US TV Time, June 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) The planned combination of Warner Media Group andDiscovery and Amazon’s pending acquisition of MGM are examples of the ongoing industry consolidationas firms adapt to a world where streaming supplants linear TV. The industry has consolidatedmaterially over the years (Time Warner/AT&T, Viacom/CBS, Discovery/Scripps, Disney/Fox, Comcast/NBCU/Sky,etc.) and we don’t believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if atall. While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as “must-have” and we haven’tyet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon. In the race to entertain consumers around the world,we continue to compete for screen time with a broad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok(to name just a few). But, we are mostly competing with ourselves to improve our service asfast as we can. If we can do that, we’re confidentwe can maintain our strong position and continue to grownicely as we have been over the past two-plus decades. Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q2, net cash generated by operating activitieswas -$64 million vs. $1 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was-$175 million vs. $899 million in Q2‘20. FCF in lastyear’s Q2 benefited from COVID-related production shutdowns.We are still expecting full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately break even. As we discussedpreviously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-dayoperations. 2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cashprovided by (used in) operating activities, pleaserefer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unauditedfinancial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6During Q2, we increased our revolving credit facility (which remains undrawn) to $1 billion from $750 million and extended the maturity from 2024 to 2026.We also repurchased 1m shares for $500 million (at an average per share price of about $500) underour $5 billion share authorization. Our main priority is to invest in the organic growth of our business while maintaining strong liquidity and retaining financial flexibility for strategic investments. Ourgrowing operating profit allows us to complementthis priority with a return of capital to shareholders. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In June, the independent sustainability think tankThe Carbon Trustpublished awhite paperexamining the carbon impact of video streaming.Key findingsof the work include:  The average carbon footprint for Europe per hour ofvideo streaming is approximately 55gCO2e, equivalent to driving 250 metres in an average petrolcar.  Devices (TVs, laptops/PCs, smartphones, tablets) makeup the largest portion of carbon emissions from streaming (over 50%), compared to othercomponents like energy from data centers or networks. Good news: Devices are gettingmore efficient over time and total device usage is fairly constant (with Netflix gaining sharefrom linear).  Changing resolutions and other viewing settings werefound to result in only a very small change in the carbon impact. Changing from standard definitionto 4K resolution grows transmission emissions from just under 1g CO2e/hour to just over1g CO2e/hour.  As demand for streaming and other internet servicesincreases, the carbon intensity of these services will decrease over time. This is due to (1)networking equipment becoming less energy-intensive with technological advances, and(2) increased use of renewable electricity. As a reminder, our ESG-related information can befound on ourIR website.

       "  'After a lighter-than-normal content slate in Q1 and Q2 due to COVID-related production delays in 2020, we are seeing the positive effects of a stronger slate in the second half of the year. In Q3, we grew revenue 16% year over year to $7.5 billion, while operating income rose 33% vs. the prior year quarter to $1.8 billion. We added 4.4m paid net adds (vs. 2.2m in Q3’20) to end the quarter with 214m paid memberships. We’re very excited to finish the year with what we expect to be our strongest Q4 content offering yet, which shows up as bigger content expense and lower operating margins sequentially. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 9% and 7% increase in average paid streaming memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding a foreign exchange (FX)impact of +$128m, ARM rose 5% year over year. Operating margin for Q3 amounted to 23.5%, a three percentage point increase vs. the year ago period. This was above our beginning of quarter forecast due to the timing of content spend, as well as lower than forecasted marketing spend. EPS of $3.19 vs. $1.74 a year ago included a $136m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We under-forecasted paid net adds for the quarter (4.4m actual vs. our 3.5m projection), while ending paid memberships of 214m was within 0.4% of our forecast. For the second consecutive quarter, the APAC region was our largest contributor to membership growth with 2.2m paid net adds (half of total paid net adds) as we are continuing to improve our service in this region. In EMEA, paid net adds of 1.8m improved sequentially vs. the 188k in Q2 as several titles had a particularly strong impact. The UCAN and 1ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1LATAM regions grew paid memberships more slowly. These regions have higher penetration of broadband homes although we believe we still have ample runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q4’21, we forecast paid net adds of 8.5m, consistent with Q4’20 paid net additions. For the full year 2021, we forecast an operating margin of 20% or slightly better. This means that Q4’21 operating margin will be approximately 6.5% compared with 14% in Q4’20. The year over year decline in operating margin is due mostly to our backloaded big content release schedule in this Q4, which will result in a roughly 19% year over year increase in content amortization for Q4’21 (compared with ~8% growth year to date). Content Our programming strategy is to provide members with a wide variety of high quality content that’s loved and watched in large numbers. Season five ofLa Casade Papel(akaMoney Heist) and season three of Sex Educationwere two of our biggest returning showsin the quarter with 69m and 55m member households, respectively, choosing to watch these fan favorites in the first four weeks. On the heels of The Queen’s Gambit, we’ve had another limited serieshit withMaidwhich launched just after quarter-end on October 1. We expect this story about living on the poverty line by award-winning playwright and screenwriter Molly Smith Metzler to reach 67m households during its first four weeks. La Casa de Papelwas our first non-English languagetitle to show that - with subtitling and dubbing - great stories truly can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world. While the goal of our local content executives is always to create locally authentic stories that will resonate in their country (likeThe Chestnut Manwhich we expect to be watched by 2approximately two thirds of our Danish members during its first four weeks), Netflix is a global, direct-to-consumer service which enables creators to reach broader audiences - and gives our members an even greater choice of stories to enjoy. There is no better example of this thanSquid Game,a unique Korean story that first captured the zeitgeist in Korea and then globally. Released on September 17, it has becomeour biggest TV show ever. A mind-boggling142mmember households globally havechosen to watch the title in its first four weeks. The breadth ofSquid Game’s popularity is truly amazing;this show has been ranked as our #1 program in 94 countries (including the US). Like some of our other big hits,Squid Gamehas also pierced the cultural zeitgeist, spawning aSaturday Night Liveskitandmemes/clips on TikTokwith more than 42 billion views. Demand for consumer products to celebrate the fandom forSquid Gameis high and those items are on their way to retail now. Our film slate also continues to build with a variety of successful Q3 titles such as action filmSweetGirl starring Jason Momoa (68m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks),Kissing Booth 3 (59m), the last installment in the rom com trilogy, the animated family filmVivo(46m) andBlood Red Sky, a German-language action horror movie (53m). Later in the year, we will shift to reporting on hours viewed for our titles rather than the number of accounts that choose to watch them. There is some difference in rankings, as you see below, but we think engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction. It also matches how outside services measure TV viewing and gives proper credit to rewatching. In addition, we will start to release title metrics more regularly outside of our earnings report so our members and the industry can better measure success in the streaming world. 3* Total hours viewed per title in its first 28 days on Netflix. ** The number of accounts that have watched at least two minutes of that title in its first 28 days on Netflix. Data as of 9/27/21. We’re honored to have garnered the most Emmys ever for any single network or service in a season of television, with 44 (tying CBS’ tally in 1974 when there were only three national networks). This included our first best Drama series win (The Crown), whileThe Queen’s Gambitwon 11 out of 18 nominations, including the coveted best limited series. Both titles are among our most popular ever, demonstrating critical and commercial success. During Q3, we announced our agreement to acquire theRoald Dahl Story Company, pending regulatory approval. This was an opportunity to purchase a beloved and enduring portfolio of intellectual property includingCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,Matilda,The BFG,James and the Giant Peach,Fantastic Mr. FoxandThe Twits, to name just a few. Roald Dahl’sbooks have been translated into 63 languages and have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. Once we close, we’ll be looking to develop even more of these stories into new formats across the live action television and films, animation and pre-school categories. We’ve begun testing our games offering in select countries. It remains very early days for this initiative and, like other content categories we’ve expanded into, we plan to try different types of games, learn from our members and improve our game library. During Q3, we acquiredNight School Studio, the maker of critically acclaimed games likeOXENFREE,to help build out our game development capabilities. 4As a reminder, games on Netflix will be included in members’ subscriptions and will not have advertisements or in-app purchases so game play is purely focused on enjoyment versus monetization. We’re eagerly anticipating the rest of our Q4 slate, which includes a great mix of popular returning English language series likeThe Witcher,You, TigerKingandCobra Kai, big returning non-English series likeSintoniaand the final chapter ofLa Casa dePapel(akaMoney Heist), as well as exciting new movies such as the action filmRed Notice(starring DwayneJohnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds),Don’t Look Upwith an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio,Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep, as well asThe Harder They FallfeaturingJonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, LaKeith Stanfield, Regina King and Idris Elba,Army of Thieves(the prequel to ourhit movie,Army of the Dead) andThe UnforgivablestarringSandra Bullock, Viola Davis and Jon Bernthal. The latest films from acclaimed directors Jane Campion (The Power Of The Dog) and Paolo Sorrentino (The Hand of God) are also coming to Netflix in Q4. Assuming no new Covid waves or unforeseen events that result in large scale production shutdowns, we currently anticipate a more normalized content slate in 2022, with a greater number of originals in 2022 vs. 2021 and a release schedule that is more balanced over the course of the year, as compared to 2021. Product We try many different approaches to see what might help our growth. One example in Q3 was the launch of a free plan for mobile users in Kenya. This plan is a great way for anyone in Kenya with an Android mobile phone to explore Netflix - with access to great content, personalized recommendations, and parental controls. We hope that this encourages more people to sign up for a paid membership so that they can watch Netflix on any device (mobile, TV, or laptop), access more features (e.g. downloads) and enjoy our entire catalog. It will take a year or two to determine if this technique helps our paid membership growth or not. We know that members most value the variety and quality of our content. Great recommendations are key to ensuring they can experience that breadth and diversity. So we continue to invest in our recommendations to ensure members can easily find great stories to enjoy on our service. One example of our ability to surface relevant programming isManifest, a TV series that aired on NBC for three seasons and was subsequently cancelled in June 2021. We addedManifestto our service in the US and Canada during the summer of 2021. In the UCAN region, 25m member households chose to watch this title in its first 28 days and we’ve ordered a fourth and final season given the popularity of the show. Marketing & Communications In addition to having best in class content and a product experience that allows members to easily find shows and movies they love, we also want our programming to be talked about and in the cultural zeitgeist. In September, we held our first global fan event,TUDUM, which featured news, first looksand trailers from over 100 of the most anticipated Netflix films and series of the next 12 months. TUDUM was a new way for us to connect fans with our titles, talent and brand and to drive conversation at a global scale and trended at #2 globally the day of the event on Twitter. Additionally, TUDUM and the 5trailers/content released following the event were watched by fans in over 180 countries, generating close to 700m views and more than 3 billion impressions in less than four days. Competition We compete with a staggeringly large set of activities for consumers’ time and attention like watching linear TV, reading a book, browsing TikTok, or playing Fortnite, to name just a few. As one example of this dynamic, on October 4, when Facebook experienced a global outage for several hours, our engagement saw a 14% increase during this time period. We are still quite small, with a lot of opportunity for growth; in our largest and most penetrated market, according to Nielsen, we are still less than 10% of US television screen time. Our approach as always is to improve our service as quickly as we can so that we can earn a greater share of people’s time. Share of Total US TV Time, September 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $82 million vs. $1.3 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was-$106 million vs. $1.1 billion in Q3‘20. FCF in last year’s Q3 was helped by COVID-related production shutdowns. Year to date FCF is $410m. With production volume ramping successfully and a lower operating margin in Q4, we anticipate Q4 ‘21 FCF to be negative. We continue to expect full year 2021 FCF to be approximately breakeven (plus or minus several hundred million dollars depending on the timing of production starts and related cash spending on content). We anticipate being FCF positive on an annual basis in 2022 and beyond. 2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6As we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repurchased 0.2m shares for $100 million. Our slower buyback pace this quarter reflects the pick up in our M&A activity. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above and beyond our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In March, we committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022 and to reduce our emissions to be in line with the latest climate science, ensuring that our internal reductions are consistent with a trajectory of no more than 1.5℃ of warming. We’ve been making progress on this initiative. We provided an update in Septemberhere.

       "  \"We achieved several milestones in 2021: we had the biggest TV show of the year (Squid Game), our two biggest film releases of all time (Red NoticeandDon’t Look Up) and Netflix was the most Emmy-winning and most nominated TV network and the most Oscar-winning and nominated movie studio of 2021. Full year revenue of $30 billion grew 19% year over year while operating income of $6.2 billion rose 35% year over year. We finished Q4 with 222m paid memberships (with 8.3m paid net adds in Q4). Even in a world of uncertainty and increasing competition, we’re optimistic about our long-term growth prospects as streaming supplants linear entertainment around the world. We're continually improving Netflix so that we can please our members, grow our share of leisure time and lead in this transition. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Revenue in Q4’21 grew 16% year over year with a 9% increase in average paid memberships. ARM1rose 7% year over year on both a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, two percentage points faster than Q3’21 (ex-F/X). Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 8%, a six percentage point decrease vs. the year ago period. The decline in operating margin was expected given our large content slate in Q4 this year. Operating margin was above our beginning of quarter forecast of 6.5% due to slightly lower than forecasted content spend. As a result, our full year operating margin was 21% vs. 18% in 2020, 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1above our 20% guidance forecast. EPS in Q4 of $1.33 vs. $1.19 a year ago included a $104m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We slightly over-forecasted paid net adds in Q4 (8.3m actual compared to the 8.5m paid net adds in both the year ago quarter and our beginning of quarter projection). For the full year 2021, paid net adds totaled 18m vs 37m in 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with more than 90% of our paid net adds in 2021 coming from outside the UCAN region. Nonetheless, our UCAN region added 1.2m paid memberships in Q4’21 (vs. 0.9m last year), marking our strongest quarter of member growth in this region since the early days of COVID-19 in 2020. In APAC, we increased paid memberships by 2.6m (vs. 2.0m in the year ago quarter) with strong growth in both Japan and India. EMEA was our largest contributor to paid net adds in Q4 (3.5m vs. 4.5m in the prior year period) and the region delivered record quarterly revenue, exceeding $2.5 billion for the first time. LATAM paid net adds totaled 1.0m vs. 1.2m last year. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and in others it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net adds performance vs. forecast. For Q1’22, we forecast paid net adds of 2.5m vs. 4.0m in the year ago quarter. Our guidance reflects a more back-end weighted content slate in Q1’22 (for example,BridgertonS2 and our new original film The Adam Projectwill both be launching in March).In addition, while retention and engagement remain healthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels. We think this may be due to several factors including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts of the world like LATAM. 2For 2022, we are currently targeting an operating margin of 19%-20% (assuming no material swings in foreign currency from current levels). Our operating margin outlook is driven by two main factors. First, as seen in the chart below, we delivered above the three percentage point annual linear progression over the past two years (average of four percentage points per year). Second, theUS dollar has strengthened meaningfullyagainst most other currencies. With ~60% of our revenue outside of the US due to our international success, we estimate that the US dollar’s appreciation over the past six months has cost us roughly $1 billion in expected 2022 revenue (as a reminder, we don’t hedge). With the vast majority of our expenses in US dollars, this translates into an estimated two percentage point negative impact on our 2022 operating margin. As we have written in the past, over the medium term we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. In the near term, we want to continue to invest appropriately in our business and don’t want to over-react to F/X fluctuations to the detriment of our long term growth. There is no change to our goal of steadily growing our operating margin at an average increase of three percentage points per year over any few year period. 3Content Our Q4 content slate epitomizes what we strive for: a wide variety of quality TV series and films. We had a number of big hits in Q4. We released new seasons of returning shows likeThe Witcher(484 million hours viewed2),You(468m hours viewed),Emily inParis(287 million hours viewed) and on December 31, Cobra Kai(274m hours viewed*), as well as the criticallyacclaimed limited seriesMaid(469m hours viewed). The dystopian Korean thrillerSquid Game- a late Q3 release that broke through globally early in Q4 - generated 1.65 billion hours viewed in its first four weeks and is now our biggest TV season ever. The fourth quarter also featured the conclusion to one of our most popular shows -La Casa de Papelaka Money Heist(6.7 billion hours viewed over its lifetime).We’re excited to expand theLCDPuniverse with our Korean adaptation,Money Heist: Korea - JointEconomic Area, launching later this year. Over the years, we’ve learned that big hits can come from anywhere in the world (with great subtitles and dubbing), as we’ve seen withLa Casa de Papel,Squid Game, andLupinto name just a few. But our goal with non-English originals is to first and foremost thrill audiences in their home country. And in the quarter, we saw big local viewing for titles such asLove is Blind Brazil,My Namefrom Korea, superhero filmMinnal Muralifrom India and Danish thrillerThe Chestnut Man. Film is incredibly important for our members, which is why our ambition has always been to work with the world’s best filmmakers and stars to create a wide variety of quality movies. We took a large step forward in Q4 on this front with our biggest film slate ever. Our blockbusterRed Notice(starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds) quickly became our most popular movie launch of all-time with 364 million hours viewed in its first four weeks. Other hits this quarter includeThe Unforgivable,starring 2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release.

On Christmas Eve, we released the star-studded satireDon’t Look Up(featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep), which is already our second most popular film ever with 353m* hours viewed. Overall in 2021, Netflix series accounted for six out of the 10 most searched shows globally while our films represented two of the top 10. Google Year in Search, 2021 (Global) In November we debuted our mobile games experience globally on Android and iOS. Members can now discover and launch games from within the Netflix mobile app. Since launch, we released an additional five games, bringing the total to ten for 2021. It’s still very early days but we’re pleased with our progress. In 2022, we’ll expand our portfolio of games across both casual and core gaming genres as we continue to program a breadth of game types to learn what our members enjoy most. Marketing & Communications One of our goals with marketing is to help drive conversation about and passion for our titles. We know that Netflix fans want to dive deeper into what they watch with behind-the-scenes details, interviews, and updates. To make it easier and more engaging for our fans, we’ve launched the siteTudum(named after our “sonic logo”) as a home for extending stories and conversation and further building fandom for our TV shows and films. Product & Pricing Netflix offers a wide variety of TV shows and films to its members, which we know they value. We also work hard to make it easy for members to access this content. For instance, in October, we introduced voice-driven Play Something, first on Amazon Fire TV devices (TVs, sticks, and set top boxes). Now, members can simply say “Play Something on Netflix” or “Play a movie on Netflix” and playback will start 5regardless of whether you are browsing Netflix or another service. If they don’t like what’s playing, simply saying “play something else” or “next” will play the next title in the list. Voice-driven Play Something makes choosing effectively effortless. In December, welowered our pricesin India acrossall four plans. India is fairly unique because pay TV pricing is very low. We believe these new prices will make Netflix more accessible to a broader swath of the population - strengthening our value perception. Our goal is to maximize long term revenue in each of our markets. Competition Consumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time - competition that has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering. While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth some, we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched. This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition from linear to streaming and that with under 10% of total TV screen time in the US, our biggest market, Netflix has tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$403 million vs. -$138 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)3for the quarter was-$569 million vs. -$284 million in Q4‘20. For the full year 2021, FCF amounted to -$159 million, in-line with our expectation for “approximately break-even.” We didn’t engage in share repurchases in Q4 as we funded our acquisition of the Roald Dahl Story Company from cash on hand during the quarter. We anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We’re also targeting $10-$15 billion of gross debt. We finished Q4 with gross debt of $15.5 billion and we’ll pay down $700 million of our senior notes due in Q1’22. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) While our current governance structure has served our shareholders extraordinarily well with a sustained period of substantial growth, we’ve clearly proven our business model: streaming is now an established business, we’re self-funding and expect sustained positive free cash flow, and we’ve substantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margin. So the Netflix Board has decided to evolve to a more standard large-cap governance structure and will recommend several changes at our 3For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6next annual meeting. These include declassifying our board, removing supermajority voting provisions in our charter and bylaws, and enabling shareholders to call special meetings. We will also change the voting standard for our directors in uncontested elections.

       "  \"Our revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show. Streaming is winning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently. While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth - through improvements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing - we’ll be holding our operating margin at around 20%. Key to our success has been our ability to create amazing entertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewing than our competitors. These are Netflix's core strengths and competitive advantages. Together with our strong profitability, we believe we have the foundation from which we can both significantly improve, and better monetize, our service longer term. Growth Outlook Since launching streaming in 2007, we’ve operated under the firm belief that internet-delivered, on demand entertainment will supplant linear TV, and that this transition represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a highly popular and profitable entertainment company. People love movies, TV shows and games; broadband and smart TV penetration continue to grow globally with more and more connected devices; and while hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world’s broadband homes don’t yet, representing huge future growth potential. 1In the near term though, we’re not growing revenue as fast as we’d like. COVID clouded the picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021 was due to the COVID pull forward. Now, we believe there are four main inter-related factors at work. First, it’s increasingly clear that the pace of growthinto our underlying addressable market (broadband homes) is partly dependent on factors we don’t directly control, like the uptake of connected TVs (since the majority of our viewing is on TVs), the adoption of on-demand entertainment, and data costs. We believe these factors will keep improving over time, so that all broadband households will be potential Netflix customers. Second, in addition to our 222m paying households,we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over 100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region. Account sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn’t changed much over the years, but, coupled with the first factor, means it’s harder to grow membership in many markets - an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth. Third, competition for viewing with linear TV as wellas YouTube, Amazon, and Hulu has been robust for the last 15 years. However, over the last three years, as traditional entertainment companies realized streaming is the future, many new streaming services have also launched. While our US television viewing share, for example, has been steady to up according to Nielsen, we want to grow that share faster. Higher view share is an indicator of higher satisfaction, which supports higher retention and revenue. Fourth, macro factors, including sluggish economicgrowth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID are likely having an impact as well. 2Our plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix - in particular the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our members value most. On the content side, we’re doubling down on story development and creative excellence, which we see reflected in big Q1’22 TV hits likeBridgerton(627 million hours viewed for season 21*, our biggest English language series in our history) andInventing Anna(512m hours viewed) - both from our extremely successful partnership with Shonda Rhimes - and films likeTinder Swindler(166m hours viewed, our biggest documentary film ever released) andThe Adam Project(233m hours viewed), which come on the back of our Q4 hitsRed NoticeandDon’tLook Up. On the product side, we recently launched “double thumbs up” so members can better express what they truly love versus simply like - enabling us to continue to improve our personalized recommendations and overall experience. This focus on continuous improvement has served us well over the past 25 years - from our big battle with Blockbuster nearly 20 years ago through the launch and growth of streaming, to the switch from licensed second run TV series and films to original programming, and our development from a domestic business with primarily English language content to a global entertainment service. It’s why we are now the largest subscription streaming service in the world on all key metrics: paid memberships, engagement, revenue and profit. Another focus is how best to monetize sharing - the 100M+ households using another household’s account. This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying our service. Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. And we've always tried to make sharingwithina member’shousehold easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams. While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households. So early last year we started testing different approaches to monetize sharing and, in March, introduced two newpaid sharing features, where current members have the choice to pay for additional households, in three markets in Latin America. There’s a broad range of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing. So while we won’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity. As we work to monetize sharing, growth in ARM, revenue and viewing will become more important indicators of our success than membership growth. Over the longer term, much of our growth will come from outside the US. Traditionally, US entertainment companies have viewed “international” as an export market for US content. But we saw long ago that great stories can be made anywhere and loved everywhere - dramatically broadening the pool of creators with whom we can work, increasing the variety of our programming and better serving local tastes. To support this, we’ve been building out capabilities like creative development, personalization, and language presentation/localization. Netflix is now producing films and TV in more than 50 countries with a high degree of integration in the local entertainment ecosystem resulting in the creation of blockbusters from every region. In fact, three out of our six most popular TV seasons of all time are non-English language titles:Squid Game,La Casa de PapelPart 4 andAll Of Us Are Dead, which 1Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through April 17, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 3launched in Q1’22 and has accumulated 561m hours viewed in its first four weeks. So an important focus is working to extend our lead in this area. Our goal is to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating income even faster (as we expand margins) and generate growing positive free cash flow (FCF). During this period of slower revenue growth, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange (F/X), we aim to protect our profitability and manage to a minimum operating margin roughly in line with current levels (i.e., this year’s 19-20% guidance). Once we’ve re-accelerated revenue growth, we’re committed to steadily growing our operating margin. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Our 10% revenue growth in Q1’22 was driven by an 8% year over year increase in average streaming paid memberships and 2% year over year growth in ARM2.Excluding a F/X impact of -$280 million, year over year revenue and ARM growth were +14% and +6%, respectively. Operating income of $2.0 billion was above our beginning of quarter forecast of $1.8 billion due to lower than projected content expense. EPS of $3.53 vs. $3.75 a year ago included a $162 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Paid net additions were -0.2m compared against our guidance forecast of 2.5m and 4.0m in the same quarter a year ago. The suspension of our service in Russia and winding-down of all Russian paid memberships resulted in a -0.7m impact on paid net adds; excluding this impact, paid net additions totaled +0.5m. The main challenge for membership growth is continued soft acquisition across all regions. Retention was also slightly lower relative to our guidance forecast, although it remains at a very healthy level (we believe among the best in the industry). Recent price changes are largely tracking in-line with our expectations and remain significantly revenue positive. In EMEA (-0.3M paid net adds, or +0.4m excluding the Russia impact), we saw a slowdown in our business in Central and Eastern Europe in March, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Paid net additions in LATAM totaled -0.4M; similar to recent quarters, we believe a combination of forces including macroeconomic weakness and our price changes (F/X neutral ARM grew 20% year over year) were a drag on our membership growth. UCAN paid net adds of -0.6M was largely the result of our price change which is tracking in-line with our expectations and is significantly revenue positive. We’re making good progress in APAC where we are seeing nice growth in a variety of markets including Japan, India, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2’22, we forecast paid net additions of -2.0m vs. +1.5m in the year ago quarter. Our forecast assumes our current trends persist (such as slow acquisition and the near term impact of price changes) plus typical seasonality (Q2 paid net adds are usually less than Q1 paid net adds). We project revenue to grow approximately 10% year over year in Q2, assuming roughly a mid-to-high single digit year over year 2ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period.

We still target a 19%-20% operating margin for the full year 2022, assuming no material swings in F/X rates from when we set this goal in January of 2022. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $923 million vs. $777 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow3amounted to $802 million vs.$692 million. We continue to expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. During the quarter, we completed two acquisitions (leading visual effects companyScanlineand gaming studioBoss Fight Entertainment), which had a -$125million impact on cash. We also announced our purchase of Helsinki-based gaming companyNext Games.We’ve completed the tender offer and expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2022. We finished Q1 with gross debt of $14.6 billion after repaying $700 million of our senior notes. We’re now within the top end of our gross debt target range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $6.0 billion, net debt was $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter, equating to a 1.3x LTM leverage ratio4. Given those uses of cash and our minimum cash target, we didn’t engage in share repurchase activity during the quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We recently published our2021 ESG Report(March 30,2022). We’ve made good progress on ourclimate commitmentsannounced last year - reducing or avoidingmore than 14,000 metric tons of emissions in 2021. This enabled us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 footprint by more than 10% from what it otherwise would have been and puts us on track to cut 45% of these emissions by 2030. We continue to develop our inclusion lens. In 2021, women made up 51.7% of our global workforce5, up from 48.7% in 2020. Half of our US workforce (50.5%) is made up of people from one or more historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds, including Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern, Native American, and Pacific Islander6. That’s upfrom 46.8% in the previous year. The number of US Black employees increased from 8.6% to 10.7% and Black leadership increased from 10.9% to 13.3%. The number of US Hispanic or Latino employees increased from 7.9% to 8.6%, and US Hispanic or Latino leadership grew slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%. As noted in our last investor letter and our2022preliminary proxy, the board has decided to recommend to shareholders that Netflix evolve to a more standard large cap company governance structure.

       "  'Q2 was better-than-expected on membership growth, and foreign exchange was worse-than-expected (stronger US dollar), resulting in 9% revenue growth (13% constant currency). Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product, content, and marketing as we’ve done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience. We’re in a position of strength given our $30 billion-plus in revenue, $6 billion in operating profit last year, growing free cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q2 Results Revenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year (or 13% excluding a -$339 million foreign currency impact), driven by a 6% and 2% increase in average paid memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), ARM rose 7% year over year. The appreciation of the US dollar (USD) vs. most other currencies since our April earnings report was the primary reason for the variance to our revenue guidance forecast. We slightly under-forecasted global paid net adds in Q2 (-1.0m vs. -2.0m forecast and compared to +1.5m in the year ago quarter).  In APAC, revenue grew 23% year over year, excluding F/X. At over $900 million of revenue, APAC is approaching the size of our LATAM business. We added 1.1m paid memberships in the region (vs. 1.0m last Q2). ARM in APAC was -2% year over year on a F/X neutral basis, due to the impact from our price decrease in India last December as well as plan mix, which was partially offset by 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1higher ARM in Korea and Australia. Excluding India, APAC ARM grew 4% year over year on a constant currency basis.  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM increased 13% and 6% year over year, respectively, while paid net additions totaled -0.8m vs. 0.2m in the year ago quarter.  Revenue in LATAM grew 19% year over year excluding F/X and surpassed the $1 billion quarterly mark for the first time, helped by constant currency ARM growth of 15%. Paid memberships were flat sequentially (compared to 0.8m paid net adds in Q2’21).  In UCAN, ARM and revenue each increased 10% year over year, excluding the impact of F/X. Paid net adds were -1.3m vs. -0.4m in the year ago period. Retention improved over the course of the quarter and, while churn remains slightly elevated, it is now back near pre-price change levels. We’ve adjusted our cost structure for our current rate of revenue growth. This resulted in approximately $70 million of severance costs and an $80m non-cash impairment of certain real estate leases primarily related to rightsizing our office footprint. Excluding these items totaling $150 million, and the F/X impact of the stronger US dollar since our April report, operating profit and operating margin were slightly ahead of our guidance forecast. EPS of $3.20 vs. $2.97 a year ago exceeded our guidance forecast of $3.00 due to a $305 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” Our approximately $5 billion of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge against the Euro for net income, but doesn’t affect operating income. Year to date, our gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro debt is $467 million. Q3 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the current uncertain macro-economic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. The US dollar continues to strengthen meaningfully against most currencies at ahistoric pace, withthe Euro recently falling below the US dollarfor thefirst time in two decades, a significant headwind for all multinational US companies. We have high exposure to this unprecedented appreciation in the USD because nearly 60% of our revenue comes from outside the US and swings in F/X have a large flow through to operating profit as most of our expenses are in USD and don’t benefit from a stronger USD. Our Q3 revenue growth forecast of 5% translates into 12% year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Similarly, excluding the impact of currency, operating profit growth would be -3% year over year (vs our forecast decline of -29%) and operating margin would be 20% (vs our forecast of 16%). As we have written in the past, over the medium term, we intend to continue to adjust our business as appropriate given the relative strength of the USD to protect our operating margin and try to avoid immediate actions that we believe could be detrimental to the business. We forecast paid net adds for Q3 of +1.0m vs. 4.4m in the year ago quarter. We continue to expect full year 2022 operating margin of 19%-20%, excluding the unanticipated $150m of restructuring costs in Q2 2noted above and the material movement in F/X from January 2022, as our guidance was set based on F/X at that time (see ourQ4’21 letter). Content, Marketing, and Product Last quarter, we discussed our slowing revenue growth, which we believe is the result of connected TV adoption, account sharing, competition, and macro factors such as sluggish economic growth and the impacts of the war in Ukraine. We’ve now had more time to understand these issues, as well as how best to address them. First and foremost, we need to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix. This focus on improving our core service has served us well over the past 25 years, and remains our north star to drive continuous growth. It’s why we strive for an ever better content, marketing and product experience. Also as a pure play streaming business, we’re unencumbered by legacy revenue streams. This freedom means we can offer big movies direct-to-Netflix, without the need for extended or exclusive theatrical windows, and let members binge watch TV if they want, without having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. This focus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believe to be a significant long term business advantage. Our content offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of member tastes by providing an unmatched variety and quality of titles. Our Q2 slate is emblematic of this approach, headlined by season four of Stranger Things, which returned to tremendous fanreception and was a smash hit by all measures - including an outstanding drama Emmy nomination (along withOzarkseason 4 andSquid Game). In its first four weeks,Stranger Thingsseason four generated1.3 billion hours viewed2, making it our biggest season of English TV ever. Season four also re-ignited interest in past episodes with season one through three experiencing a greater than five-fold increase in viewing in the month after the release of season four (vs. the prior month). Season four ofStranger Thingsalso showcased theeffectiveness of our marketing strategy in driving conversation around our titles. When we deliver shows and movies that members are talking about in large numbers, we can influence pop culture, build passion for Netflix and create an experience that is differentiated and difficult-to-replicate. For example, the show catapulted the 1985 songRunning Up That Hillto thetop of the music charts. Metallicaalso enjoyed a return to the charts in the US and UK with their 1986 songMaster of Puppetsafter beingfeatured in the new season ofStranger Things. The cumulative Twitter volume forStranger Thingscontinuesto outpace bothObi-Wan KenobiandTop Gun Maverick, highlighting the big conversation aroundthis title and reinforcing that our binge versus one week at a time release strategy drives lots of “water cooler conversation.” 2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release for each title; since some titles have multiple premiere dates, whether weekly or in parts, we count the 28 days from each episode premiere date in each country. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 17, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 3Source: Twitter. We also delivered a wide variety of other English language series hits in Q2, including season three of The Umbrella Academy(284m view hours*) and seasonone ofThe Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama, which generated 277m hours viewed and has been renewed for a second season. We’ve also renewed the endearing, UK-produced young adult dramaHeartstopper(67m view hours) for another two seasons. In unscripted, audiences embraced season five ofSellingSunset, which recorded 95m view hours in its first four weeks, while the debut season of marriage reality showThe Ultimatumhad 148m view hours. In unscripted, we are also taking global formats and creating local versions. This quarter, we hadRhythm + Flow France, our rap competition show, which wasa big local success. The winner of season one, Fresh, was formerly unknown, working in a gym. But since his appearance on the show, he has become a star with his song CHOP that he performed in the finale hitting #1 on every streaming service in France. He was also invited to the Les Ardentes music festival where he performed for an audience of 15,000 people - another example of \"The Netflix Effect.\" We’re making good progress in film. The basketball dramaHustle(starring Adam Sandler) was our biggest Netflix movie in Q2 (186m hours viewed) and was loved by critics and audiences alike, followed by the comedySenior Year, starring Rebel Wilson,with 161m view hours. We continue to invest in animated features; building off our initial titles likeOver the MoonandBackto the Outback, we releasedThe Sea Beast(102m hoursviewed*) early in Q3 to audience and critical acclaim. Today, we announced that we will be acquiring leading animation studioAnimal Logic, with ~800 amazing people mostly in Sydney and Vancouver, which will help us accelerate the development of our animation production capabilities and reinforces our commitment to build a world-class animation studio. We’ve been partnering with Animal Logic for two years now, working onThe Magician’s Elephant (directed by Wendy Rogers) and the recently announcedThe Shrinking of the Treehorns(directed by Ron Howard). Together, we’ll create an animation studio that will produce some of our largest animated 4feature films. We’ll fund the purchase from our existing cash balance. The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals and we anticipate closing later this year. We’re building on our lead in non-English programming. We want Netflix to be relevant to audiences all over the globe and our local language titles are a differentiator for us. We focus first on telling authentic stories for local impact, but we see that great stories can travel everywhere. Another example of this In Q2 wasThe Marked Heart, a Colombian series, whichfound a global audience and ended up in the top 10 in 81 countries around the world by its second week. Similarly,The Takedown, a French film, wasin the top 10 in 91 countries around the world by its second week, again showing the power of an authentic story and our ability to serve those stories - with subtitling, dubbing, and personalized discovery - for members to enjoy around the world. While we always have room to improve, we’re very pleased with how far we’ve come in providing so much satisfaction and enjoyment to our members. For instance, in the US, which is one of the most competitive markets in the world, we drewmore TVviewing time than any other outletduring the 2021-22 TV season (see chart below), nearly matching the combined total of the two most watched broadcast networks. And, as Nielsen will announce on Thursday, our share of US TV viewing reached an all-time high of 7.7% in June (vs. 6.6% in June 2021), demonstrating our ability to grow our engagement share as we continue to improve our service. Since our launch of a small selection of licensed mobile games last November, we’ve released new games every few weeks, with the portfolio growing to the current total of 24. The games are all intended to be accessible to broad audiences, and span several genres and categories, including racing with Asphalt Xtreme, the digital version of the irreverentcard gameExploding Kittens, zombies inInto the Dead 2and the knitting for cats inKnittens. We’vehad millions of our members play games through the service and we are learning about what games work for different audiences. We’re adapting our 5licensing and partner-based development activities in response to these learnings. We’ve also acquired three games studios (Night School Studios, Boss Fight Studios, and Next Games) which gives us a range of expertise in multiple geographies to accelerate the buildout of our internal development capacity. We are building a solid pipeline of new games that will launch over the next several years and are excited to see our members engage with these titles. Near Term Focus In the near term, a key priority to re-accelerate revenue growth is to evolve and improve our monetization. In the early days of streaming, we kept our pricing very simple with just one plan level. In 2014, we introduced three price tiers to better segment demand. Going forward, we will focus on better monetizing usage through both continued optimization of our pricing and tiering structures as well as the addition of a new, lower-priced ad-supported tier. Advertising Our lower priced advertising-supported offering will complementour existing plans, which will remain ad-free. Our global ARM has grown at a 5% compoundannual rate from 2013 to 2021, so it makes sense now to give consumers a choice for a lower priced option with advertisements, if they desire it. We recentlyannouncedMicrosoft as our technologyand sales partner and we’re targeting to launch this tier around the early part of 2023. They are investing heavily to expand their multi-billion advertising business into premium television video, and we are thrilled to be working with such a strong global partner. We’re excited by the opportunity given the combination of our very engaged audience and high quality content, which we think will attract premium CPMs from brand advertisers. We’ll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant. Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So, our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one. Over time, our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that’s more seamless and relevant for consumers, and more effective for our advertising partners. While it will take some time to grow our member base for the ad tier and the associated ad revenues, over the long run, we think advertising can enable substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth (through ad revenues). Paid Sharing We’re in the early stages of working to monetize the 100m+ households that are currently enjoying, but not directly paying for, Netflix. We know this will be a change for our members. As such, we have launchedtwo different approachesin Latin Americato learn more. Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023. We’re encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America. 6Simplicity At Netflix, focus remains very important to us. These initiatives - paid sharing and advertising - do introduce some additional complexity, but our approach has always been tokeep our business model as simple as possible within the context of our growth objectives. In this vein, these initiatives are similar to expanding into originals, launching our service across the world, and building our own studio, each of which also increased complexity but are natural extensions intended to enhance our existing business. F/X Neutral Operating Margin Disclosure To provide additional transparency around our operating margin, we’ll now disclose our year-to-date (YTD) operating margin based on F/X ratesat the beginningof each year. This will allow investors to see how our operating margin is tracking against our target (which was set in January of 2022 based on F/X rates at that time), absent intra-year fluctuations in F/X (which have beensubstantial in 2022). As can be seen from the table below, F/X-driven changes to our revenue have a high flow through to operating income (the operating profit impact ranges from ~75% to 80%+ of the revenue impact). This is because the bulk of our expenses don’t change with F/X fluctuations.  Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year. YTD 2022 through June 30, 2022. Note: There were no adjustments to content amortization for the purposes of this calculation, as titles are amortized at the historical blended rate at the time of capitalization. 7Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was +$103 million vs. -$64 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)3in the quarter totaled+$13 million, compared with -$175 million in Q2’21. Cash declined $190m sequentially, primarily due to our Next Games acquisition ($69m) and the F/X impact on cash ($145m). As we’ve discussed previously, we are now self-funding. For the full year 2022, we expect FCF to be approximately +$1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars (assuming no material further movements in F/X). We expect annual positive FCF going forward (with substantial growth in FCF in 2023 vs. 2022) due to our increasing revenue, solid profitability, and the successful multi-year evolution of our content model. We’re now more than a decade into transforming our service from licensed second run content to mostly Netflix originals - including more than five years into building out our internal studio to produce the majority of our original titles (60% of our net content assets on our balance sheet are Netflix-produced). We’re now through the most cash-intensive part of that transition. As a result, our cash content spend-to-content amortization expense ratio peaked at 1.6x (along with peak negative FCF of -$3.3B in 2019) and is expected to be about 1.2-1.3x in 2022 and to decline going forward, based on our current plans, which assume no material expansion into new content categories in ‘23. 2022 estimate based on the midpoint of 1.2x-1.3x range. 3For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 8Gross debt at quarter end amounted to $14.3 billion, within our targeted range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $5.8 billion, net debt totaled $8.5 billion, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA4. Our capital structure policy remains unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (eg, about $5.3 billion based on Q2 revenue). After meeting those needs, our intent is to return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) At this year’s annual meeting in June, shareholders approved proposals to declassify our board, remove supermajority voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings. We’ve also changed the voting standard for our directors to simple majority in uncontested elections. Our governance structure is now similar to other large cap company governance structures. With more than one billion people living with some form of disability, we want to ensure Netflix is as accessible as possible. In Q2, we announced that we are expanding the availability of audio descriptions and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing to a total of 20 languages - work that recently won the prestigiousDr. Jacob Bolotin Award. We’ve also introducednew badges for our titles that have audio descriptions and subtitles on laptop and iOS, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first. Summary Reaccelerating our revenue growth is a big challenge. But we’ve been through hard times before. We’ve built this company to be flexible and adaptable and this will be a great test for us and our high performance culture. We’re fortunate to be in a position of strength as the leader in streaming entertainment by all metrics (revenue, engagement, subscribers, profit and free cash flow). We’re confident and optimistic about the future.

       "  \"Summary:  Revenue, operating income and membership slightly exceeded our forecast in Q3’22.  We had big hits across TV and film in Q3 – launching some of our most watched series and films of all time, including:  Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,Stranger ThingsS4,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, The Gray Man, andPurple Hearts  Our lower priced ad-supported plan launches in 12 countries in November – just six months after our initial announcement. Our existing plans remain ad free.  Netflix has higher engagement than any other streamer – with room for growth:  In the UK, Netflix accounts for 8.2% of video viewing, 2.3x Amazon and 2.7x Disney+1;  In the US, Netflix accounts for 7.6% of TV time, 2.6x Amazon and 1.4x Disney + Hulu + Hulu Live2.  Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix's $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit. After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth. The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us. 1Based on reporting fromBARB, as of September 2022 2Based onNielsen’s Gauge, as of August 2022 Q3 Results Our 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 5% increase in average paid memberships and a 1% rise in ARM3. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), revenue and ARM grew 13% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. The sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to F/X. We under-forecasted paid net additions, which totaled 2.4 million vs. our 1.0m forecast and compared to 4.4m in the year ago quarter.  In APAC, revenue grew 19% excluding F/X as average paid memberships rose 23% year-over-year. ARM was -3% year-over-year, excluding F/X, partially driven by lower ARM in India, somewhat offset by higher ARM in Australia and Korea. We added 1.4m paid memberships in the region (vs. 2.2m last Q3).  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM grew 13% and 7%, respectively. Paid net adds totaled 0.6m vs. 1.8m in the year ago quarter.  In LATAM, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, supported by ARM growth of 16% vs. the year ago quarter excluding F/X. We added 0.3m paid memberships, in-line with membership growth in Q3’21.  In UCAN, our most penetrated market, ARM and revenue grew by 12% and 11%, respectively, excluding F/X. Paid net adds totaled 0.1m (similar to the 0.1m in Q3’21). For Q3, operating income totaled $1.5 billion vs. $1.8 billion in Q3’21. Operating income was above our beginning-of-quarter forecast, partially due to higher revenue, as well as a shift in timing of some spend from Q3 to Q4. As a result, operating margin of 19% was above our 16% forecast. The four percentage point year-over-year decline in operating margin is almost entirely due to the appreciation in the US dollar vs. most other currencies during this period. EPS of $3.10 vs. $3.19 a year ago included a $348 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Q4 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. The appreciation of the US dollar remains a significant headwind for us (and US-based multinationals in general). For Q4’22, we’re expecting revenue of $7.8 billion with the sequential decline entirely due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar vs. other currencies. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Our revenue growth forecast is driven by our expectation for 4.5m paid net adds (vs. 8.3m in Q4’21) and ARM growth of 6% year-over-year, excluding F/X. Our paid net adds forecast assumes that we experience our usual seasonality as well as the impact of a strong content slate, counterbalanced by macroeconomic weakness which leads to less-than-normal visibility. While we’re very optimistic about our new advertising business, we don’t expect a material contribution in Q4’22 as we’re launching our Basic with Ads plan intra-quarter and anticipate growing our membership in that plan gradually over time. Our aim 3ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 2is to give our prospective new members more choice - not switch members off their current plans. Members who don’t want to change will remain on their current plan, without ads, at the current price. We forecast Q4’22 operating margin of 4% vs. 8% in the year ago period. The fourth quarter is typically our lowest operating margin quarter of the year as it’s usually our largest quarter in terms of content and marketing spend. In addition, the aforementioned F/X impact has a high flow through to operating income (~75%-80% of the revenue impact) as most of our costs are in US dollars. Excluding the year-over-year impact of F/X, our Q4’22 operating margin forecast would be 10% vs. 8% in Q4’21. TheUS dollar has strengthenedagainst most othercurrencies at a historic rate this year. Based on our YTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negatively impact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. As a reminder, our 2022 and 2023 operating margin target of 19%-20% is based on F/X rates in January 2022, as we discussed in ourQ4’21 letterand subsequentearnings calls. We’re on track to meet this F/X neutral operating margin objective for 2022 (excluding the $150m of restructuring costs in Q2) and for 2023. With the appreciation of the US dollar though, our reported operating margin would be lower than 19%-20% should the US dollar remain above January 2022 levels relative to other currencies. Over the medium term, we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. Our long term goal remains unchanged - to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating profit even faster (as we expand margins) and deliver growing positive free cash flow. Guidance Evolution As discussed in previous letters, we are increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top line metric. This will become particularly important heading into 2023 as we develop new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing, where membership is just one component of our revenue growth. So, 3starting with our Q4’22 letter in January of 2023, we’ll continue to provide guidance for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and fully diluted shares outstanding for the following quarter, but not paid membership. Similar to our regional membership disclosure, we’ll continue to report our global and regional membership each quarter as part of our earnings release. Content & Marketing We started our original programming strategy about a decade ago as we anticipated that some competitors would eventually stop licensing their content to Netflix. It’s been a huge challenge to build a lifetime of entertainment in just ten years in multiple languages and across so many different genres- series, films, animation, stand-up and non-fiction. And while we’ve had our share of misses, we’ve managed to create a very broad slate with many great series and films, for whatever your mood or tastes, from amazing storytellers around the world. Given everything we’ve learned, we’re confident we can deliver even more member value per content investment dollar over time. One of the best ways to understand the success of our content is by understanding our engagement. So we’re excited that BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board), the leading audience measurement and video ratings organization in the UK, is now reporting the share of video viewing for streaming services and broadcast groups in the UK on a monthly basis. In September, Netflix accounted for 8.2% of viewing, and we have more than 2x the monthly engagement of our next closest streaming competitor. This reporting is similar to Nielsen’s Gauge, which launched in May 2021 when Netflix accounted for 6% of viewing compared to 7.6% in August 2022. Our hope is that other measurement companies around the world will join Nielsen and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming and the viewing share of relevant entertainment companies. We think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles. This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love. As theGoogle Trends chartshows, the ability to watch all ofMonster: The Jeffrey DahmerStoryhelped drive significant interest in the show. 4It’s hard to imagine, for example, how a Korean title likeSquid Gamewould have become a mega hit globally without the momentum that came from people being able to binge it. We believe the ability for our members to immerse themselves in a story from start to finish increases their enjoyment but also their likelihood to tell their friends, which then means more people watch, join and stay with Netflix. Our Q3 content slate was especially strong. In English scripted TV, we kicked off the quarter with Stranger ThingsS4, which generated 1.35 billion hoursviewed4- our biggest season of an English language series ever. This was followed in August byThe Sandman(351 million hours viewed), which was loved by fans and critics alike. Near the end of the quarter, we launched season five of fan favoriteCobra Kai(270 million hours viewed) and limited seriesMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story*(824 million hours viewed) from Ryan Murphy, which is now our second largest English series. We continue to see great success with our non-English programming too, withSquid Gamemaking awards history by becoming the first foreign language title to win an Emmy - withsix awards, including for directing, production design and lead actor. Also from Korea,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, a unique series about an autistic lawyer, has reached #1 on our weekly non-English series list in 28 countries, notching up 402 million hours viewed and making it our sixth largest non-English TV show ever through 28 days.Narco-Saintshas been another huge K-Contentwin this quarter, with 128 million hours viewed since launch.Sintoniahas been a big hit for Netflixin Brazil, with season three generating 38 million hours viewed. And while it is still early days for German seriesThe Empress*, it launched with a very strong start (136 million hours viewed). Our goal is to create authentic local stories for members in the home territory, which we also make available globally. Film is incredibly important to our members. We expanded into original film in 2016 because producing our own movies across all budgets and genres has advantages over the next best alternative: only licensing from other studios in the first pay TV window (the “pay-one” window). Those advantages include first window availability on Netflix (pay-one movies debut generally well after theatrical release), global rights (pay-one movies are licensed by country), the ability to carry the films on Netflix in perpetuity (typically only for 18-24 months for pay-one films) and copyright ownership, enabling us to create derivatives like sequels and to use the intellectual property (IP) in games and consumer products. We continue to complement our original films with 3rd party licensed films - they remain an important and valued part of our service, but they are just one component of our broader programming strategy. We’re pleased with the progress of our original film initiative. The big budget action filmThe Gray Man (254 million hours viewed) reflects the scope of our ambition to create theatrical quality blockbusters that can reach huge audiences on Netflix: 118 million households (many of which are multi person) if you divide the total hours viewed by the film’s run time of 2 hours and 9 minutes. But since we’re not limited by the need to optimize for theatrical attendance, we can also produce a wider variety of films that consumers can enjoy. For example, the romantic dramaPurple Heartswas a hit among our members with 229 million hours viewed. We’re at an even earlier stage with animated feature films but in early Q3 we releasedThe Sea Beast(165 millionhours viewed), which is our biggest original animated 4Hours viewed data is based on viewing in the first 28 days of release for each episode. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through October 16, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10, whereyou can also find our detailed methodology. 5film to date. On the non-English language film side,Darlings(33 million hours viewed), starring Alia Bhatt, launched to rave reviews and huge fandom in India.Loving Adults(67 million hours viewed), a psychological thriller from Denmark, andCarter(65million hours viewed), a Korean blockbuster, were our two biggest non-English films of the quarter and are now our seventh and ninth most popular non-English films ever. We also continue to invest heavily in marketing, with a particular focus on innovative ways to drive conversation around our titles, which in turn boosts engagement for Netflix. For example, our campaigns for Stranger ThingsS4 andThe Gray Mandrove more than9.8 billion and 1.2 billion impressions, respectively, across paid marketing, social media platforms and events. And content forTudum, our global fan eventthat ran for its second year in September, generated almost1 billion views- up over 30% from last year. Beyond TV and movies, we’re coming up on the one year anniversary of our gaming launch. As we’ve said, this will be a multi-year journey for us to learn how to please game players. Our first year was about establishing our gaming infrastructure and understanding how our members interact with games. We now have 35 games on service (all included in every Netflix subscription without in-game ads or in-app purchases) and we’re seeing some encouraging signs of gameplay leading to higher retention. With 55 more games in development, including more games based on Netflix IP, we’re focused in the next few years on creating hit games that will take our game initiative to the next level. More generally, we see a big opportunity around content that crosses between TV or film and games. For example, after the launch of the animeCyberpunk: Edgerunners(49million hours viewed) in Q3use of CD Projekt’s game surgedon PCs. Product and Pricing As we’ve been discussing over the past few quarters, improving our pricing strategy is an important near-term focus. Last week, weannouncedthat we’llbe launching an ad-supported subscription plan on November 1 in Canada and Mexico; November 3 in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the US; and November 10 in Spain. Cumulatively, these 12 markets account for ~$140 billion of brand advertising spend across TV and streaming, or over 75% of the global market5. To start, we’re keeping it simple by offering one low-priced ad plan – Basic with Ads – at a price that’s 20%-40% below our current starting price. So in the US, for example, Netflix will now start at $6.99 per month (compared to $9.99 today). The Basic with Ads plan will have ~5 minutes of advertising per hour, frequency capping and strong privacy protections. The reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice, especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue and operating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue. Finally, we’ve landed on a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing and we’ll begin rolling this out more broadly starting in early 2023. After listening to consumer feedback, we are going to offer the 5Excluding China and Russia, where we don’t operate. 6ability for borrowers to transfer their Netflix profile into their own account, and for sharers to manage their devices more easily and to create sub-accounts (“extra member”), if they want to pay for family or friends. In countries with our lower-priced ad-supported plan, we expect the profile transfer option for borrowers to be especially popular. Competition As we’ve long said, we operate in a highly competitive industry, where people have many different entertainment choices – from linear TV to streaming, YouTube to TikTok and gaming to social media. The silver lining is that the opportunity is very large and growing, and Netflix is still very small relative to that opportunity (for example, ~8% of total TV time in the US and the UK, two of our most established countries). In the 190 countries in which we operate, our $30 billion-plus of annual revenue is roughly 5% of the combined estimated ~$300 billion pay TV/streaming industry, ~$180 billion branded advertising market, and $130 billion consumers spend annually on gaming6. So, we believe that we have a long runway for growth if we can continue to improve our offering steadily over time. As it’s become clear that streaming is the future of entertainment, our competitors – including media companies and tech players – are investing billions of dollars to scale their new services. But it's hard to build a large and profitable streaming business – our best estimate is that all of these competitors are losing money on streaming, with aggregate annual direct operating losses this year alone that could be well in excess of $10 billion, compared with our +$5-$6 billion of annual operating profit. For incumbent entertainment companies, this high level of investment is understandable given the accelerating decline of linear TV, which currently generates the bulk of their profit. Ultimately though, we believe some of our competitors will seek to build sustainable, profitable businesses in streaming - either on their own or through continued industry consolidation. While it’s early days, we’re starting to see this increased profit focus - with some raising prices for their streaming services, some reigning in content spending, and some retrenching around traditional operating models which may dilute their direct-to-consumer offering. Amidst this formidable, diverse set of competitors, we believe our focus as a pure-play streaming business is an advantage. Our aim remains to be the first choice in entertainment, and to continue to build an amazingly successful and profitable business. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $557 million vs. $82 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)7amounted to $472 million,compared with -$106 million in Q3’21. We continue to expect FCF of +$1 billion for the full year 2022, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars and substantial growth in FCF in 2023 (assuming no further material appreciation of the US dollar) . Gross debt at quarter end was $14 billion, within our $10-$15 billion target range. Cash increased $300 million sequentially to $6.1 billion. Net debt amounted to $7.9 billion at the end of Q3’22, or 1.2x LTM 6Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimatesand excludes China and Russia.

We have no debt maturities in 2023. In early October, we closed our previously announced acquisition of leading animation studio Animal Logic. We funded the transaction with cash, which will be reflected in our Q4’22 cash flow statement. There’s no change to our capital allocation approach. Our first priority is to continue to invest appropriately in our business for the long term, including new initiatives such as games and advertising, followed by selective acquisitions. After that, excess cash above our minimum cash levels (equivalent to roughly two months of revenue) will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.

Our Q4 content slate outperformed even our high expectations:  Wednesdaywas our third most popular series ever,Harry & Meghanour second most popular documentary series,Trollour most popularnon-English film, andGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mysteryour fourth most popular film1.  We successfully launched our new, lower priced ad-supported plan in November and are pleased with the early results, with much more still to do.  We delivered on the high end of our operating profit margin target for full year 2022, and we expect to increase our operating margin in 2023 vs. 2022.  For 2022, we finished with 231M paid memberships and generated $32B of revenue, $5.6B in operating income, $2.0B of net cash from operating activities and $1.6B of free cash flow (FCF). In 2023, we expect at least $3B of FCF, assuming no material swings in F/X.  Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters are now co-CEOs of Netflix, with Reed Hastings as Executive Chairman – completing our succession process. 2022 was a tough year, with a bumpy start but a brighter finish. We believe we have a clear path to reaccelerate our revenue growth: continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix, launching paid sharing and building our ads offering. As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building even greater profitability over time. 1As defined by cumulative view hours in the first 28 days 1Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters as our co-CEOs To complete our succession process, Reed Hastings has become Executive Chairman, and Greg Peters has stepped up from COO to become Ted Sarandos’ co-CEO, and a member of the Netflix board. Reed, Greg, and Ted have been working closely together for 15 years, and this makes formal externally how we have been operating internally. More details are here on ourblog. Ted said: “I want to thank Reed for his visionary leadership, mentorship and friendship over the last 20 years. We’ve all learned so much from his intellectual rigor, honesty and willingness to take big bets – and we look forward to working with him for many more years to come. Since Reed started to delegate management to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values and like-minded approach to growth. I am so excited to start this new chapter with Greg as co-CEO.” Greg said: \"I feel humbled and privileged to become co-CEO of Netflix. Ted and I have worked together for many years – building tremendous trust and respect for each other. We\\'re also motivated by the same goal: a desire to better serve our members so that we can continue to grow our business.” In addition to these changes, Bela Bajaria, formerly Head of Global TV, has become Chief Content Officer and Scott Stuber has become Chairman of Netflix Film. Ted said: “Bela and Scott are outstanding creative executives with proven track records at Netflix. In 2022 we premiered many of our most popular series and films in Netflix history, including Wednesday, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Purple Hearts, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, The Adam Project and Harry & Meghan – a testament to their leadership and creativity. I couldn’t be more excited to work alongside them as we seek to delight audiences for years to come.” For full details of Netflix leadership seehere. Q4 Results Year over year revenue growth of 2% in Q4 (10% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis2) was driven by a 4% increase in average paid memberships. ARM3declined 2% year over year, but grew 5% on a F/X neutral basis2. Revenue was slightly above our beginning-of-quarterprojection, as paid net adds of 7.7M (vs. 8.3M in Q4’21) came in higher than our 4.5M forecast, due to both strong acquisition and retention, driven primarily by the success of our Q4 content slate. In addition, the US dollar depreciated vs. most other currencies during the quarter, which resulted in slightly higher than projected ARM. Operating income of $550M in Q4 was down vs. $632M in Q4 ‘21. This was above our guidance forecast of $330M primarily due to higher than expected revenue as well as slower-than-forecasted hiring. Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 7% compared to 8% in Q4’21. This year over year decline was due to the appreciation of the US dollar. For the full year 2022, our operating margin amounted to 18% vs. 2Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchangerate movements. Assumes foreign exchange rates remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. 3ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 221% in FY21. Based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022 and excluding the $150M in restructuring charges in Q2’22, this translates into an operating margin of 20%, at the high end of the 19%-20% target we set inJanuary of 2022. F/X Neutral Operating Margin (Excluding Restructuring Charges in Q2 2022)  Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year (and excluding the $150M of restructuring costs in Q2 2022). Note: Excludes F/X impact on content amortization, as titles are amortized at a historical blended rate based on timing of spend. EPS in Q4’22 was $0.12 vs. $1.33 in Q4‘21. This was below our $0.36 forecast due to a $462M non-cash unrealized loss from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt as a result of the depreciation of the US dollar vs. the Euro during Q4’22. As a reminder, our approximately $5B of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge on the relative value of the Euro for net income. However, it doesn’t affect operating income as unrealized gains or losses are recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” For the full year, we recognized a non-cash unrealized gain of $353M from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro bonds. Forecast As we noted in our Q3’22 shareholder letter, revenue is our primary top line metric, particularly as we develop additional revenue streams where membership is just one component of our growth (like advertising and paid sharing). The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the rollout of major new initiatives (paid sharing and ads) plus current uncertain macroeconomic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. We forecast Q1’23 revenue growth of 4% (8% on a F/X neutral basis). We expect our F/X neutral revenue growth to be driven by a combination of year over year growth in average paid memberships and ARM. This translates into modest positive paid net adds in Q1 ‘23 (vs. paid net adds of -0.2M in Q1’22). Our 3expectation of fewer paid net adds in Q1’23 vs. Q4’22 is consistent with normal seasonality and factors in our strong member growth in Q4’22, which likely pulled forward some growth from Q1’23. In addition, we expect to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1’23 (more details below in the Product and Pricing section). We anticipate that this will result in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2’23 than in Q1’23. From our experience in Latin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing, which impacts near term member growth. But as borrower households begin to activate their own standalone accounts and extra member accounts are added, we expect to see improved overall revenue, which is our goal with all plan and pricing changes. Our long term financial objectives remain unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expand operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. For the full year 2023, as we continue to improve our service, grow our advertising business and launch paid sharing, we expect constant currency revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. We also expect year over year operating profit growth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F/X). We have been targeting a FY23 operating margin of 19%-20% based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022. We now expect to deliver roughly 21%-22% operating margin on this basis (above the 19%-20% range). Rolling forward to F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, this translates into a FY23 operating margin target of 18%-20%. For Q1’23, we expect operating margin to be down year over year (20% vs. 25%) due primarily to the timing of content spend. Content and Marketing People have more choice of films and TV shows than ever so we need to ensure that there’s always something great for them to watch on Netflix, regardless of their taste, mood, or who they’re watching with. It’s why we’re so focused on continuing to improve our content and broaden our slate. 2022\\'s successful slate was the result of having the best creative executives working with best in class creators. Last year alone we launched4:  Five of our Top 10 most popular English language TV seasons ever –Stranger Things 4and Wednesday(both of which hit 1B hours viewed), Monster:The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,Bridgerton S2 andInventing Anna– as well asHarry & Meghan,our second most successful doc series ever;  Four of our Top 10 most popular English language films ever–The Adam Project, The Gray Man, Purple HeartsandGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery– as well asThe Sea BeastandThe Tinder Swindler, our most successful animated and documentaryfilms respectively;  Seven of our Top 10 most popular non-English films ever –Troll(Norway),All Quiet on the Western Front(Germany),Black Crab(Sweden),ThroughMy Window(Spain),The Takedown (France),My Name is Vendetta(Italy), andLovingAdults(Denmark);  Two of our Top 10 most popular non-English TV shows ever–All of Us Are Deadand Extraordinary Attorney Woo, both from Korea. 4For View Hours for these titles, please visitNetflixTop 10. 4We’re also pleased with the progress we’ve made with returning titles. Members watched more Netflix returning seasons and sequels in 2022 than ever before across a broad range of genres – from film (Enola Holmes2,Lost Bullet2 and two365 Dayssequels) and unscripted (Selling SunsetS5 andLove is BlindS3) to award winning drama (OzarkS4 andThe CrownS5),local language series (SintoniaS3,Young RoyalsS2 andAlice in BorderlandS2, whose success pushed S1back into the Top 10 after its launch) and animation (Big MouthS6). It’s hard to think of two titles that more successfully pierced the zeitgeist this year thanStranger Things4 andWednesday. Both pushed old songs into the musiccharts: Kate Bush’sRunning Up That Hillwent to number 1 on Billboard’s Global charts for the first time, 37 years after it was first released, and Lady Gaga’sBloody Marymade it onto the Billboard top40 list for the first time ever, 11 years after it was first released. We get amazing results when we have aWednesday,Glass OnionorMonstermoment with our members. We believe people typically sign up for a streaming service because they’ve heard about a title “you simply must watch” from a friend, seen the excitement on social media or read about it in the press. Generating conversation is our primary marketing goal because we see that it drives acquisition and encourages existing members to watch more, which in turn helps with retention. For Ryan Murphy’s The Watcher, conversation about the series led tofans flocking to the house, aSaturday Night Livespoof and a spike inhome security sales. OurWednesdaycampaign, with all our marketing in Wednesday’s iconic voice, generated 1.5B organic social impressionspre-launch, a record for a Netflix season one. Over time, we hope to have more and more of these moments across film and TV, and to replicate these successes on the games side. It’s now slightly over a year since we launched games on the Netflix service. We’ve madegood progress in that time - creating the infrastructure to deliver games to mobile devices, building a portfolio of 50 games across many genres and acquiring four game studios to bolster our internal production capabilities. In Q4, we launched season four of unscripted seriesToo Hot to Handle,which was a top 10 title for us globally for three consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, we debuted ourToo Hot to Handle game, which has been our biggest game launch to date and is another encouraging sign in the long term opportunity to entertain members with Netflix intellectual property (IP) across different mediums. In 2023, we’ll continue toexpand our offeringwith moregames, with a focus on Netflix-related IP. Product and Pricing As discussed over the past few quarters, we’re working to give people more choice when it comes to price as well as greater control over their Netflix account. In November, we successfully launched our new, lower priced ad-supported plan in 12 countries. We believe branded television advertising is a substantial long term incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Netflix, and our ability to stand up this business in six months underscores our commitment both to give members more choice and to reaccelerate our growth. While it’s still early days for ads and we have lots to do (in particular better targeting and measurement), we are pleased with our progress to date across every dimension: member experience, value to advertisers, and incremental contribution to our business. Engagement, which is consistent with members on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected and we believe the lower 5price point is driving incremental membership growth. Also, as expected, we’ve seen very little switching from other plans. Overall the reaction to this launch from both consumers and advertisers has confirmed our belief that our ad-supported plan has strong unit economics (at minimum, in-line with or better than the comparable ad-free plan) and will generate incremental revenue and profit, though the impact on 2023 will be modest given that this will build slowly over time. Later in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business. While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change for members who share their account more broadly. So we’ve worked hard to build additional new features that improve the Netflix experience, including the ability for members to review which devices are using their account and to transfer a profile to a new account. As we roll out paid sharing, members in many countries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t live with. As is the case today,allmembers will be ableto watch while traveling, whether on a TV or mobile device. As we work through this transition – and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don’t convert to extra members or full paying accounts – near term engagement, as measured by third parties like Nielsen’s The Gauge, could be negatively impacted. However, we believe the pattern will be similar to what we’ve seen in Latin America, with engagement growing over time as we continue to deliver a great slate of programming and borrowers sign-up for their own accounts. Competition We continue to operate in a highly competitive market as consumers have a vast number of entertainment choices. Beyond our direct streaming competitors, we also vie for consumers’ time against linear TV, YouTube, short form entertainment like TikTok, and gaming, to name just a few. The silver lining is that the market for entertainment is huge and Netflix is still very small by comparison. For example, in the more than 190 countries we operate in, our $30B+ of annual revenue compares against the combined annual estimated ~$300B pay TV/streaming industry, $180B branded TV advertising spend and $130 billion consumer spend on gaming5. It’s not easy to build a large and profitable streaming business. But we’re competing from a position of strength, as we lead the industry in terms of engagement, revenue and streaming profit. As a pure-play streaming company, we’re also not anchored to shrinking legacy business models, like traditional entertainment firms, allowing us to lean hard into the big growth opportunity ahead of us. As we’ve said before, beyond revenue and profitability, another way to look at our business is through engagement, and we are pleased to have Kantar join Nielsen – who have expanded their efforts – and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming as well as the viewing share of different entertainment companies in Brazil, Mexico, and Poland. 5Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludes hardware sales. 6As can be seen in the newly reported markets of Mexico, Brazil, and Poland, we are less than 5% of TV viewing. And in our largest markets like the US and the UK, we are still less than 10% of TV screen time. As one of the leaders in streaming across all markets, we’re encouraged by the fact that streaming overall accounts for less than 40% of viewing across these markets (and as little as 6% in Poland). We believe ultimately the vast majority of time spent on TV will happen via streaming, which should provide a long runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. tablet and laptop), all others are TV only. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities was $0.4B in Q4’22 (vs. -$0.4B in the prior year period) and $2.0B for FY22 (vs. $0.4B in FY21). Free cash flow (FCF)6for Q4 totaled $0.3B, compared with -$0.6Bin the year ago quarter. For FY22, we generated FCF of $1.6B (vs. -$0.2B in FY21), above our forecast of approximately $1B. Now that we are a decade into our original programming initiative and have successfully scaled it, we are past the most cash intensive phase of this buildout. As a result, we believe we will now be generating sustained, positive annual free cash flow going forward. Assuming no material swings in F/X, we expect at least $3B of FCF for the full year 2023. We closed two previously announced acquisitions in Q4 - leading animation studioAnimal Logicand games studioSpry Fox. We funded these purchases fromcash on hand. 6Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activitiesless purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. 7Gross debt at quarter end totaled $14B, in-line with our targeted range of $10-$15B. With cash and short term investments of $6B, net debt totaled $8B, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA.7We don’t have any scheduled debt maturities in FY23 and only $400M of debt maturities in FY24. All of our debt is fixed rate. Our capital structure policy is unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (e.g., about $5.2B based on Q4 revenue). After meeting those needs, we intend to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Assuming no material acquisitions, we anticipate resuming our share buyback program in 2023. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Two years ago we increased our focus on sustainability and related initiatives8– building a team of experts, announcing an ambitious environmentalcommitment,and exploring creative-friendly ways to reduce emissions in our productions (which account for more than half of our emissions as a company). As a result,Netflix production sets are becomingmore sustainablethrough cleaner technologies, including electric vehicles and clean alternatives to diesel generators. In 2021, we created theNetflix Fund for CreativeEquity, committing $100M over five years to further develop our pipeline for underrepresented talent. Through the fund, Netflix supports external organizations committed to creating equitable opportunities in the TV and film industries, as well as bespoke Netflix programsthat help us to identify,train and provide job placement for emerging talent globally. To date we\\'ve committed $29M towards these initiatives, supporting over 1,000 up-and-coming creatives and more than 35 programs around the world.
