Top Stock Reports for Amazon.com, Netflix and American Express
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Netflix, Inc. and American Express Co. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
Shares of
Amazon.com
have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date basis (+66.2% vs. +43.5%). Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive.
Robust advertising business contributed well. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings were tailwinds. Amazon’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives.
However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are also concerns. Intensifying cloud competition poses a serious risk.

Netflix
shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+84.8% vs. +28.9%). The company is benefiting from growing subscriber base thanks to a robust portfolio. Crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries, which represents more than 80% of Netflix’s revenue base, is also expected to aid growth.
Netflix’s diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects. It now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023.
However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok is a headwind. Netflix’s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.
(You can

)
Shares of
American Express
have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+6.7% vs. -3.6%). The company’s several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. The Zacks analyst expects the top line at around $60.8 billion in 2023.
Consumer spending on T&E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments. However, with higher utilization of the firm’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the margins.
Marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise. A high debt burden induces a rise in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

Is it foolish to buy Netflix shares?,Gordon Best,2023-08-04,11:00:02,"Image source: Getty Images
Netflix
(NASDAQ:NFLX) is a streaming giant that has revolutionised the way we watch movies and TV shows. But with the share price cooling off after a rally in recent months, are Netflix shares at a potential buying level for my portfolio?
Why would I be interested in Netflix shares?
There are several compelling reasons why investors might still want to consider investing in Netflix, despite the rally we’ve seen.
Growing user numbers
— User numbers have climbed a further 5.9m in the latest quarter, now at over 230m paid subscribers. This is notable given the crackdown in password sharing and changes in the advertising model.
Revenue growth
— In the last five years, Netflix’s revenue has grown at an average annual rate of 20%. This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of streaming, as well as Netflix’s expansion into new markets, such as gaming. Future earnings growth is expected at 20%, despite revenues reducing slightly.
Market share
— Netflix has a dominant market share in the streaming market. The company accounts for over 20% of the global streaming market. It has a strong library of content and is constantly investing in new content. Netflix is also expanding into new regions, such as India and Africa.
What are the risks?
Competition
— As noted, the company is facing increasing competition from other streaming providers.
Disney
+,
HBO
Max, and
Amazon
Prime Video are all growing rapidly, and they are all gradually taking market share from Netflix.
Writer strikes
— Recent strikes from writers in the US have put pressure on future releases. Subscribers may be unwilling to continue if there are no new interesting releases.
Regulation
— Netflix is facing increasing pressure from regulators. Some regulators are concerned about the amount of power that Netflix has, and are considering imposing new regulations on the company.
Saturation
— Netflix is facing increasing challenges in its core markets. In the US, Netflix is facing saturation, and it is becoming more difficult to attract new subscribers.
Debt
— Netflix has a $14.5bn debt, which may concern investors. Despite this, interest payments are well covered, and this does not pose any immediate threat to the business.
Story continues
How are the fundamentals?
Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
— The P/E ratio is a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings a company generates. Netflix’s P/E ratio is currently 43.1 times, which is notably higher than the average P/E ratio for the
S&P 500
. This suggests that investors are paying a premium for Netflix’s growth potential. However, this still remains lower than the sector average of 59.2 times.
Discounted cash flow (DCF)
— The DCF is a measure of future earnings. The current share price of $413.17 is currently 5% above fair value of $393.52. This suggests the recent sell off may be justified as investors take profits at a price they consider fair.
Am I buying Netflix shares?
Netflix is an interesting investment for those looking for exposure to the growth of the streaming market, despite the variety of risks.
I have owned Netflix shares in the past, and think the operating model is a winner in the long term. However, with the recent rally in shares now bringing the price above fair value, I do not want to buy at this level.

"Netflix reworking Microsoft deal, bringing down ad prices - WSJ",Investing.com,2023-07-27,07:27:34,"Investing.com -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is reworking the terms of its advertising partnership with
tech giant
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and slashing ad prices, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.
Under the terms of a deal signed last year, Microsoft provides the streaming group with the technology to place ads on the platform. This service is key to Netflix's $6.99 ad-supported subscription option, which it rolled out in 2022 in a bid to help boost subscriber growth and combat fierce competition in the streaming sector.
The pact included an agreement from Microsoft that it would pay a so-called ""minimum guarantee,"" or a promise that it would deliver a large amount of ad revenue to Netflix. This, in turn, would cover some of Netflix's financial risk, according to the WSJ.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ said Netflix is now working with Microsoft to bring down the revenue guarantee. It added that some Netflix executives are frustrated that Microsoft has failed to sell more ad inventory. The company is also in preliminary discussions to sell ads through other partners, the WSJ reported.
Elsewhere, some ad buyers have recently agreed to pay Netflix around $39 to $45 for every 1,000 viewers, according to the WSJ. Previous reports in the paper said that the fee was previously roughly $45 to $55.
Neither Microsoft nor Netflix immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment.

"Netflix reworks Microsoft pact, lowers ad prices - WSJ",Reuters,2023-07-27,04:10:03,"(Reuters) -Netflix is restructuring its advertising partnership with Microsoft for its lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan and is also cutting ad prices, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.
The streaming company launched the $7-per-month plan with commercials last year in 12 markets, including the U.S., to attract more customers and selected Microsoft as its technology and sales partner for the offering, partly because it offered to pay a revenue guarantee, the report said.
Netflix is now reworking the agreement to reduce the revenue guarantee due to slowing growth of the ad tier, the report said, adding that company executives are frustrated that Microsoft has not sold more ad inventory.
In addition, Netflix has held early discussions to sell ads through other partners apart from Microsoft, and has also offered them better deals, the report said.
Some advertisers have agreed to pay Netflix roughly $39 to $45 per 1,000 viewers in recent deals, according to ad buyers, down from around $45 to $55, WSJ said.
Microsoft declined to comment, while Netflix did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Last week, the video-streaming company reported a lackluster revenue rise which sparked concerns of a longer road to growth from its new initiatives, with co-CEO Greg Peters cautioning it would take ""several quarters"" to see returns from those efforts.

"Investors Heavily Search Netflix, Inc. (NFLX): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks Equity Research,2023-07-26,13:00:12,"Netflix
(NFLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 3.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $3.39 per share, indicating a change of +9.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.3% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $11.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.2%. This estimate has changed +5.8% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.58 indicates a change of +31.3% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.
Story continues
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Netflix, the consensus sales estimate of $8.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.6%. The $33.71 billion and $38.38 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.6% and +13.9%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Netflix reported revenues of $8.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.7%. EPS of $3.29 for the same period compares with $3.20 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.93%. The EPS surprise was +16.25%.
Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Zacks Investment Research"
Should You Invest in Netflix (NFLX) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?,Zacks Equity Research,2023-07-24,13:30:07,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about
Netflix
(NFLX).
Netflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.97, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.97 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy, representing 57.6% of all recommendations.
Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX
Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLX
Check price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>
The ABR suggests buying Netflix, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Story continues
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Should You Invest in NFLX?
In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.8% over the past month to $11.86.
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix may serve as a useful guide for investors.

Netflix gets upgraded at Baird, following Q2 earnings
Baird upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to Outperform from Neutral and raised its price target to $500.00 from $340.00, based on increased confidence in the company's execution of new initiatives such as advertising and paid sharing, as well as a stronger financial profile that is expected to improve investor sentiment over time.
Last week, reported mixed Q2
earnings
, with EPS of $3.29 beating the consensus estimates, while revenues of $8.19 billion came in below expectations.
The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue.
Near-term expectations seem better calibrated following the 2Q print - and in our view, the modest pullback has provided an attractive entry point into a strengthening long-term investment case.
Shopify stock gains on upgrade
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) shares gained more than 2% pre-market today after MoffettNathanson upgraded the company to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $76.00, as reported in real-time on
InvestingPro.
The upgrade is based on early signs of an enterprise inflection, including growing traction from system integrators, higher web traffic for Shopify Plus, as well as new executive hires that will help Shopify sell to the enterprise.
The company is set to report its Q2/23 earnings on Aug 2. Street estimates stand at $0.07 for
EPS
and $1.62B for revenues.
2 more upgrades
Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) shares rose more than 1.8% pre-market today after Stifel upgraded the company to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $725.00 from $505.00.
We view Lam as a prime near-and-longer term beneficiary of HBM-driven DRAM growth, and off rock bottom JunQ memory levels, see a path forward for Lam’s revenue trajectory to outperform consensus starting in calendar 2H.
Story continues
The company will report its Q4/23 earnings on July 26, after the market close.
Baird upgraded Q2 (NYSE:QTWO) to Outperform from Neutral and raised its price target to $39.00 from $30.00. Shares surged more than 2.4% pre-market today.

Tesla
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares took a dive this past week as investors fretted over the
EV maker's
recent price cuts to boost volumes and combat intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. The decision pushed
revenues
up to a record high of $24.93 billion during the three-month period.
But the move also weighed on its gross profit margin from automotive operations, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, which dropped to 18.2% from 18.8% in the first quarter and 26.2% last year. Although that decline was not as large as many analysts had expected, Tesla's stock still slumped after chief executive Elon Musk later suggested that more price reductions could be coming this year.
As far as the headline numbers go, Tesla reported EPS of $0.91 on revenue of $24.93 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.79 cents on revenue of $24.29B.
The price cuts helped the company boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with deliveries surging 86% to 466,140, marking a record quarter for the company.
Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""
Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, and both BofA and Goldman Sachs - which said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain - reiterating their Neutral ratings on the stock.

Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""
Netflix
Meanwhile, Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) crackdown on password sharing between users - and its cheaper ad-supported tier - appear to be working, with the company seeing a ""low"" number of cancellations and adding 5.9 million subscribers in Q2 - well above Wall Street estimates.
However, this trend was overshadowed by softer-than-anticipated
revenue
of $8.2B, even as EPS came in at a far better-than-expected $3.29 (vs. estimates for $2.84). Netflix's third-quarter projection of $8.5B for the top-line figure missed forecasts as well.
Co-CEO Greg Peters warned investors that returns from all of these initiatives would take ""several quarters"" to materialize.
Shares in Netflix took a slide, ending the week down 4% to $427.50.
But Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after what it called ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""
BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:
Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.
Taiwan Semiconductor
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC, on Thursday logged a higher-than-expected
second-quarter
profit on some resilience in chip demand, but warned that a boom in artificial intelligence will not be enough to offset a broader industry downturn.
The New York-traded stock took a quick fall after the results, with American depositary receipts finishing the week down 7.1% to $97.25.
The firm - which is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and also a key supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) - said net Q2 earnings per share fell 23% to 7.01 Taiwan dollars (US$1 = T$31.07), or US$1.14 per ADR. The per-ADR figure came in easily above expectations for $1.07, per analysts polled by Investing.com.
While the year-on-year decline in profit was partially due to a strong performance last year, it also reflects a slowdown in semiconductor demand through 2023 amid rising interest rates and worsening global economic conditions.
Profitability is expected to worsen in the coming quarter, with the chipmaker's gross profit margin set to drop to 51.5% to 53.5% in the third quarter from 54.1% in the second quarter, while operating profit margin is also expected to decline to between 38% and 40% from 42%.
The firm said that it faced increased headwinds from a broader economic downturn, which was keeping chip demand subdued after a bumper 2022. TSMC also struck a less optimistic note on an artificial intelligence-driven boost to chip demand than some of its peers.
Following the results, research firm CFRA trimmed the company's rating to Buy from the prior Strong Buy.
Microsoft
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said 365 Copilot users would be charged $30 per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, and Business Premium when generally available.
After the announcement Tuesday - with higher-than-expected pricing for a very widely used product -
Microsoft shares
rocketed to a record high for the session.
Analysts were generally bullish on the news as well.
Barclays, for instance, called the move ""a major next step for MSFT’s AI monetization. We think the price uplift (53% over E5) is at the upper end of investors’ expectations and should drive shares.” Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) similarly said that the pricing ""represents a significant step-up to existing license costs.""
BofA, meanwhile, estimated this to represent a $1.52B opportunity based on its estimate of 422 million Office 365 subscribers and anticipation of 1% penetration into that user base. It also believes that ""M365 Copilot’s ability to parse through relevant business data"" is a ""critical differentiator to existing AI products.""
Mizuho was also very positive, writing:
We remain confident that MSFT's growth opportunities over the medium term and beyond are greater than many realize, and this includes significant Generative AI monetization. And among June-quarter companies about to report, MSFT remains our top pick. We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PT to $420 (was $390).
After Tuesday's surge, shares retreated and ultimately ended down fractionally for the week to $343.77.

"Fed, Netflix Earnings Cast Clouds Over 2023’s Tech-Stock Surge",Jessica Menton and Jeran Wittenstein,2023-07-22,13:00:07,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s growing concern on Wall Street that the twin engines of this year’s tech-stock surge are at risk of sputtering.

Oil Trader Vitol Doubled Average Pay on Record $15.1 Billion Profit
That was evident Thursday, when the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index dropped by the most in five months as disappointing earnings reports from Netflix Inc. and Tesla Inc. dampened the outlook for the sector. At the same time, strong employment data underscored worries that the Federal Reserve may not be on the verge of ending its most aggressive monetary policy tightening in decades.
And bigger tests are coming soon.
Next week, around 170 companies in the S&P 500 Index, representing 40% of its market capitalization, are set to post results, including tech bellwethers Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. And on Wednesday, after the Fed announces its latest decision on interest rates, Chair Jerome Powell will provide clues on whether investors were correct to wager that its expected quarter-point rate hike will be its last.
“The number one concern for investors in the second half of the year is all about the Fed,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of Wealth Alliance. “If there are more hikes than Wall Street expects, it will be bad for tech and growth stocks. Valuations need to come down.”
Growth stocks are highly sensitive to interest rates, which are used to calculate what earnings in the years ahead are worth right now. Tech has rallied this year as its profits have proven to be resilient and the Fed started to slow down the pace of its rate hikes, even keeping them steady at the last meeting.
After this year’s advance, spurred in part by excitement over artificial-intelligence breakthroughs, valuations have gotten lofty. The Nasdaq 100 has soared 42% this year, and it is trading at 29 times forward earnings. And the gains keep coming - even after posting its worst day in months on Thursday, the index is poised to end the week only slightly lower.
Story continues
Big tech is also crucial to the S&P 500 index, since the companies’ large market values give them the heaviest weighting in the benchmark. The five biggest firms in the index — Apple, Microsoft Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet — trade at a combined 30 times forward earnings, the highest since March 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s nearly twice the multiple for the rest of the index.
Of course, some of that also reflects expectations that big-tech earnings will continue to improve after the companies’ aggressive cost-cutting efforts. In fact, those top five S&P 500 corporations are forecast to show a 16% profit expansion in the second quarter, according to BI. That compares with a 9% earnings contraction for the broader equities gauge.

Other signals bode well for profits in the second half of the year, particularly if easing producer-price inflation keeps bolstering margins, said Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at BI.
“No one is talking about the potential for earnings pressures to continue to ease for the top five companies in the S&P 500,” she said. “That could actually resolve itself, with the rest of the index playing catchup with improving profits. That would ultimately help support equity prices more broadly.”
Microsoft, which is scheduled to report earnings on July 25, raised hopes that AI-advances will start paying off after it announced that its pricing of corporate applications was higher than many investors were expecting.
Yet the steep run up so far this year has made some investors concerned that the stock-market’s expectations have run too far, drawing some comparisons with the buildup to the dot-com crash.
“The tech ‘FOMO’ worries me in the coming months,” said Cheryl Smith, portfolio manager and economist at Trillium Asset Management. “If you look back at the turn of the millennium, the internet certainty transformed our lives, but in 1999 investors could have lost a lot of money getting caught up in the hype betting on them, so you have to be careful.”

"Tesla, Netflix end the week lower after earnings disappointments",Seana Smith,2023-07-21,21:01:16,"Both Tesla and Netflix shares closed out the week lower after releasing disappointing earnings results. Investors are concerned that price cuts are starting to eat into Tesla's margins. Netflix, meanwhile, reported revenue that was a little lighter than had been expected.
Video transcript
SEANA SMITH:
Let's also talk about two big earnings results that we got here just within the last couple of days, Netflix and Tesla. When it comes to these two names, the bar was set pretty high. We've seen a massive run up in these stocks. Tesla beating on both the top and bottom line. Pressure on margins. The price cuts that we've been talking about, that clearly was one of the issues for investors.
When it comes to Netflix, a miss on revenue, also their guidance coming up, a bit light for the third quarter for sales. That was a huge issue. And we saw that reflected not so much in today's trading action, but the big drops that we saw in both Tesla and Netflix yesterday.
MYLES UDLAND:
You know, and we discussed both of these names earlier in the day. And I think conversation got a little sideways there. But one thing that stood out to me with Netflix was that they discussed so openly, that their new-- their main driver of revenue is converting people who already watch Netflix, but just don't pay him any money, which is a fine story. And they are certainly committed to it.
And you can see Netflix really starting to turn the gears of what we captured the market and now we will make everyone pay more for it. But I think on the margins with a name that's up 50% this year, with a name that has a lot of hype behind it and is still working off as we can see in this chart, some excesses that we saw in that 2021, 2022 period, there's still maybe a sense of is that it?
So that's the whole thing. You're just going to monetize people who don't pay you yet. Like, is there no more growth. And maybe Netflix is the first one to admit that everybody got Netflix.
Story continues
SEANA SMITH:
Yeah.
MYLES UDLAND:
They just don't pay me for it. There's no person who hasn't heard of Netflix.
SEANA SMITH:
No, there's no person who hasn't heard of Netflix. But the growth opportunity overseas obviously is a very different story than what we've seen play out within the US. But when you talk about--
MYLES UDLAND:
Show me the RPU, not as good.
SEANA SMITH:
Well, exactly. And that's what I was going to get to. Just in terms of future adoption here when it comes to that ad-based business, I think a lot of that base that they would have captured at least here in the US, obviously their largest market. You would think that most of those people have already converted. So-- and you've got to ask how many more does that mean that are going to be forced off-- do you share a Netflix? What's that looking like?
MYLES UDLAND:
I was going to ask you. I actually I am the payor and my parents are mooching off of me.
SEANA SMITH:
Wow.
MYLES UDLAND:
I know.
SEANA SMITH:
Look at you.
MYLES UDLAND:
Very big of me. Do you guys-- do you guys pay?
SEANA SMITH:
Well, you know-- yeah, we pay our own.
MYLES UDLAND:
You pay for it, right?
SEANA SMITH:
We pay our own.
MYLES UDLAND:
How's the kids behaving on Netflix?
SEANA SMITH:
No one will need to know, though.
MYLES UDLAND:
Is it with Disney Plus, with YouTube? What are we doing?
SEANA SMITH:
We Disney Plus. We YouTube. We do Hulu. And we pay for all of those ourselves, which you could argue is probably not the best financial decision there. But they're all necessary, at least when you have young kids."

Never be left in the dust again
.
Tesla
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) late Wednesday
reported
earnings of $0.91 per share - surpassing the $0.79 Wall Street consensus - on better-than-expected revenue of $24.93, and margins were also less bad than feared.
Still, shares sank 9.7% in Thursday trading.
Excluding regulatory credits, gross margins - which have been closely watched following recent price cuts on Tesla's electric vehicles - fell 6.8% to 18.2% in Q2 from the prior year, better than analysts' estimates of 16.9%.
The price cuts helped the
EV giant
boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with vehicle deliveries surging 86% to 466,140 EVs in Q2, marking a record quarter for the company.
Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""
Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, adding that it leans ""more bullish when thinking about TSLA's positioning vs legacy [original equipment manufacturer] peers.""
Goldman Sachs said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain, reiterating its Neutral rating on the stock. Bofa also reiterated Neutral given risks from price cuts, increasing competition, and near-term macro considerations - while also noting the positive factors of cost reduction and ""its ability to remain agile.""
Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""
Story continues
Netflix
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) dropped 8.4% on Thursday, following mixed
Q2 earnings
: While
EPS
of $3.29 came in better than the consensus of $2.84, revenue of $8.19 billion missed the consensus estimate of $8.27B.
The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue. Buyside expectations were around 4M net subscriber additions.
Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""
BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:
Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.
IBM
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) shares rose more than 2% after better-than-expected
Q2 earnings
of $2.18 a share on below-par sales of $15.58B.
IBM said it continues to expect full-year 2023 constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. At current foreign exchange rates, currency is expected to be neutral to revenue growth.
UBS reiterated a Sell rating and a $110 per share price target on IBM stock, as the analysts believe the reiterated guidance bears a risk: They say they expect revenue to come in at the low end of the full-year 2023 ""implied"" guidance.
BofA, however, kept its Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target by $8 to $160 per share, saying, ""We believe the turnaround at IBM ([revenue] growth and [free cash flow] improvement) will continue. The company has a defensive portfolio, attractive dividend yield and an underappreciated AI portfolio.""
Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday said
earnings per share
plunged 60% to $3.08 in Q2, missing estimates, on lower revenue of $10.89B that squeaked past consensus.
Still, shares ticked up by 1% in Wednesday trading.
The results were attributed to one-off charges related to the banking giant's home improvement lending group GreenSky and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios. Company top brass had already previously warned that this would be a challenging quarter.
Investment banking fees also dropped by 20% to $1.43B, which trading revenue from fixed income, currency, and commodities slipped by more than a fourth.
Like some of its banking rivals, Goldman's investment and trading business has suffered from a slowdown in dealmaking followed by a string of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that have put pressure on the U.S. economy.

Netflix will 'start to hurt' when content stockpile runs out amid strikes: Analyst,Alexandra Canal,2023-07-20,21:01:38,"On Netflix's earnings call, Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated he is ""super committed"" to reaching agreements with striking SAG-AFTRA and WGA members. But amid a falling stock price, how else could streamers like Netflix start to feel the pain from the writers and actors' strikes? Moody's Investors Service SVP Neil Begley gives his outlook on the ways streaming services could suffer more in the long term than traditional media counterparts.
Video transcript
TED SARANDOS:
So you should know that nobody here, nobody within the AMPTP, and I'm sure nobody at SAG, or nobody at the WGA took any of this lightly. But we've got a lot of work to do. There are a handful of complicated issues. We're super committed to getting to an agreement as soon as possible. One that's equitable. And one that enables the industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
That was Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, highlighting the streaming giant's commitment to reaching an agreement on new labor deals. Shares of the company under pressure, closing down more than 8% today after guidance for next quarter came in below analyst estimates. But according to our next guest, Netflix is one of the least at-risk companies in the wake of the strikes.
Joining us now is Neil Begley, Moody's Investors Service Senior Vice President. And Neil, you know, we did see Netflix boost its free cash flow guidance, saying it now expects $5 billion instead of the prior $3.5 billion, citing the strike specifically. You also credited Netflix's wide range of content, their international exposure. But at what point does this strike start to hurt Netflix from a term perspective and even ad revenue perspective?
NEIL BEGLEY:
Well, Netflix is no different from any of the other players in the streaming business or frankly, in the linear business. So for all of them, they've stockpiled content. And when that content runs out, that's when it starts to hurt. They'll smooth out their distribution of the new content for as long as possible. They've stockpiled a lot of new original shows. And they've got lots of library content. But once subscribers start to notice that the originals are not to be found, they'll start-- they'll start acting with their feet.
Story continues
SEANA SMITH:
Neil, you've been covering this industry for quite some time. From your perspective, the demands that the actors and the writers are making versus what we're hearing from the studios, do you think it's likely that this is going to be a lengthy holdout?
NEIL BEGLEY:
I think so. I think it's basically a perfect storm, because you've got a period of time when you've got the linear business in decline and putting pressure on a lot of the traditional media companies. At the same time, they're launching streaming platforms that have experienced nothing but losses now for the most part for, you know, two, three, four years. A lot of them are starting to see the light with regard to potentially breakeven. Some have passed the point of the worst of it, where they're had peak losses. And some are just at that point right now.
So that means these companies are under a lot of stress. And at the same time, on the labor side, these people who are essentially fighting for their lives essentially, their livelihoods, have experienced a time of transition as well. And a lot of the way they get paid is based upon the old guard, where a lot of product is then sold to third parties. And when it's sold to third parties, you can measure the value. When you're putting it on your own platform, it's harder to measure that value and get paid.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
And you said that the DGA contract, which was ratified and signed, coupled with potential new WGA and side contracts, that will cost media firms $450 million to $600 million more per year. How do you see those extra costs impacting these companies and their credit ratings?
NEIL BEGLEY:
So that's on a static assessment of what they produce. If they decide to produce less, obviously, they'll spend less. They also will look to cut costs in other ways, whether they essentially reduce post-production, whether they reduce special effects. They have fewer stars in their programming. Or frankly, they try to pass along those costs to whoever they sell that content to or to consumers.
SEANA SMITH:
Neil, who's hit the hardest? So Netflix is best positioned, although, obviously, not in a great position, given everything that's going on. Who's going to feel it the-- I guess, fastest? And how big of a hit are they going to take?
NEIL BEGLEY:
Well, everybody's going to-- everybody's going to feel it if this is a long strike. However, in the interim, there's actually more money to be made by many of the media companies, because they're spending less on production for a while. Just like we saw initially in COVID. And frankly, with Netflix as well, they generated free cash flow before anyone thought they would, because they weren't producing any new content.
However, once that content evaporates, the cinemas, for example, I mean, they rely on new content only. They have to put people in seats. They have to sell popcorn. And when the new content evaporates. And there's a lull in the new original films coming out, they're going to feel it the Worst, Not only because of that, but because their models are not very well diversified and also because their balance sheets are weak.
SEANA SMITH:
When would we see that low?
NEIL BEGLEY:
I would think that would be sometime in 2024. I believe most of the films that are in the can for a while with the plan that this strike could last throughout the rest of the year are fine.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Yeah. Because I was going to ask about that, because movies tend to have a way longer lead time than, say, some of the cable shows that are on. Some of those more diversified linear networks, like Comcast, for example, right?
NEIL BEGLEY:
Yep. So Comcast is very diversified. So if you've got a very diversified business, they make a lot of money in broadband, for example, that generates essentially 70% of their revenues. They're not as reliant upon their media businesses as many other companies are."
Netflix Declines the Most This Year as Outlook Disappoints,Lucas Shaw,2023-07-20,20:51:54,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. shares fell the most this year after the company projected third-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates, suggesting a crackdown on password sharing and a new advertising tier aren’t yet delivering the sales growth analysts anticipated.

The shares tumbled 8.4% to $437.42 in New York Thursday, the most since Dec. 15. The stock had risen 62% this year through Wednesday on optimism surrounding the company’s new initiatives.
While Netflix grew its subscriber base by 8% in the second water, sales rose just 2.7% to $8.19 billion, coming in slightly below analysts’ projections. That was due in part to foreign exchange rates and to price cuts in some markets. Netflix also generated less revenue per customer in the most recent quarter. The company expects sales of $8.52 billion in the third quarter, compared with the $8.67 billion average of Wall Street estimates.
The results were fine “but not enough to move the stock higher given the move in past three months,” LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield said after the results were announced.
Netflix executives called for patience on a call with Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich. It will take several quarters to realize the financial benefits of paid sharing, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said Wednesday.
“While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders.
The shortfall overshadowed a solid quarter by most other metrics. Netflix added 5.89 million customers in the second period, more than doubling Wall Street estimates, and finished the quarter with 238.4 million members.
Story continues
The results marked the company’s best second quarter since the depths of the pandemic three years ago and far surpassed Wall Street forecasts of 2.07 million new subscribers. Management expects similar growth this period.
The company credited much of the boom to its crackdown on password sharing. In May, the streaming leader started charging people in more than 100 countries to continue sharing their passwords, a key part of its plan to accelerate growth after a sluggish 2022. Viewers using someone else’s subscription can now either pay to keep sharing or set up their own account.
The plan has been controversial with users, and analysts were divided about how it would impact growth. Netflix lost customers in the first half of 2022, prompting a steep drop in the shares and leading to a selloff in other media stocks.
While the company initially warned it would see an uptick in cancellations at the start of the crackdown, new sign-ups are already exceeding cancellations. Netflix said that sales will accelerate in the months ahead, with third-quarter growth projected at 7.5%.
Earlier Wednesday, Netflix also eliminated the lowest-priced ad-free plan, pushing consumers toward a lower-priced, ad-backed service or a costlier commercial-free plan.
While analysts have raised concerns about losses from streaming at many of Netflix’s competitors, including Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., Netflix is delivering higher profit. Second-quarter earnings of $3.29 a share beat the $2.85 a share average analyst estimate, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Netflix raised its 2023 forecast for free cash flow to $5 billion, from at least $3.5 billion previously, as a result of a strike by writers and actors, which has shuttered production and cut spending. However, free cash flow will take a hit next year when productions get back up and running. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos declined to address how the strike would impact the company’s output of new programming.

"Johnson & Johnson, Tesla, Netflix: Earnings movers",Seana Smith,2023-07-20,20:30:31,"Pharma company Johnson & Johnson's shares jump following its earnings beat. Tesla shares slide following an earnings miss and a disappointing earnings call with CEO Elon Musk. Netflix's stock falls on a revenue miss despite huge gains in subscriber growth figures. Yahoo Finance Live anchors Seana Smith and Alexandra Canal break down the earnings data on several top stocks.
Video transcript
SEANA SMITH:
All right. Let's talk about some of the individual names. First up. We got to take a look at Johnson & Johnson, closing the day in the green, up just about 6%. The company reporting earnings here that beat the Street's expectations. They also raised their guidance. Johnson & Johnson saying that it now expects adjusted earnings for the full 2023 fiscal year, $10.75 per share. That was up from its previous estimate of $10.65 a share.
Certainly, something, Alie, the Street was very excited about when you talk about a beat on both the top and bottom line, raising the forecast. Kanter was out with a note saying that there's a lot of strength in their business segments that remains. And they believe it's underappreciated when it comes to the price.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Yeah. Polar opposite of what we saw with Netflix, Tesla, American Airlines. They disappointed on guidance. J&J, they boosted guidance. And that is being rewarded on Wall Street right now. We're also seeing some increased demand for surgeries, especially among those older adults that push that off during COVID. But overall, Johnson & Johnson's really looked at it as a bellwether in the health care sector.
And I think health care is having a moment right now. I mean, we're talking about pickleball at one point, leading to more procedures done, as more people are getting involved in pickleball. We had the first over-the-counter FDA approval for birth control drug. There's just a lot happening right now. And it seems like health care is just very strong. And Johnson & Johnson's results certainly proves that.

SEANA SMITH:
Yeah, certainly. The stock is still down year-to-date but now off just about 4%. Not everyone on the Street was at least as encouraged or somewhat I should-- maybe the better way to put it, still have some questions just about what the business is going to look like here in the near term.
JP Morgan's reaction, they have a neutral rating on the stock. They're still worried about that talc overhang. They're hoping to get a little bit more clarity regarding that impact here throughout the current quarter, the third quarter, but again, taking a look at the Street's reaction, at least for now. We talked about the fact that companies are under pressure to beat and raise their guidance. And at least in the case of Johnson & Johnson, it seems to have satisfied investors for now.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Yeah. We'll see what the back half of the year holds for that, especially with those lawsuits overhanging. Moving on to Tesla. Shares closing way down there more than 9% following second quarter results that were a mixed bag for investors. And the earnings call wasn't much better. Among the things investors were disappointed to hear from the EV maker were slow down in production in the third quarter due to factory upgrades and the lack of specifics given about the start of Cybertruck production.
It's crazy to me that the Cybertruck is what investors care about, because, personally, I just think this is a bit of a side show for Netflix. I think the larger story here is the margin disappointment, also the pricing war that we have going on, Netflix guiding that they'll probably have to continue to cut prices as we see more EVs come to market. And that's not just something that's happening in the US. It's also happening overseas in China.
SEANA SMITH:
Yeah. It's happening overseas in China. This is really a global price war when it comes to EVs. These companies like Tesla trying to increase adoption. Tesla, there were some questions just about the demand picture, how significantly that was deteriorating given the macro environment. So the fact that Elon Musk left the door open to further price cuts, that's one of the big reasons why we're seeing such a massive drop in the stock today.
And like you said, Allie, this has already-- this has been pressuring margins now. This is the second quarter that this has happened. So certainly something that investors, analysts are keeping a very close eye on. When it comes to what's going to be really move the needle here for Tesla going forward, a lot of the excitement in the stock was surrounding its relation here with AI and how much of this is really an AI play versus an EV play and the demand.
Lots of questions about that. And whether or not the massive run up that we've seen since the start of the year of a gain of over 113%, whether or not that's justified. And at least for today, following these results, analysts are still a bit cautious about Tesla's current valuation, saying that it could be a bumpy couple of months because of some of these concerns.
SEANA SMITH:
Yeah. It's an overheated stock, clearly. I mean, Elon Musk, he's one of those CEOs that just gets a rise out of most people. I mean, this quote, he said, ""The Cybertruck demand is so far off the hook, you can't even see the hook."" That is such an Elon Musk quote right there. We're going to be diving deeper into the Cybertruck story a little later on in the show with our auto reporter Pras Subramanian, because there's a lot to talk about when we think about Elon Musk and the future of this Cybertruck. I mean, look--
SEANA SMITH:
You talk about your Elon Musk impression, that was pretty good.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Thank you. I've been working on it, you know, practicing in the mirror.
SEANA SMITH:
I know. You got to debut it. And this is the perfect time. All right. Let's also talk about Netflix, the stock there. I know you are very closely watching here. Closing the day, off just about 8.5%. The streamer fell short of expectations when it comes to its forecast. That, of course, was a big reason why we saw shares under pressure.
There was also a lot of talk about the password crackdown, what that would do to subscriber numbers. On that side of things for Netflix, that was a very impressive report here. It was nearly triple what the Street was expecting in terms of new additions. Whether or not that momentum can continue, I think that's also a question--
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Yeah. That's a big question. And if you think about where we were last year, Netflix lost a million subscribers. So now, we're seeing 6 million added, which is definitely a positive for Netflix heading into the back half of the year. On the earnings call, they did stress that those certain revenue initiatives, like the crackdown on password sharing, like the ad-supported tier, that's going to take time to see the full impact. And it's going to play out in a few quarters to come.
I read a note from Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall earlier this morning. And he said patience is a virtue, especially when it comes to those long-term Netflix investors. So you have to be patient. And you have to wait things out in order to really see the benefits of some of these initiatives.
But we also saw profitability metrics like operating margins, free cash flow come in above those estimates. So compared to a lot of media out there that's a lot of turmoil right now in the industry, they're doing pretty well.
SEANA SMITH:
And also, we haven't even brought up the issue of the Hollywood strike right now on the writers side, on the actor's side. Many analysts out there saying that Netflix is best positioned among its peers, given the fact that it has a very deep shelf when it comes to content, also its international exposure. But you've got to ask the question, I know it's something that you've been looking into, too, how long this strike drags on? At what point are we going to see a material impact on Netflix?
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Yeah. Netflix, specifically, talked about these strikes, was the first question on the earnings calls co-CEO Ted Sarandos. He said, we want a deal. We want to get this done. No one expected this to happen and to last for as long as it's happened. And I think the longer it goes on, the more pressure it's going to put on Netflix and all of these media companies to make a deal.
SEANA SMITH:
Yeah. Certainly, Netflix one of the worst performers in the S&P today."
Netflix stock falls as company says revenue acceleration will take time,Alexandra Canal,2023-07-20,20:00:05,"Netflix (
NFLX
) said accelerating growth is its ""primary objective"" after the streaming giant
saw its second quarter sales and third quarter revenue projection miss consensus estimates
.
But the company suggested that growth would take time, concerns that helped drive the stock down Thursday more than 8%.
""The key is that we delivered revenue in line in Q2 with our expectations, and we're on track to accelerate that revenue in Q3 and further accelerate it in Q4,"" Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann said on the earnings call following Wednesday's results. ""That's really our primary objective around revenue acceleration, and we're set to deliver on it.""
Neumann said revenue growth will be driven by a combination of pricing, volume, and
new revenue streams like ads
— but that those initiatives will take time to mature. Just ahead of the results, the company
quietly removed
its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan in the US.
Netflix rolled out its ad-based offering in November at a price point of $6.99. Neumann said on the call that ad revenue is not ""expected to be a big contributor this year"" and that he expected a ""gradual"" build.
Overall, Netflix added a whopping 5.89 million net subscribers in Q2 — well ahead of estimates of 2.1 million. The gains were largely due to the
crackdown on password sharing
, otherwise known as the paid sharing rollout, which rolled out in the US in late May.
""Most of our revenue growth this year is from growth in volume through new paid memberships, and that's largely driven by our paid sharing rollout. It is our primary revenue accelerator in the year and we expect that impact to build over several quarters,"" he continued, adding average revenue per membership, or ARM, should also improve over time as revenue expands.
Netflix reported second quarter financial results Wednesday that came in mixed as the platform continues efforts to trim costs and boost engagement in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape. (Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
Analysts still bullish: 'Patience is a virtue'
Analysts remained confident in the company's strategy despite the post-earnings stock decline.
Story continues
""Patience is a virtue,"" Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall wrote on Thursday. ""Investors were over-exuberant on paid sharing, and while revenue acceleration will take longer we think it creates an entry point for patient, longterm investors. Price increases and margins are ahead. We maintain our $500 target, Overweight rating.""

Wedbush analysts Alicia Reese and Michael Pachter agreed, writing in a note to clients on Thursday, ""The sharing crackdown and ad-tier have only begun to positively impact results.""
The analysts maintained their Outperform rating on the stock and increased their price target to $525 a share, up from the prior $475.
""We think Netflix is well-positioned in this murky environment as streamers are shifting strategy, and should be valued as an immensely profitable, slow-growth company,"" the analysts said. ""One of the most important takeaways from Q2 results is that Netflix remains laser focused on increasing profitability and free cash flow.""
Tim Nollen, Macquarie senior media tech analyst, maintained his Neutral rating and $410 price target, explaining the share price reaction was the result of heightened sentiment heading into the print:""We think the stock basically got ahead of itself into this report.""

How Netflix can separate itself from its streaming rivals,Rachelle Akuffo,2023-07-20,16:52:45,"Many analysts have been arguing that Netflix may be able to withstand a prolonged Hollywood actors' strike better than rivals due to its pipeline of international content. Jon Christian, Qvest EVP, Digital Supply Chain, tells Yahoo Finance Live that the company benefits not just from having local content to provide to local viewers, but there is ""quite a bit of room"" for growth when it comes to U.S. consumption of international content. Christian also highlights Netflix role in sports, noting how its focus on documentary-style programs instead of live sports is ""creating a connection"" between fans and athletes in a way that hasn't been done before.
Video transcript
- The streaming company sought a beat on earnings per share coming in at $3.29, but just missed expectations on revenue at $8.19 billion USD. Even though still, Netflix is still working to differentiate from its competitors and stay on top of the content game with major difficulties like AI, the Hollywood strikes and diversification of content, Netflix's future strategy could take many avenues.
Qvest is the world's largest media and entertainment focused consulting firm. Let's bring in Qvest US EVP of digital supply chain Jon Christian to dig into what may be Netflix's trajectory going forward. Good to have you on the show here.
So, I mean, obviously, we've come a long way from where Netflix first started when the competition was not this fierce. What is going to be the key then? What is going to be the key value add or differentiator for Netflix at this point of the industry?
JON CHRISTIAN:
Well, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head. So Netflix originally differentiated with their technology platform. They are basically the first in the game in streaming. They are a cloud enabled. And the other advantage that Netflix has over the others is they haven't done a lot of acquisitions.
And as a result, they are literally going off a single media supply chain. And there's a ton of efficiencies that could come off of that. So from a cost perspective, I see that Netflix is definitely going to dive deeper into the technology. There will be a ton of automation on an AI side when it comes to localization and globalization.
Story continues
And I think where Netflix also has a strong differentiator is in their global model. So traditional content creators are creating content in the US, and then localizing it internationally, where Netflix is doing a ton of in territory content creation. And I think that could actually pay off pretty well. And especially with the impending strikes, leveraging the content from international territories and bringing that into the US also could pay dividends.
-
And you raise a good point because with the double strike going on at the moment, when you look at other markets that have really been a boon for Netflix, I mean, you look at some of the Korean language content. We have content coming out of India, Nigerian Nollywood content as well, how much room is there to grow for Netflix in those markets?
I think quite a bit. And not only-- so obviously, the interioritory content, it's a great boon for basically that territory because they actually want to see local talent, not just be dependent on actors from Hollywood.
But I think the surprise to many was how well it was received in the US market. If you just even look at the success of Squid Games and things of that nature, I think there's quite a bit of room. And I think you're going to see the other studios and content creators. They're actually going after that same type of market too.
-
And we've seen a lot of consolidation in this space. A lot of movie companies and streamers trying to figure out about putting some of these releases in movie theaters versus how long they should keep them as actual just streaming products and services there. What is the game play here in terms of what will give them the best bang for their buck. And how they should be thinking about the types of content that they do put out in movie theaters.
JON CHRISTIAN:
Yes. So think first of all is I think if you look at the past two years, it was get subscribers at all cost and create content at all costs. And I think some of the quality was sacrificed as a result in being able to do that. In this particular case in terms of great creation of the content-- and I'm sorry, just one more time, would you mind just reminding me the question?
-
Sure. When you look at where some of these streamers are getting the most bang for their buck and they're thinking of theatrical releases versus keeping them as a series on the platforms.
JON CHRISTIAN:
Thank you. So sorry. So Netflix has been very against the theatrical release because they want it to be a technology platform. And everything was about putting it on the platform. You look at the other traditional studios, what's amazing about what they do is when they create a theatrical release, they're able to recapture all of that cost in the theatrical market, or at least a good portion of that, and not even release it to the streaming platform for a period of time.
They have a release window, and being able to do that. So I really do think that Netflix should think long and hard that if they are going to create theatrical release, feature release, non-episodic content that they should have a strategy to go to the theaters. That at least will allow them to recoup some of their costs, and even potentially have a higher revenue.
And that is that makes them more of a traditional kind of studio. And I know they want to stay on the technology platform. But I think that's a much better route to go than trying to diversify into gaming or something like that.
-
And as they do focus on quality versus quantity, we keep hearing about the next stage perhaps being sports. But very expensive for some of these live sports broadcasting. Is that something that you think is going to pay off for Netflix at this point?
JON CHRISTIAN:
So let's talk about what they have done in sports. So if you look at what they've done with Formula One, what they've done with golf, what they've done with tennis, it's not live, but they're doing documentary style content delivery.
And then being able to do that, they are creating a connection with the fans to basically those particular athletes or personas. And you're feeling very close. Just look at how much F1 is taken off in the US in the recent years. And I think a lot of that is owed-- is owed to basically Netflix and being able to do that.
So people that weren't even watching F1 before are now attached to drivers, understand the different car makers and basically how it works. And now they're attending live events in Austin and Miami and things like that.
And so what they're able to do, and they also have a very rich data analytics platform, they could see how well this is being received. That could give them very informed decisions on if they actually want to get into the market and go into live streaming of sports content. So I do think that is an uncharted territory that could have major dividends for them if they want to get into that game.
-
Definitely want to see where that goes. The documentaries have been fantastic. So it definitely makes sense that would be the next natural evolution. A big thank you there to Qvest US, EVP of digital supply chain. John Christian, thank you for your time this morning.
JON CHRISTIAN:
Thank you so much. Appreciate it."
"Netflix (NFLX) Q2 Earnings Beat, Revenues Rise Y/Y on User Gain",Zacks Equity Research,2023-07-20,16:28:00,"Netflix
NFLX reported second-quarter 2023 earnings of $3.29 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.25% and increased 2.8% year over year.
Revenues of $8.19 billion increased 2.7% year over year but lagged the consensus mark by 0.93%. On a foreign-exchange neutral basis, revenues grew 6% year over year.
The streaming giant gained 5.89 million paid subscribers globally, thanks to a crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries in May, which represents more than 80% of Netflix’s revenue base. The company lost 0.97 million paid subscribers in the year-ago quarter.
Netflix now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023, driven by the launch of paid sharing. However, it anticipates foreign-exchange neutral average revenues per membership (ARM) to be flat to slightly down year over year due to limited price increases over the past 12 months and immaterial revenues from advertising and paid-sharing.
ARM decreased 3% year over year on a reported basis and 1% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis in the second quarter. ARM declined due to a higher mix of membership growth from lower ARM countries and limited price increases over the past 12 months.
Netflix scrapped the basic ad-free plan for new and rejoining members in Canada and is doing the same for U.K. and U.S.-based subscribers.

Netflix earnings: Key takeaways from the Q2 earnings call,Rachelle Akuffo,2023-07-20,16:15:37,"Netflix shares fell after the streamer reported mixed second quarter results. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal listened in on the company's conference call. Canal noted CEO Ted Sarandos's comments on the Hollywood strikes, as well as what was said about how long it will take for the company to see the full impact of its new ad tier and password crackdown.
Video transcript
[MUSIC PLAYING]
RACHELLE AKUFFO:
Analysts are bullish on Netflix, but investors aren't on the same page today as the stock sinks on a weaker than expected outlook. But the streaming giant continued to tout its dedication to revenue acceleration, calling it a, quote, ""primary objective"" on its earnings call. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal listened to that call. And she joins us now for a vibe check. Hey, Allie.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Hi, Rachelle. I'm going to get right into it, my vibe check neutral, not too hot but also not too cold. And that's mainly due to what we heard on this earnings call, which talked a lot about the future with revenue initiatives like the password sharing crackdown and the ad tier not fully priced in yet.
Netflix executives said it's going to take a few quarters to see the full impact of these initiatives. And I think that's largely what's contributing to the stock declines that we're seeing today. Shares are down another 9% this morning. And that's on top of shares falling 8% yesterday on the heels of that earnings report.
Netflix did miss revenue estimates. They also guided to lower Q3 revenue. However, by and large, it was a pretty solid report, especially since some of those profitability metrics like operating margin and free cash flow came in steadily above expectations.
And if you think about the media environment that we're in right now with not one but two strikes in Hollywood, that's a good sign. Ted Sarandos, he's the co-CEO of Netflix. He was immediately asked about the Hollywood double strike on that earnings call last night. Here's more of what he had to say.
Story continues
TED SARANDOS:
So you should know that nobody here, nobody within the AMPTP and I'm sure nobody at SAG or nobody at the WGA took any of this lightly. But we've got a lot of work to do. There are a handful of complicated issues. We're super committed to getting to an agreement as soon as possible, one that's equitable and one that enables the industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
So Netflix is clearly looking for a deal. We've heard from some analysts that say at least in the short term, the strike could actually help Netflix. And in fact, the company did boost its full year outlook for free cash flow to $5 billion. That's up from the prior $3.5 billion, specifically citing the strike.
But clearly from Sarandos's comments, it's not something that they want to see continue. And that brings me to my top takeaways from the call because besides the strike, there was a few other commentary that I want to point out, also revenue acceleration. That is the primary objective for this company. It's going to be driven by the password crackdown and the ad tier. But like I said, that is going to take time to mature. And investors are going to have to be patient.
And I'll quote Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall who earlier this morning released a note and said patience is a virtue, especially for those long-term Netflix investors. Another thing I want to point out is M&A. Netflix said it really wants to just keep producing content not necessarily be a buyer.
However, it would consider M&A if it's a strong IP. So strong intellectual property is what Netflix said could spur some M&A activity there. So overall, Neutral on the call considering we still need time to see how all of this shakes out in terms of those revenue initiatives.
RACHELLE AKUFFO:
All right, so we've heard from Wall Street. What's the word on Main Street on this though?
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
So Main Street, they're very keyed in to the strike. I want to pull up one tweet from a user that said, quote, ""With all those profits, these streaming services can afford to pay a living wage and provide health care to writers and actors.""
So interesting to see that investors are very aware of the strike and the impact it has on these actors and these writers. We heard from actor Sean Gunn yesterday on the afternoon show. He is well known for his roles in ""Gilmore Girls"" along with ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" And he said companies like Netflix and a lot of those legacy media companies, they're operating on an old model that's not accounting for streaming, especially with residuals being the number one issue that actors are fighting for.
And then another tweet that I thought was interesting was calling out the high stock price that we've seen from Netflix over the past few months. This user writing, quote, ""Revenue growth is only 2.7% year over year, similar to all previous earnings since the year 2020 that ranged between 2% and 5% year over year. This cannot justify the crazy stock price and 50 price-to-earnings ratio, but still not enough at all for the crazy stock price.""
So that's just something to call out when it comes to how some of these tech companies have been a bit overheated right now. If we take a look at a six month chart for Netflix, that's up about 40%. And then year to date, we're seeing that up even higher, roughly more than 45% there. So clearly a lot of runway here. So perhaps what's happening now in the market is somewhat of a correction. And I also think expectations were really high heading into this print."
Netflix kills its cheapest plan without ads,Andrew Griffin,2023-07-20,16:11:59,"Earns Netflix (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)
Netflix has got rid of its ‘Basic’ plan, the cheapest option to watch without ads.
Until recently, Netflix had the option to pay £6.99 or $6.99 for its cheapest normal tier, which came with some restrictions including watching only in HD and on one device at a time.
The company had already axed a similar offering in Canada. And now it has removed the option to join that plan in the US and UK.
Instead, users will have to choose between watching with ads – which costs $6.99 in the US, or £4.99 in the UK – or paying the much higher price of $15.49 or £10.99 for the “standard” plan.
People who already subscribed to the basic plan will be allowed to stay on it, so long as they make no changes to their subscription. But the offering will no longer be available to new users.
Netflix had already hidden the option behind a button on its website, and had seemed to discourage people from taking it up.
In an earnings call this week, in which Netflix also announcing surging subscription growth that suggests its crackdown on password sharing is working, the company’s co-CEO Greg Peters said that it was looking to “optimise” its plan structure.

The world's largest video streaming company topped earnings estimates while lagging on revenues. It also provided a downbeat revenue guidance.
The revenue miss and a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast pushed shares of Netflix down as much as 10% in after-hours trading. This has put ETFs with the largest allocation to this streaming giant like

Q2 Earnings in Detail
The company reported earnings per share of $3.29, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 46 cents and improving from the year-ago earnings of $3.20. Revenues rose 2.7% year over year to $8.19 billion and were slightly below the estimate of $8.27 billion.
Netflix added 5.89 million subscribers in the second quarter, taking the global membership to 238.4 million subscribers at the end of the quarter. The growth was fueled by a large number of sign-ups after the streaming giant cracked down on password sharing and the launch of a cheaper $6.99 per month advertising tier.
The company’s Q2 film slate, including Murder Mystery 2, The Mother, and Extraction 2 as well as TV series like Bridgerton season 1, Never Have I Ever season 1, and The Witcher, was a big success (read: Netflix Target Price Up Ahead of Q2 Earnings: ETFs in Focus).
Netflix anticipates paid net subscriber additions in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter. It expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year as it will see “the full benefits” of its password-sharing crackdown and steady growth in its ad-supported plan. Additionally, the company will continue to create compelling shows and movies, improve monetization, boost its video game business and make user experience better.
This year, the company will have more returning seasons than any other streamer with The Crown, Top Boy, The Upshaws, Sweet Magnolias, Heartstopper, Virgin River, Too Hot To Handle and more.
The streaming giant expects revenues to grow 7.5% to $8.52 billion and earnings per share of $3.52 for the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.63 billion for revenues and $3.14 for earnings per share.

Tesla beat profit expectations; Netflix subscribers jump
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell more than 7.3% after it
beat
quarterly profit expectations but said its production could slow in the third quarter because it is upgrading factories. More price cuts for its electric vehicles could be coming as the
EV giant
tries to boost demand amid rising competition from other automakers, potentially squeezing profit margins further.

Netflix
(
NFLX
)
Netflix shares have tumbled 7% in pre-market trading, almost giving up the entirety of its rally the last week,
as its second quarter revenue fell short of forecasts
.
The streaming platform added that guidance on revenue for this quarter was $8.52bn (£6.6bn), also short of expectations of $8.67bn.
However, the company said its subscriber growth reaccelerated as a result of the crackdown on password sharing, and as part of this shift it will be stopping its most basic plan offering to new and rejoining members in the UK. An ad supported plan will instead be taking its place.
“Netflix posted fairly robust Q2 numbers, though the stock had recently proved very strong so there is a little disappointment that they were not a huge beat,” Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.
“Netflix has not upped its prices this year which dampened revenue growth somewhat, but it continues to build scale and grow average revenue per user as more subscribers move to the ad supported tier providing a significant benefit from advertising uplift. Profitability was also much improved as Netflix’s content spend grew far slower than revenue growth.”
Easyjet
(
EZJ.L
)
Easyjet saw its spring profits beat analysts’ expectations on Thursday as demand for foreign holidays boomed in the midst of the cost of living crisis.
The airline reported a pre-tax profit of £203m in the three months to June, £42m more than analysts had forecast, according to the consensus tracked by Bloomberg.
Revenue per seat, a key metric of profitability, rose by 23% year-on-year, with a forecast of a 10% annual increase over the following quarter. Ancillary revenues, which include the likes of customer payments for personally allocated seats, baggage and food, jumped 26%.
Winter bookings were up by more than 100% year-on-year and Easyjet said it had increased its planned capacity by 15% to meet the needs of strong winter demand.
Despite the positive update, shares slipped 3% in London on Thursday.

“As ever, there are potential flies in the ointment, not least of which is the current sector challenges of constrained air space and Air Traffic Control disruptions. The resilience of the consumer had also been a concern given the parlous economic backdrop in the UK, but for the moment there are few signs of holidays being sacrificed come what may,” Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said.
“EasyJet is clearly on a strong flight path, but the share price recovery still has far to go. Despite a hike of 26% over the last year, as compared to a decline of 0.4% for the wider FTSE250, the shares remain down by 24% over the last two years and by 60% from the levels leading into the pandemic, when the share price was nudging £13.
“This latest update should provide significant promise on more immediate prospects, with the market consensus of the shares as a strong hold quite likely to come under upward pressure.”
Tesla
(
TSLA
)
Tesla is down 3% in pre-market trading after it
reported that operating margins had dropped to 9.6%
in the latest quarter, partially driven by increased spend on large products such as the Cybertruck and AI.
The car-maker also revealed that factory downtime would lead to lower production and that there could be further price reductions.
However, second quarter revenue came in at $24.9bn (£19.3bn), topping street estimates of $24.51, with adjusted EPS coming in at $0.91, compared to estimates of $0.81. That revenue figure represents a slight gain from Q1 and a gain of over 45% from a year ago.
Revenue from the core automotive business rose 46% year-on-year to $21.27bn, which was +6.5% sequentially.
On the profitability end, Tesla reported adjusted net income of $3.1 billion, compared to estimates of $2.87 billion and more than the $2.9 billion adjusted net income from Q1.

But in terms of overall production Elon Musk, chief executive, said on the conference call that Q3 production would decrease slightly due to downtime stemming from factory upgrades. It stuck to its 1.8 million unit guidance and 50% annual unit growth.
“Tesla is a leader in a very uncertain automotive environment, which is going through a massive change so still represents a solid company,” Mamta Valechha, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.
Babcock
(
BAB.L
)
Babcock profits plunged on a dispute with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) but shares rose 10% on the day.
The firm reported a jump in annual revenues and said it had made “excellent” progress despite the profit slide.
Revenues for the year to 31 March rose 8% to £4.44bn, while the contract backlog rose 7% organically to £9.5bn.
But operating profits fell to £45.5m, from £226.8m a year previously, after the group was hit by a £100.1m loss on a Type 31 frigate contract. Losses per share were 6.9p, compared to earnings per share of 32.5p in 2022.
David Lockwood, chief executive, said the firm remained committed to reinstating the dividend.
“We’ve made excellent progress this year, with better-than-expected cash generation, margin expansion and double-digit revenue growth,” he said.
“In a world of significant instability, national security has never been more important. With defence making up two-thirds of the group, the combination of capability, availability and affordability we offer is increasingly relevant.”

"Tesla, Netflix pull Nasdaq and S&P lower, Dow ends higher",Chuck Mikolajczak,2023-07-20,09:14:52,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell on Thursday, weighed down by drops in Tesla and Netflix following their quarterly results, but the Dow advanced for a ninth straight day thanks to gains in Johnson & Johnson following a strong annual forecast.
Tesla's shares tumbled 9.74%, its biggest one-day percentage drop since April 20, after the electric-vehicle maker reported a drop in its second-quarter gross margins to a four-year low and CEO Elon Musk hinted at more price cuts.
Netflix slumped 8.41% to suffer its biggest one-day percentage decline since December 15, after the streaming video company's quarterly revenue fell short of estimates.
""The news last night in Tesla and Netflix, while it’s not the end of the world does give people a reason to wake up and go 'wow, maybe I shouldn’t be chasing these names up here,'"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.
""Let me take some money off the table and redeploy it into big boring names.""
The Dow, however, was able to climb as Johnson & Johnson gained 6.07% after reporting results and announcing an annual profit forecast raise.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 163.97 points, or 0.47%, to 35,225.18, the S&P 500 lost 30.85 points, or 0.68%, to 4,534.87 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 294.71 points, or 2.05%, to 14,063.31.
The decline for the Nasdaq was its largest one-day percentage fall since March 9, while the Dow registered its ninth straight session of gains, its longest winning streak since September 2017.
The Nasdaq has surged 34.4% this year to levels not seen since early April 2022, supported by a seemingly unstoppable rally in megacap growth names such as Nvidia and Meta on optimism over the potential of artificial intelligence, a U.S. economy that has proven more resilient than many anticipated and expectations the end of then Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike cycle was on the horizon.

Netflix falls as benefits from password-sharing crackdown to take time,Samrhitha A,2023-07-20,09:11:11,"By Samrhitha A
(Reuters) -Shares of Netflix tumbled more than 8% on Thursday after the video-streaming pioneer's lackluster revenue rise sparked concerns of a longer road to growth from its new initiatives.
The company added nearly 6 million subscribers in the second quarter - almost three times above Wall Street's expectations - thanks to a crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of a cheaper subscription tier that is bundled with advertising.
However, quarterly revenue growth and forecast lagged estimates, prompting co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters to caution that it would take ""several quarters"" to see returns from those efforts.
Netflix shares recorded their second-worst day this year, losing nearly $18 billion in value, on Thursday. So far in 2023, the stock has gained about 48%.
""Netflix needs to squeeze as much juice as it can from different avenues,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said, adding the market was ""realms away from knowing"" if the much-touted ad tier could become the new cash cow.
The company has been fighting off rivals Disney+ and Amazon's Prime Video in an industry that is showing signs of saturation in the United States. Many of the company's new sign-ups are in countries where it charges lower prices.
""Some folks are using the result as an excuse to take some profits,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said.
Analysts remained broadly upbeat on the stock though, with at least 26 of them lifting their price targets on hopes that revenue growth would accelerate in the second half of 2023 thanks to the new money-making initiatives.
They also said the ongoing strike in Hollywood might not hit Netflix's content slate until 2024 and that it could give the company an edge over its peers as it has a solid lineup of shows.
The company also has a big international presence, giving it access to a wide range of non-U.S. shows and shielding it from the strike. Its non-English titles such as ""Physical 100"", ""The Glory"" and ""Alice in Borderland"" have also been gaining in popularity.

""Every other streamer is now increasing prices, while Netflix is now extremely competitive with its ad tier. It is putting all the building blocks in place for future revenue growth,"" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said.
He added the company would also benefit from its move to remove the cheapest plan without ads tier in core markets, which should help support declining average revenue per user.
Netflix on Wednesday raised its 2023 free-cash-flow forecast to at least $5 billion from an earlier estimate of about $3.5 billion as a result of the strike.

Netflix, Tesla to drag Nasdaq lower
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is likely to be in the spotlight Thursday, after both Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), two of the companies that have been behind the index’s outsized gains this year, disappointed with their quarterly earnings.
Streaming giant Netflix reported second-quarter
revenue
that fell short of expectations even after announcing the addition of 5.9 million new streaming customers from April through June. Its stock fell over 6% premarket.
Tesla stock fell 3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk indicated late Wednesday that he would cut prices despite the ""turbulent times"" as part of a price war that has already weighed heavily on the
electric vehicle manufacturer

Crude market steady after official U.S. inventories
Oil prices steadied Thursday after losses this week on the back of a strengthening dollar, making crude more expensive for foreign buyers, and with U.S. inventories falling less than expected.
The
Energy Information Administration
announced Wednesday that U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 708,000 barrels last week, much lower than expectations for a 2.4 million barrel draw.
This suggests fuel demand was struggling in the world’s largest consumer despite the travel-heavy summer season, as it followed a bigger-than-expected build in inventories the prior week.
By 06:30 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $75.43 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.2% to $79.59. Both contracts are on course for losses of around 2% this week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,985.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1213.

But the move also weighed on its gross profit margin from automotive operations, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, which dropped to 18.2% from 18.8% in the first quarter and 26.2% last year. Although that decline was not as large as many analysts had expected, Tesla's stock still slumped after chief executive Elon Musk later suggested that more price reductions could be coming this year.
Meanwhile, Netflix's crackdown on password sharing between users appears to be working, with the company
adding
5.9 million subscribers in the quarter, far above Wall Street estimates. It also told analysts that the number of canceled accounts was ""low.""
However, this trend was overshadowed by softer-than-anticipated
revenue
of $8.2B. Netflix's third-quarter projection of $8.5B for the top-line figure missed forecasts as well. Shares in Netflix tumbled as a result.
2. Nasdaq futures slump
Futures for the Nasdaq pointed lower on Thursday as results from Tesla and Netflix weighed on the broader tech sector.
At 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT), Nasdaq 100 futures shed 141 points or 0.88%, pulled lower by an after-hours decline in shares of the two major tech players that extended into premarket trading.
Story continues
S&P 500 futures also edged down by 9 points or 0.20%, while Dow futures added 31 points or 0.09%.
The broad-based Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its eighth consecutive session of gains on Wednesday, its longest winning streak since 2019. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 climbed 0.24% and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.03%.
3. Johnson & Johnson, American Airlines highlight busy earnings day
A fresh batch of U.S. corporate earnings is scheduled to be released Thursday, with health care behemoth Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and carrier American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) among the biggest brands to report.
Insurer Travelers (NYSE:TRV), investment manager Blackstone (NYSE:BX), tobacco group Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), and regional lender Fifth Third Bank (NASDAQ:FITB) also feature on the results calendar.
Earnings have largely been stronger-than-expected during this latest earnings season, fuelling hopes that this could be a sign that the U.S. economy may be able to engineer a soft landing after a series of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, three-quarters of the firms that have already reported beat Wall Street estimates.
4. Apple testing ChatGPT rival - Bloomberg
Apple is developing a new generative AI program to compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, according to Bloomberg News.
Workers at the tech giant have already constructed a framework, known as ""Ajax,"" the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. A chatbot dubbed ""AppleGPT"" is also being tested.
Shares in Apple touched a fresh record high on the report, while peers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and
Google-owner
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dropped.
California-based Apple
, which has stayed relatively quiet on the subject of AI despite a surge in the technology's popularity this year, did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
5. TSMC pessimistic on hopes for AI-driven boost in chip demand
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2340) (NYSE:TSM) -- also known as TSMC -- posted
second-quarter earnings
that topped estimates, but the world's biggest contract chipmaker poured cold water on expectations that the boom in AI interest will fuel a surge in chip demand.
Net profit at TSMC in the three months to June 30 tumbled by more than a fifth to 181.80B Taiwan dollars, although this was still above expectations of analysts polled by Refinitiv.
But, in a post-earnings webcast, chief executive C.C. Wei flagged that the rush into AI may not be long-term or sustainable. He noted that ""[while] we have recently observed an increase in AI-related demand, it is not enough to offset the overall cyclicality of our business.""
TSMC subsequently slashed its annual revenue guidance, saying it expects the figure to slip by 10% in 2023 versus its previous outlook for a single-digit drop. U.S.-listed shares in TSMC were lower in premarket trading Thursday.
The move stood in contrast to bullish comments earlier this year from the chip industry from Nvidia, one of TSMC's largest customers. Nvidia previously forecast a jump in semiconductor demand later this year, citing the need for computing parts to power AI programs.

Netflix CEO says company is 'super committed' to ending Hollywood strikes,Alexandra Canal,2023-07-19,23:34:34,"Netflix (
NFLX
) co-CEO Ted Sarandos said Wednesday the company is ""super committed"" to reaching an agreement that would end the double strike in Hollywood that has seen actors join writers on the picket line for the first time since 1960.
Still, the executive said there remains ""a lot of work to do"" to reach a deal.
""Let me start by making something absolutely clear. These strikes, this strike is not an outcome that we wanted,"" Sarandos said
during the company's quarterly earnings call
on Wednesday.
""We make deals all the time. We are constantly at the table negotiating with writers, with directors, with actors and producers with everyone across the industry and we very much hoped to reach an agreement by now.""
SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — announced a strike last week after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios.
""Nobody [at Netflix], nobody within AMPTP, and I'm sure nobody at SAG or the WGA took any of this lightly. But we've got a lot of work to do,"" Sarandos added.
""There are a handful of complicated issues. We're super committed to getting to an agreement as soon as possible. One that's equitable and one that enables the industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future.""

Sarandos added the strikes are personal to him given his father was a union electrician.
""That union was very much a part of our lives when I was growing up. I also remember on more than one occasion my dad being out on strike. And I remember that because it takes an enormous toll on your family financially and emotionally,"" he said.
Netflix
reported mixed results
on Wednesday, but some profitability metrics like operating margin and free cash flow were better than analysts had expected.
Story continues
Free cash flow came in at $1.34 billion for the quarter, significantly above consensus estimates for $542 million. Netflix also boosted its full-year free cash flow guidance to $5 billion from $3.5 billion, citing the impact of the Hollywood strikes.
""We expect positive and growing free cash flow trajectory in the years ahead,"" Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann said on the call, adding there could be some ""near-term lumpiness"" due to the strikes.
The streamer said it plans to keep content spending flat at $17 billion through 2024.
'Move forward'
According to
a new report by Moody's
released on Monday, Netflix is among the best-positioned companies in the event of a prolonged work stoppage, along with Comcast (
CMCSA
), Fox (
FOXA
), Sony Group (
SONY
), Amazon (
AMZN
), and Apple (
AAPL
).
""Major studios, network owners and streamers that are well-diversified by business, content genre (news and sports) or by geographic production and library, and have relatively strong balance sheets are least at risk,"" the report said.
Sarandos reiterated that Netflix's wide range of content will help the platform weather the strikes, but said bluntly, ""That's beside the point. The real point is we need to get to this strike to a conclusion so that we can all move forward.""

The executive's comments come as companies like Netflix have been heavily criticized by actors, who are fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go direct to streaming.
""Part of the problem is that we're operating off of the old system,"" actor Sean Gunn told
Yahoo Finance Live
on Thursday. ""It used to be very equitable for actors to participate in the profit sharing when there [were] shows that are in syndication. ...Well, the streamers came along, and they changed the whole model of how business is done. But they continue operating off the old model.""

SAG has proposed that its members share in the revenue generated by streaming platforms when performances are shown, which the studios rejected, according to the
negotiation document.
""I think a fair deal is percentages,"" Gunn said. ""We're not asking for a flat sum. We want a percentage. That's fair because then when [the studios] cry, 'Oh, our profits are down, we're not making as much,' then okay, we'll participate in that too. We just want an appropriate portion of the profits that you're making.""

Let's take a look at a couple of names trending after hours. United, Las Vegas Sands, Netflix, and Tesla we've got on our board here. Let's kick it off with United, the only stock-- well, I guess Tesla is now in the green too. But United posing the biggest gain that we're seeing here in extended trading among this group. Up nearly 3%.
Solid report here from the airliner. They raised their full year outlook. They cited strong fares, solid demand. Also, this pent up demand for international travel, that's been a big boost to results here as of late. United also saying that their planes-- they expect their planes to remain full following the very important summer travel season.
Adjusted profit for the quarter, $5.03. That was a big beat revenue, rising to 14.18 billion. We're looking at a gain for United of just about 18% over the last three months. Year-to-date it's up about 45%, certainly. The airliners among the outperformers as consumers continue to spend on experiences and this group benefiting.
Let's take a look at Las Vegas Sands. That's under a bit of pressure here. But the results for the quarter, it actually wasn't that bad. Taking a look at these numbers, the company actually swinging to a profit, beating expectations. Sales coming in at 2.54 billion.
The company also reinstating its dividend. They had suspended their dividend at the start of COVID. But this is a stock that's already up about 24% year-to-date over the last year, looking at a gain of just about 67%. So a lot of this optimism, perhaps, already priced in.
Let's take a look at Netflix, another mover here in extended trading. When it comes to why we're looking at losses of about 4%, it all comes down to guidance at third quarter sales forecast coming in just a bit short. For the quarter though, the numbers were pretty strong, especially when it comes to Net Ads here.
Subscriber numbers-- [? look at ?] the company adding 5.89 million subscribers. That was nearly triple the Street's estimates here. The company also making some comments here in regards to the strike, saying that they expect the strike to lower cost by about $1.5 billion this year because they're spending less on content.
And rounding it out real quick with Tesla. The stock up just about 1/2 of a percent in extended trading. A miss here on margins. That's going to be a key in this earnings call. But they did beat on the top end bottom lines. Over the last three months, looking gains about 61% [INAUDIBLE]."
"Netflix earnings: Streamer 'building momentum' with password sharing crackdown, ad tier, analyst says",Brian Sozzi,2023-07-19,21:21:20,"Netflix's second-quarter results showed the streamer's earnings beat Street estimates, but revenue missed. However,
subscriber growth surged
. Third Bridge Group Sector Analyst Jamie Lumley notes that investors were concerned with how the launch of a new ad tier coupled with the recent password-sharing crackdown would impact subscriber numbers. Lumley explains that with 5.9 million new subscribers added this quarter, that Netflix is ""building momentum"" on both initiatives."
Netflix sharing crackdown triggers jump in subscribers,Gareth Corfield,2023-07-19,21:20:19,"Netflix is targeting an estimated 100m households worldwide who watch Netflix shows, including Squid Game, without paying - Noh Juhan | Netflix
Netflix has posted a jump in subscriber numbers as the streaming giant’s crackdown on password sharing starts to pay off.
The US tech giant posted a 5.9m increase in subscriptions in Europe, beating analysts’ predictions of 2.07m by more than double and propelling the company to record subscriber numbers.
It comes after Netflix rolled out
tough new rules
requiring customers to pay an additional charge to share their account with another household.
The move, first initiated in May, is aimed at targeting the estimated 100m households worldwide who watch Netflix shows without paying.
It marks an effort to revive growth at the streaming service after years of a lax policy towards password sharing.
The “extra member” charge, priced at £4.99 in the UK, is expected to
drive even more customers to Netflix’s ad-funded tier
.
Netflix now has 238.4m members, an increase of 8pc from a year ago.
The rise in subscriber numbers will come as a boon to the company, which is grappling with an
industry-wide slowdown
in the streaming market.
The maker of
The Crown
and
Squid Game
announced its first decline in subscriber numbers in a decade last year, amid tough competition from rivals such as Disney+ and Amazon Prime.
After launching its ad-funded tier, Netflix also cut prices in more than 30 countries in a bid to rekindle growth, acknowledging the cost-of-living crisis that has forced consumers to tighten their belts.
Overall, Netflix’s sales increased 2.7pc to $8.18bn (£6.32bn), below forecasts of $8.3bn in the three months to the end of June. Net profit increased 10pc to $1.44bn.
Netflix’s share price slumped by more than 7pc in after hours trading following the update.
Analysts and investors will have a close eye on how Netflix will be impacted by a wave of
industrial action across Hollywood
.
Both the Writers Guild of America and actors union SAGAFTRA have walked out for the first time in 60 years amid a row over pay and the looming threat of AI.
Bosses said they expected cashflow “lumpiness” over the next year as a result of the strikes, signalling the breadth of their potential impact.
Story continues
The strikes have led to a shutdown in production across Hollywood and sparked fears of a drought in upcoming blockbusters and TV series.
Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive of Netflix, has previously played down the impact of the walkouts, insisting that the company had a “pretty robust slate of releases” that would help it weather the storm.
Recent releases from the streaming giant include
The Deepest Breath
, a documentary about the dangerous world of freediving.
In January, Netflix founder
Reed Hastings stood down as chief executive
, becoming executive chairman instead. Greg Peters was elevated to the position of co-chief executive, alongside Mr Sarandos.
Earlier this year the company also announced it was shutting down its mail-order DVD service that launched its business 25 years ago."
Netflix (NFLX) Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates,Zacks Equity Research,2023-07-19,21:15:07,"Netflix (NFLX) came out with quarterly earnings of $3.29 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.83 per share. This compares to earnings of $3.20 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16.25%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this internet video service would post earnings of $2.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.88, delivering a surprise of 1.77%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.
Netflix , which belongs to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, posted revenues of $8.19 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.93%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.97 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Netflix shares have added about 61% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 18.6%.
What's Next for Netflix?
While Netflix has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Story continues
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Netflix: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.14 on $8.63 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.30 on $33.95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Broadcast Radio and Television is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the same industry, Nexstar Broadcasting Group (NXST), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 8.
This television broadcaster is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -48.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.
Nexstar Broadcasting Group's revenues are expected to be $1.25 billion, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.

"Netflix stock trades lower on Q2 earnings, revenue guidance",Seana Smith,2023-07-19,20:30:04,"Netflix reported mixed results in its second quarter. The streamer's earnings topped analyst estimates, but revenue missed. The revenue guidance for the third quarter also disappointed some investors. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the report.
Video transcript
SEANA SMITH:
And we want to get over to Netflix earnings just crossing the wires right now. And taking a look at how shares are trading after hours. Off just about 3%. A big reason why we're seeing some pressure on this stock has to do with the forecast. The third quarter sales forecast lagging the Street's estimates. Netflix seeing revenue of 8 and 1/2 billion. The estimate from the Street was for $8.67 billion.
But when it comes to the second quarter, the standout number for me is the paid streamer ads, the subscribers that they added during the quarter. 5.9 million in the second quarter blowing past the Street's expectations of just over 2 million. Really showing that the crackdown on password sharing, offering a huge boost here for Netflix for its subscriber numbers. For the sales numbers, for the second quarter, that came in at a slight miss-- $8.19 billion. Estimate on the Street was for 8.29 billion.
When it comes to EPS, that was a big beat here from Netflix. But [INAUDIBLE] my two takeaways is that forecast. That's why we're seeing the pressure on the stock here after hours, but the subscriber beat and by the magnitude of that subscribe beat is certainly something to be a little bit encouraged about.
-
I'm going to take the other side. I guess I understand-- I mean, I'm actually on your side. I get the market's reaction. What I'm looking at-- operating profit margin up year over year. 22.3 versus 19.8 instantly tells me their issue or their focus on bringing more profits out of their subscriber base is working to your point. Those net ads at 5.8 million-- that is a huge number. Telling, at least for me, that people are willing to pay and pay more to use Netflix.
Story continues
That was a concern, I think, coming into this Netflix quarter, are people willing to pay and pay more to stay on the service? And last but not least, along those lines, 6% increase in the average paid membership. That is, I think, checks a lot of boxes on what has driven Netflix shares up year date.
SEANA SMITH:
Yeah, we know a lot of that focus was on the average revenue per user and how big of a jump we would see given the fact that more people are spending here for the streaming service. Also another thing in this note that's jumping out to me here is what Netflix said-- while we continue to grow our reach, ads plan membership has nearly doubled since the first quarter, but it's off that small membership base. So they do see ad revenue helping Netflix, although saying that won't be material here for Netflix for at least some time.
-
Quick bonus takeaway, this quarter, that big beat on net ads, not good for Disney's streaming ambitions. That's how I read that as well.
SEANA SMITH:
All right. Well, you've heard it here first. All right. Well, let's get over to Josh Schafer with a closer look at how we're trading today and how we've traded over the last couple--
JOSH SCHAFER:
Yeah, I wanted to take a little bit of a historical look there here and get into maybe a little bit of a discussion about a buy the rumor, sell the news that we might be seeing in terms of Netflix because a lot of those headlines you guys were mentioning, I think, overall maybe are good for the long-term investor story in Netflix. What I have right now is the three year you can see how far beaten down Netflix was in 2022. It's been one of those stocks that we've seen rally in 2023.
And I want to just take a little bit of a walk through of what we saw leading up to this earnings call. You remember CEO Reed Hastings out in early January. You saw a big jump there. Then you saw some of the rumors start to come out at the end of March, right? This is that-- the ad tier was going well for Netflix. You saw a big jump back in March on that. Then you fast forward to May and you start hearing more about that password crackdown.
You hear the password crackdown starts going well. You also have that big rally that we've seen overall in tech. Netflix certainly caught up in that. Also, most recently, as we've seen this here, Netflix is considered to be maybe a winner if the Hollywood strike is to continue. Netflix has been picked up here. They have a lot of exposure to broad markets, to European markets, to Asian markets where they create movies, so maybe they'll benefit from an extended Hollywood strike with those actors and writers.
So Netflix has been on quite a run this year, guys. Up almost 62%. And I'm wondering if that's part of the reason maybe you're seeing a little bit of down action today. Certainly some profits to be taken and something that I think we should be watching when we think overall about tech earnings this quarter. A lot of these companies have done very well to start the year. How do investors react to that when you think about maybe even a company like Tesla or some of these other companies that have seen stocks go up over 100% to start the year? How do investors react when they take in these earnings?"
"Netflix, streamers profiting off of 'the old model' amid Hollywood strikes: Sean Gunn",Seana Smith,2023-07-19,20:22:42,"Hollywood actors and writers' unions take to the streets and continue their strikes against studios.

Sean Gunn
joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the profit-sharing goals of
SAG-AFTRA and WGA members
on picket lines, while reacting to Disney CEO Bob Iger's comments calling strike demands ""unrealistic.""
Video transcript
SEANA SMITH:
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 actors, singers, stunt performers, and other media professionals, is on strike after talks with major studios and streamers collapsed. Now, the dispute is with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios like Disney, Netflix, and Amazon. The key issues at stake-- higher pay, residuals, and the use of AI.
We're joined now by one actor who's pushing for big changes in the industry-- Sean Gunn. You may recognize him from his roles on the hit TV show ""Gilmore Girls,"" also from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie franchise. Sean, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us here this afternoon. A major issue--
SEAN GUNN:
Oh, thank you.
SEANA SMITH:
A major issue for you, Sean, with these talks, with the strike that's happening right now is residuals and how little actors are paid, especially when shows are streamed. We're going to hear from Netflix. They're reporting earnings next hour. It's expected to be a very solid report. I'm curious, what's your message to streamers out there given the fact that you're pushing for significant more pay?
SEAN GUNN:
Well, I mean, you know, part of the problem is that we're operating off of the old system. So it used to be very equitable for actors to participate in the profit sharing when there was shows that are in syndication and all these kinds of things. Well, the streamers came along, and they changed the whole model of how business is done. But they continue operating off the old model.
Story continues
So now we don't share at all in the success of the-- of any of the shows that Netflix has. They want to keep their numbers secret and keep them private. And they do that so that they can screw us over and make sure that we don't get to participate when things are going well. And that just absolutely has to change. It's not fair. You know, we should all participate when there's success.
-
Sean, what is a fare structure?
SEAN GUNN:
Well, you know, first of all, I want to be clear that I'm not a member of the negotiating committee. I'm not a member of the SAG board. So I'm only talking on behalf of myself as a SAG member, which I've been for over 25 years.
But, you know, honestly, I'm a big fan of the NBA. And I feel like the NBA has struck a pretty good chord between labor and management because they're transparent. We get to see their numbers. They have-- we know how much profit they're making, and then they split up those profits equitably amongst everybody who's participating.
So yeah, I think a fair deal is percentages. You know, we're not asking for a flat sum. We want a percentage. That's fair because then when they cry, oh, our profits are down, we're not making as much, OK, well, we'll participate in that too. We just want an appropriate portion of the profits that you're making.
SEANA SMITH:
And, Sean, studios have pushed back, saying that the SAG-AFTRA union has dismissed their offers of historic pay, residual increases. We also heard from Disney CEO Bob Iger during an interview last week, and he was calling some of the demands from your side unrealistic. What's your response?
SEAN GUNN:
I think it's a shame-- I'm using Bob's words there. It's a shame that, you know, the WGA put numbers out and found that what they're asking for from Disney-- and I-- again, I'm a SAG member, not a WGA member, but we stand together. I think we're all together on this fight.
But the WGA is asking for from Disney is $75 million a year. That's how much it would cost them if they gave in to every last demand that the WGA has. Well, Bob Iger makes something like $50 million a year. Why is this OK? Why can't we shave some of those earnings off of the top people.
I mean, the problem is that shareholders have decided that if we can squeeze every last dollar we can out of labor, then our profits will go up. But that's not right. It's not ethical. It's not equitable for anybody, and it's not fair.
-
How big of a pay cut, Sean, would you like to see from a Bob Iger. I mean, this guy has made hundreds of millions of dollars for many years over at Disney. I mean, he doesn't appear to be listening to anyone's concerns.
SEAN GUNN:
You know, look, Bob deserves to be rich. He's made his money out there doing his thing. But what he doesn't deserve is to shake his head and say, it's a shame for the people who are down at the bottom of the company that I work for, that, like, it's OK. I'm going to-- I'm going to get a few extra dollars of profit from the laborers. And then we'll fill our own coffers with that.
That's just not fair. I mean, you know, I think that, you know, in 1980, the average CEO in Bob's position made, you know, something like 30 times what the lowest worker for his company made. Now Bob makes 400 times. Like, come on. That's not fair. Let's all participate.
SEANA SMITH:
Sean, the other concern we haven't even talked about yet deals with AI and the impact that that could potentially have on the entertainment industry. What are your biggest concerns when it comes to artificial intelligence and how that can really change the landscape for entertainment?
SEAN GUNN:
Well, let me be clear about one thing, which is that they've asked for-- the AMPTP has asked for the right to scan an actor and own their likeness, own their image in perpetuity. I think anybody-- you don't have to be an industry insider. I think anybody can look at that and say, that's not right. We can't just let people just own our likeness forever. That's absurd. We shouldn't do that.
I do know that AI is-- it's changing. It's changing a little bit every year. And I don't know what the industry is doing on this. But I think that what would be most fair-- because what we're looking for is fairness.
What would be most fair is if we have a, you know, third party take a look every year at AI and say, let's look at how AI is changing the industry and make sure that it's-- make sure we implement that equally so that everybody's participating in its use. It's going to-- it will certainly help some facets of the industry. It'll hurt others. But let's make sure we take a look at this every year and see where it is.

"Netflix subscriber growth surges amid password crackdown, but stock falls on outlook",Alexandra Canal,2023-07-19,20:05:15,"Netflix (
NFLX
) reported second quarter financial results Wednesday that came in mixed as the platform continues efforts to trim costs and boost engagement in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.
Revenue, although 2.7
%
higher compared to the year-ago period, missed estimates despite new initiatives like the
crackdown on password sharing
, which rolled out in the US in late May, along with the recently launched
ad-supported tier
.
The streamer also guided to third quarter revenue of $8.52 billion, below expectations of $8.67 billion.
Shares fell in premarket trading on Thursday as a result, down more than 7%.
Here are Netflix's second quarter results compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg:
Revenue:
$8.19 billion versus $8.30 billion expected
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS):
$3.29 versus $2.90 expected
Subscribers:
5.89 million net additions
versus 2.1 million net additions expected
Despite the revenue miss, profitability metrics like operating margin and free cash flow steadily beat expectations.
Operating margin hit 22.3% in the quarter, surpassing Netflix's own projection of 19%. The company reiterated its full-year operating margin guidance of 18% to 20%.
Free cash flow impressed at $1.34 billion, significantly above consensus calls of $542 million. Netflix boosted its full-year free cash flow guidance to $5 billion, up from the prior $3.5 billion, citing the impact of the double Hollywood strikes.
""We expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of ‘23 as we start to see the full benefits of paid sharing plus continued steady growth in our ad-supported plan,"" Netflix said in the release. ""While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth. We remain focused on: creating a steady drumbeat of must-watch shows and movies; improving monetization; growing the enjoyment of our games; and investing to improve our service for members.""

Just ahead of the results, the company
quietly removed
its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan in the US.
The ""Basic"" plan had been offered to US consumers for $9.99 a month. The removal of this plan, which the company
also did in Canada
last month, comes as Netflix more heavily leans on the ad tier, which comes at a cost of $6.99 per month.
In regards to the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix said it plans to roll out paid sharing to almost all of the remaining countries on Wednesday. Revenue in each region is now higher than pre-launch, the company said, with sign-ups exceeding cancellations.
Netflix attributed the year-over-year decline in average revenue per user to the timing of the paid sharing rollout, which occurred late in the quarter, coupled with limited price increases over the past 12 months and a higher mix of membership growth from lower revenue countries.
Netflix best positioned amid Hollywood strikes

Against the backdrop of earnings, Netflix executives addressed the
double strike
in Hollywood as actors join writers on the picket lines.
Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company is ""super committed"" to reaching a deal with actors and writers in order to end the strikes as quickly as possible.
SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — announced a strike last week after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios.
According to
a new report by Moody's
released on Monday, Netflix is among the best-positioned companies in the event of a prolonged work stoppage, along with Comcast (
CMCSA
), Fox (
FOXA
), Sony Group (
SONY
), Amazon (
AMZN
), and Apple (
AAPL
).
""Major studios, network owners and streamers that are well-diversified by business, content genre (news and sports) or by geographic production and library, and have relatively strong balance sheets are least at risk,"" the report said.
Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter echoed this viewpoint in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Live, emphasizing Netflix's ability to pivot amid the strikes.
""Netflix would love this to drag on for five more years,"" he quipped, adding the studio will ""not be the first"" to cave to demands given its strong presence overseas, breadth of content, and profitable balance sheet.

"Netflix quarterly revenue misses forecasts, shares slide",Lisa Richwine and Dawn Chmielewski,2023-07-19,20:00:58,"By Lisa Richwine and Dawn Chmielewski
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Streaming video pioneer Netflix disappointed Wall Street on Wednesday with second-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst estimates, sending shares tumbling nearly 9% in after-hours trading.
The revenue figure, along with a weaker-than-expected forecast for revenue in the third quarter, overshadowed the addition of 5.9 million new streaming customers from April through June and earnings that easily topped predictions.
Shares of Netflix were down 8.9% after the results at $435.
Netflix has been looking for new ways to make money as streaming competition intensifies and it nears market saturation in the United States. The company launched a cheaper tier with advertising last November, and started asking password borrowers to pay in a widespread crackdown that rolled out in May.
The company said it expected revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, adding it aimed to continue to create compelling shows and movies, improve monetization, boost its video game business and make users' experience better.
""While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth,"" the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders.
The company reported diluted earnings-per-share of $3.29 for the second quarter, ahead of the $2.86 consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
Its nearly 6 million subscriber additions outpaced the 1.9 million that Wall Street expected. Netflix had a total of 238.4 million subscribers worldwide as of the end of June.
Quarterly revenue climbed 2.7% from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, shy of analyst forecasts of $8.3 billion. The company estimated third-quarter revenue would hit $8.5 billion. Wall Street had been forecasting $8.7 billion.
Analyst Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners said some shareholders may have become too bullish about Netflix's advertising tier and the password crackdown.
Story continues
""Some investors’ expectations for (the third quarter) got too far ahead of what is looking like reality in management’s guidance,"" Huber said.
While the company added subscribers, it said average revenue per member fell 3% from a year earlier. That was partly because many of the new sign-ups came in countries where Netflix charges lower prices.
Netflix said its advertising tier remained a small part of its membership base and that current ad revenue is not material.
""We've got a long way to go from where we are today, even getting to 10% (of revenue)"" Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said on a post-earnings interview with an analyst.
Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak attributed some of the share slide after the results to investors selling to take profits. Netflix stock has gained 62% this year, including over 8% this month.
Like its competitors, Netflix is grappling with strikes by tens of thousands of Hollywood actors and writers. The labor action has forced many film and television productions to shut down, though analysts say Netflix has an advantage because of its global production.
Netflix raised its 2023 free cash flow estimate to $5 billion, up from $3.5 billion, in part because it will spend less on content with productions shut down.
Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who noted he grew up in a union household and recalled the hardship of his father going on strike, said he hoped the labor tensions would be resolved soon.
""Let me start by making something absolutely clear: This strike is not an outcome that we wanted,"" Sarandos said.

Netflix scraps cheapest ad-free plan to boost ad-tier,Reuters,2023-07-19,16:27:49,"(Reuters) - Netflix has removed its basic plan in the U.S. and UK in which users could watch shows and movies without commercials, as the company tries to draw more subscribers to its ad-supported tier.
The company said on its website the $9.99-a-month basic plan would no longer be available for new or rejoining members. Users who are already on the plan could continue to remain on it until they change plans or cancel their account.
The streaming video pioneer had launched a $7-per-month option with commercials last November in 12 markets, including the U.S., as an alternative to ad-free plans. It was designed to attract more customers and add a new revenue stream as competition for online viewers intensified.
Netflix had also cracked down on households sharing passwords in May and forced users who share an account outside the same home to pay an additional fee, which in turn triggered droves of users to sign up for its cheaper ad-tier base.
""We expect the most important aspect of Netflix's crackdown on password sharing will be the catalyst it creates to attract more users to its $6.99 ad tier base, in turn generating higher revenue from advertising,"" Macquarie analysts said.
In May, the company said the ad-supported tier had reached nearly 5 million active users per month, in a pitch that emphasized the breadth of its programming to potential advertisers.
The company is scheduled to report its second-quarter results after markets today where investors will assess risks from the ongoing strike in Hollywood.

Hollywood strikes ramp up ahead of Netflix Q2 earnings,Jared Blikre,2023-07-19,16:15:05,"Netflix is set to report its second quarter results after the market close on Wednesday. Streaming companies have been a target of striking writers and actors, who are fighting for new labor agreements. Yahoo Finance Tech Reporter Allie Garfinkle breaks down what the strikes mean for Netflix going forward.
Video transcript
JARED BLIKRE:
Hollywood is still on strike with more actors joining the picket lines day by day. What could this mean for Netflix's much anticipated earnings release after the bell today? We're going to jump coast now to join Yahoo finance's Allie Garfinkle at the picket lines in Los Angeles. Allie, boots on the ground. What are you seeing there?
ALLIE GARFINKLE:
Hi Jared. So it's 9:00 AM here in Los Angeles. And the picket lines are just getting set up right outside Netflix's offices. On one hand, I'd say it's a social environment with some edges. On one hand you have a lot of people drinking coffee, shaking hands, saying hello. And on the other hand, the LAPD is here and the stakes are incredibly high.
Now of course Netflix, in particular, has been a focal point of this strike. Remember, Netflix has come to represent the streaming revolution, the change in the economics of entertainment that so many of these writers and actors are most worried about. And, of course, let's not forget for Netflix itself, the stakes are high. Remember, the company spends about 17 billion annually on content at places like this one, the one I'm standing behind, Sunset Bronson Studios.
And today's Netflix earnings, and I would say that one of the key questions is whether Netflix is set to weather this strike. And ultimately, the answer from a company like Moody's is, yes, Netflix has a couple of key advantages, one of them, of course, is that it has a lot of content investments internationally.
Think about some of Netflix's biggest hits of the last few years, for instance Squid Game shot in South Korea. The other thing too, is because they have that broad catalog that's both domestic and international. They could be set to weather a bunch of different changes. And lastly, of course, they have a profitable balance sheet.
Story continues
So there is a lot of optimism that they are set to weather this strike. However, I would say there is one wrench, Netflix is in the process of changing its business model, right, Jared. There's the ad-supported tier. You've got all sorts of stuff like that, where, for instance, you have the password-sharing crackdown.
So in the end the industry-wide change that could come on the other side of this, strike is actually what I think they should be worried about. But that's down the line, and it's going to be a long hot summer in Los Angeles.
JARED BLIKRE:
Allie, we got another minute here. I know you said it's only 9:00 AM there on the west coast, but have you had the chance to talk to anybody there, and just get a feel for the sentiment and the attitude that pervades right now?
ALLIE GARFINKLE:
So far this morning, it is 9:00 AM. People are just coming by, actually we have people walking by us right now. I would say the sentiment is actually one of optimism. I was just talking to one of the organizers who said-- We are actually really excited. We think we're asking for reasonable things. We think we can get what we want. And we think there is a lot of pressure on these companies.
So I would say the sentiment is one of optimism. But make no mistake about it, I think everyone is really hunkering in for a long haul. The sense I got by the time I got here, Jared, everyone was already set up. This is an incredibly organized endeavor.
JARED BLIKRE:
Long haul. Well you heard it there. Allie Garfinkle, thank you for that report."

The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, or 145 points, and the Nasdaq was up 0.1%.
Goldman Sachs shrugs off earnings miss; Western Alliance lifts sentiment in regional banks
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) reported second-quarter earnings that
missed
Wall Street estimates, weighed down by weakness in its consumer and investment banking businesses. But the stock climbed more than 2% as chief executive David Solomon touted optimism about signs of life in the investment banking business amid a pick-up in deal activity.
“It definitely feels better over the course of the last six-to-eight weeks than it felt earlier in the year,” Solomon said in an earnings call following the bank's quarterly results.
Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) rose more than 1% despite reporting
mixed-quarterly results
as further signs of stability in deposits calm investor jitters about potential outflows from regional banks following the mini banking crisis last summer.
Western Alliance's deposit growth for the quarter came in at $3.5 billion, well ahead of the $2B/quarter guide, which was crucial, UBS said.
Tech takes breather ahead of Tesla, Netflix
Tech was subdued, trading just below flatline, as investors paused their bullish bets on the sector just ahead of the
earnings from Tesla
and Netflix due after the market closes.
Consensus for Tesla's second-quarter results call for revenue of $25B and EPS of $0.81, which ""look beatable,"" Wedbush says, but ""the big focus on this print will be Auto GM (ex credits) to gauge the impact of the price cuts and what this means for margins going forward.""
in Netflix’s quarterly results, meanwhile, subscriber numbers for the quarter as well as guidance will likely dominate investor attention following the streaming giant’s crackdown on password sharing.

Netflix subscribers to pay more for advert-free viewing,Madeleine Ross,2023-07-19,12:22:13,"The Netflix application on a smartphone
Netflix subscribers will have to pay £4 extra a month if they want to watch shows without adverts.
The streaming service has axed its basic subscription, which cost £6.99 a month and allowed viewers to watch shows without adverts in standard definition on one screen, making it a popular option among people who lived alone.
Pricing changes mean new users will now have to pay £10.99 to enjoy commercial-free viewing on Netflix’s “Standard” service, which also allows for multiple screens simultaneously.
A “Premium” subscription is also available for £15.99 and offers Netflix customers the ability to watch shows on four screens at the same time in higher definition.
Fans of popular shows such as Bridgerton and The Witcher who are happy to sit through adverts can pay a reduced rate of £4.99 for Netflix’s “Standard with adverts” deal, although this option does not allow viewers to download shows to watch offline.
Netflix users already on the “Basic” plan can remain on the £6.99 rate until they change their plans or cancel their accounts, the company said.
Nearly 30 million UK households were subscribed to the streaming service as of April.
It announced a crackdown on “password sharing”
– where family and friends use one account to watch shows in multiple households – in 2022.
Customers in the UK now have to pay an extra £4.99 per month on top of their existing subscription to share their account outside their home.
The platform introduced the cheaper advert-based membership in the face of
competition from rivals
such as Amazon Prime and Disney+.
Around 13.2 million households subscribed to at least two streaming services last year, according to figures from regulator Ofcom.
Among
the most popular streaming options
Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, around 5.2 million households were signed up to all three.
Netflix, which began as a DVD postal service, launched its streaming service in 2007.
Its original shows include Orange Is The New Black, as well as films including the Oscar-winning All Quiet On The Western Front.
The streaming giant’s most popular original show is Squid Game, which has been viewed by more than 111 million accounts for a total of more than 1.65 billion hours.
Previously the streaming service had a large library of older content, in recent years the company has focused on achieving success at traditional cinematic awards as the industry rebounds from the pandemic."

Microsoft (
MSFT

Shares in the US tech giant climbed on Tuesday and are expected to extend those gains again today after the company announced an artificial intelligence (AI) subscription option for Microsoft 365 tools.
The “copilot subscription service” adds AI to the company’s Office products including Word, Excel and Teams.
However, it will cost users an additional $30 (£23.16) per month to have the AI offerings, increasing monthly prices for enterprise customers by as much as 83%.
Microsoft made the announcement at its annual partner conference on Tuesday.
It comes as the company’s finance chief, Amy Hood, said recently that next generation AI will be the fastest growing $10bn (£7.86bn) business in our history.
Tesla (

Investors will be keeping across Tesla stock today with the tech giant set to report its second-quarter (Q2) results.
Over the last three months, shares in Elon Musk’s company have jumped 58%, adding over $100 in share price for investors riding the boom.
As a result, Wall Street is expecting Tesla to report revenue of $24.56bn, and adjusted EPS of $0.82.
That revenue figure would represent a slight gain from Q1
, but a massive 45% from a year ago.
On Saturday, the company said it has built its first Cybertruck at the electric-vehicle marker's plant in Texas. It comes four years after Musk first revealed the prototype.
Since then, production timings have faced delays with Musk citing component sourcing challenges.

“While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates,” Zacks Equity Research said.
Zacks also noted that the company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.2%.

Moreover, Zacks said revenues are expected to be $8.26bn, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.

“This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts,” Zacks also noted.

The Netherlands-headquartered semiconductor company ASML reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations and cheered investors on Wednesday with the company’s stock edging higher.

"Goldman Sachs to report, Tesla and Netflix on tap - what's moving markets",Investing.com,2023-07-19,05:44:05,"Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs is on deck to release quarterly earnings that, some analysts fear, could be among the worst in the banking giant's history. Electric carmaker Tesla and streaming group Netflix will also deliver results after the bell. Elsewhere, Microsoft announces the price of its new generative artificial intelligence service in its productivity software.
1. Goldman Sachs to round out bank earnings
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is set to unveil its latest returns on Wednesday, with some investors bracing for the Wall Street powerhouse to potentially report one of its weakest quarters ever.
A slowdown in stock and bond trading, as well as an expected drop in lucrative investment banking fees, are projected to have weighed heavily on Goldman over the last three months.
Recent results from the banking giant's closest rivals point to the impact of the dearth in dealmaking. On Tuesday, Goldman peer Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) second quarter revenue from sales and trading slipped by more than a fifth.
But analysts worry that Goldman faces other issues; namely, an anticipated write-down worth several hundred million dollars from its purchase of home improvement lending group GreenSky, and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios.
Chief executive David Solomon and other members of Goldman's management team have already flagged that this will be a challenging quarter. But just how bad it will be remains uncertain.
2. Tesla and Netflix ahead
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are also among the biggest businesses on tap to report results Wednesday as the parade of second quarter earnings gathers speed.
For Tesla, the focus will likely center around the
EV giant
's gross margin, which analysts expect will slump to a ""trough"" following a series of price cuts aimed at boosting volumes and countering intensifying competition.
Tesla shares, however, have surged over the past three months thanks to solid delivery numbers and charging deals with legacy automakers like GM (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F). The stock has also been swept up in the enthusiasm around companies with exposure to artificial intelligence (AI).
Story continues
Meanwhile, investors are curious to see how Netflix has fared after it launched a drive in May to crack down on password sharing between users. According to data from streaming analytics company Antenna cited by the Wall Street Journal, the number of new sign-ups in the U.S. between May 25 and 28 hit its highest level over a four-day period since Antenna first began compiling the figures. However, cancelations increased in June, per Antenna.
Observers are also keen to see if Netflix has any comments around the ongoing strike by Hollywood's writers and actors. Co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said in May that, even if these labor actions come to pass, Netflix can still rely on a ""robust"" slate of upcoming content.
Both Tesla and Netflix are scheduled to report after the close of U.S. trading.
3. Futures hover near flatline
U.S. stock futures ticked up on Wednesday, but stayed mostly around the flatline, as traders looked ahead to another busy earnings day.
At 05:04 ET (09:04 GMT), the Dow futures contract added 54 points or 0.15%, S&P 500 futures rose by 2 point or 0.05%, and Nasdaq 100 futures increased by 13 points or 0.08%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is coming off its seventh consecutive positive session, while the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also rose. The main indices jumped to their best close since April 2022.
More than 80% of the 38 companies in the S&P 500 that have posted results have delivered earnings beats, CNBC reported, citing FactSet data. Coupled with last week's slower-than-anticipated
inflation
data, the solid earnings could help bolster the case that the U.S. economy may be able to avoid a sharp downturn despite an unprecedented series of interest rate hikes by the
Federal Reserve
.
4. Microsoft closes at record high
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares notched their highest close on record Tuesday after the
software behemoth
announced the pricing of its suite of AI tools.
The Redmond, Washington-based tech group said it would charge $30 per month for access to its generative AI features in its uber-popular productivity services like Microsoft 365.
Analysts projected that the move, which would slap a large premium on top of the average monthly cost paid by Microsoft 365 customers, could lead to a significant boost in revenues. In a note, Wedbush analysts said they were “very bullish for the total addressable cloud AI market opportunity for Microsoft that could increase cloud revenue annually by 20% by 2025[.]""
Chief executive Satya Nadella defended the hefty price tag, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that the new AI features are ""the same class of value"" as its other ubiquitous applications like Word, Excel, and Teams.
5. Oil inches up amid supply constraints, demand worries
Crude prices edged higher Wednesday with traders eyeing supply strains, concerns over U.S. demand, and promises by China's government to take measures to reinvigorate the country's sputtering post-pandemic recovery.
At 05:03 ET, the U.S. crude futures moved up by 0.56% to $76.08 a barrel, while the Brent contract gained 0.72% to $80.20 per barrel.
On the supply side, data from the industry body
American Petroleum Institute
on Tuesday showed that U.S. crude stockpiles fell about 0.8 million barrels last week, after a substantially bigger-than-expected build in the prior week. Government figures from the
Energy Information Administration
are due later in the session.
The Federal Reserve is widely projected to increase borrowing costs by a further 25 basis points this month, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. The decision could weigh on demand in the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, China, the world's second-biggest economy and top oil importer, barely grew in the second quarter. But Beijing has pledged to introduce new policies to ""restore and expand"" consumption in the country, which could give some lift to oil demand.

SEANA SMITH:
It's time now to take a look at what we are watching tomorrow. Investors expecting a slew of big name results starting with Goldman Sachs. The bank set to report earnings before the bell after what has largely been a positive earnings season. So far for the sector, the pressure, though, is on Goldman Sachs' CEO, David Solomon, as the bank is expected to post its worst quarterly earnings results in years tomorrow.
And looking to after the closing bell, investors will get the latest read on Tesla's performance with the EV maker second quarter results. The company coming off a string of good news here for Tesla, including charging deals, strong delivery numbers along with the build of its first cybertruck. The stock has seen gains of over 55% in just the last three months. And the earnings season keeps on rolling on.
Netflix also reporting after the bell with analysts expecting subscription gains from the streaming giant's crackdown on password sharing. Investors will also be closely watching for any insight on the implications from the writers and actors strikes. An oddity tech is expected to go public tomorrow in an IPO market that's showing some signs of life. The beauty and wellness company has yet to price the offering, but it did raise its proposed price range to $32 to $34 a share."
Netflix Target Price Up Ahead of Q2 Earnings: ETFs in Focus,Sweta Killa,2023-07-18,16:05:00,"Netflix NFLX is set to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 19 after market close. Being the world's largest video streaming company, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of the results.
Netflix shares rallied to their highest price in more than a year on Jul 17, after a series of analysts lifted the target price on the stock. The stock has outperformed the broader industry, having gained 39% over the past three months compared with the industry’s average gain of 4.3%. The solid trend might continue, given that Netflix has reasonable chances to beat estimates this quarter. Additionally, Netflix has seen favorable earnings estimate revision activity of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat.
As a result, ETFs with the largest allocation to this streaming giant, like
MicroSectors FANG+ ETN
FNGS,
Invesco Dynamic Media ETF
PBS,
ProShares Nasdaq-100 Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF
QQQA,
First Trust S-Network Streaming & Gaming ETF
BNGE and
Pacer BioThreat Strategy ETF
VIRS, are in focus.
Earnings Whispers
Netflix has an Earnings ESP of +2.11% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
The online video-streaming giant saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock (read: Ride the Streaming Wave With Netflix ETFs).
Though Netflix is expected to record an earnings decline of 11.9%, revenues are likely to increase 3.6% for the to-be-reported quarter. However, the company’s earnings surprise history is not impressive, as it delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.86%, on average, over the past four quarters. Netflix belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (placed at the bottom 18% of 250+ industries).
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average target price is $400.76, with nearly 56% of the analysts giving a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of the company’s earnings.

What’s Hot?
A handful of analysts like Deutsche Bank, UBS, J.P. Morgan, Citi, and Wedbush raised their price targets on Netflix ahead of its earnings. Deutsche Bank projects billions of dollars in fresh revenues, stemming from the streaming service’s high-profile crackdown on password sharing among users. The analyst also sees the ongoing Hollywood strike as a possible justification for further gains.
The company's ad-supported tier is expected to positively impact subscriber and revenue growth. On the last earnings call, the streaming giant expected revenues to grow 3.4% to $8.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.84 for the second quarter.

"Netflix earnings: New ad tier, password crackdown expected to boost revenue",Jared Blikre,2023-07-18,15:59:32,"Netflix will report its Q2 earnings on July 19th. The streamer's new subscription ad tier and password crackdown will be in full focus. Yahoo Finance Media Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down how the new initiatives are expected to impact revenue growth.
Video transcript
JARED BLIKRE:
Result season is in full swing, and Netflix is on deck to report after the bell tomorrow. It's a first major streamer to post numbers, and its ad tier and password sharing crackdown will be watched with laser focus. So what should investors expect? Yahoo finance's Allie Canal joins us now to help break it down. Alexandra, please.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Yes, Jared. And like you were mentioning, all of those revenue initiatives, everything Netflix has been doing is going to boost revenue and earnings in the second quarter. It's expected to be a strong one. Here are the numbers to look out for. Revenue expected to come in at $8.29 billion with adjusted earnings per share of $2.09. Subscriber estimates are for $1.85 million. Although I've seen variations across the street with Wells Fargo anticipating subscriber net adds will be as high as $2.1 million.
Another key number to watch will be average revenue per user. That's expected to see a boost as more subscribers sign up for that ad tier, along with some users utilizing that extra member fee for $8 a pop if you are a part of that password sharing crackdown, which you and I have been a part of that.
JARED BLIKRE:
Yes, I got caught up. And guess what, I re-signed in about two days. They didn't-- it worked. Netflix, you got me.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Exactly, me too. And I think that's fueling a lot of the bullish sentiment that we've seen on Wall Street. Across the board, we have 29 buys, 25 holds, and just 3 sells. The stock is up more than 55% year-to-date. It's one of the top performers in the SMP. And I mentioned that strong third-party data, which we got at the end of this current quarter analytics platform antenna, showing that sign ups in the US for Netflix jumped by the most in at least 4 and 1/2 years after the implementation of that password sharing crackdown. So clearly--
Story continues
JARED BLIKRE:
Too powerful.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
--this is working. It's coming at a really solid time when competition is high. And then you have the overhang of the double strikes happening in Hollywood. But we've been talking to a lot of experts that say Netflix is best positioned to weather that storm due to the amount of content that they have and also their exposure to foreign content and more localized content overseas. So overall, it's going to be a strong report. I'm putting it out there.
JARED BLIKRE:
OK. I'll quote you on that. And actually, we can quote you on that tomorrow afternoon.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
Yes.
JARED BLIKRE:
You're Going to be breaking those numbers live for us.
ALEXANDRA CANAL:
After the bell.
JARED BLIKRE:
All right. Thank you for that, Allie."
"Goldman Sachs, Netflix reports, Tesla earnings: 3 things to watch",Investing.com,2023-07-18,15:56:56,"Investing.com -- Stocks drove higher on Tuesday after mostly positive earnings reports from big banks.
As earnings continue to pour out this week from S&P 500 companies, investors will get to hear from executives about business and consumer spending trends. Retail sales numbers for June showed spending still rising but at a lower-than-expected pace.
The Federal Reserve is getting ready to meet later this month with expectations that it will raise interest rates another quarter of a percentage point as it tries to beat inflation back to its 2% target rate. Consumer prices and producer prices for June showed inflation cooling at a faster-than-expected pace, stoking hopes that the Fed would reach the end of its interest rate increases sooner rather than later.
Tech stocks have gotten a lift in recent days on those hopes. Reports from Netflix and Tesla on Wednesday could add momentum to that trend.
Next week, after the Fed announces its rate decision, investors will get reports on gross domestic product for the second quarter and the personal consumption expenditures index for June.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Goldman Sachs
The investment bank is likely to be affected by the deal slump on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) is expected to report earnings per share of $3.46 on revenue of $10.7 billion.
2. Netflix reports
Streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.84 on revenue of $8.27B.
3. Tesla earnings
Electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is expected to report earnings per share of 79 cents on revenue of $24.3B.

What’s in Store for Netflix Earnings This Week?,Carolane De Palmas,2023-07-18,15:05:12,"Netflix
is among them this Wednesday the 19th, after market close, and analyst expectations are fairly positive after strong share growth this year.
Netflix’s restored momentum in subscriber growth is one of the major causes behind its successful performance lately, employing a twofold strategy to boost growth by enforcing password sharing restrictions and launching a new ad-supported service. These approaches should increase user acquisition and retention, which will grow the customer base further over time.
In the meantime, two major unions, the Writers Guild of America, and now the Screen Actors Guild, and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG- AFTRA), have gone on strike, further crippling an industry still reeling from the aftermath of the Covid pandemic. What effect will this have on the company’s future profitability?
Recap Last Quarter
For the third straight quarter, Netflix’s subscriber growth surged ahead of analysts’ expectations at the start of the year, adding to evidence that the video streaming service has regained its pace following a shocking decline in user demand that spurred an organizational reorganization. The 1.75 million additional Netflix customers added between January and March exceeded most expectations.
Compared to the same period last year, Netflix’s first quarter revenue of $1.3 billion, or $2.88 per share, was down 18%. The per share amount was, however, somewhat higher than expected. Revenue increased 4% from the prior year to $8.16 billion, slightly under analyst expectations.
How Will the Current Strikes Impact the Streaming Giant?
The Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), which is the union representing approximately 160,000 performers, called a strike last week in response to an ongoing labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which includes Netflix. In the background, the Writers Guild of America has been on strike since early May over similar issues.
Story continues
The two main topics that the striking writers and actors are most concerned about are compensation and the development of AI. Actors are becoming increasingly uneasy about the use of AI, which is displacing live performances with computer-generated analogues and taking the place of ‘extras’ among other things. Ultimately, the employment opportunities in the performing industry are threatened by this new direction, which also raises concerns about actors’ future professional prospects.
Some fear the strike could last months and be extremely costly for the industry as actors walk out on commitments from current productions to marketing campaigns and events.
Netflix, with its international productions and new projects already ready to go, is expected to weather the strikes reasonably well, as it has a diverse pull of entertainment at its disposal. For how long this confidence will last is anyone’s guess. If the strike is long enough, the company may struggle along with their competition for a time until new agreements are in place.
Expectations for Q2 2023
It’s anticipated that adding an ad-supported tier will have further propelled membership growth in the second quarter and will be ongoing. Customers who were price-conscious and on the fence about subscribing before are likely to change their minds now after seeing the new option, and revenue from advertisements is also projected to grow.
Netflix
revealed
in May that its ad-supported tier has nearly 5 million global monthly active subscribers already. The company also reported that 25% of new signups in the countries where it is accessible choose the ad tier, and that the number of ad tier customers has more than doubled since the beginning of the year.
Also, as the new crackdown on password sharing quickly reduces unauthorized access, it is expected to have an effect on paid subscriptions too. More than 100 million users, according to the company’s estimation, had previously given their log-in information to friends and family who lived outside of their homes. The company believes around half will opt to open their own accounts over time.
According to Zacks Investment Research, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $2.82, based on the projections of eleven analysts. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $3.20, representing a decrease of 11.88% year-over-year.
Investors expect earnings to grow over the course of the remainder of the year, with the strategies outlined above in addition to cost-cutting measures already
announced
earlier in the year. Netflix shares are currently trading at their highest level since February 2022 at around $456, up more than 54% since January 2023.

Looking at streaming giant Netflix, its fiscal second-quarter earnings are expected to dip -12% YoY at $2.82 per share compared to EPS of $3.20 in Q2 2022. This is despite sales being forecasted to rise 3% from a year ago at $8.26 billion.
Notably, the Zacks ESP also indicates Netflix could beat earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $2.88 per share and 2% above the Zacks Consensus.

P/E Valuation
Monitoring valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings is still important despite the premium many big tech stocks and other industry leaders such as Tesla and Netflix are able to command this year.
Story continues
In regards to a premium, Tesla stock trades at $290 a share and 79.5X forward earnings which is 35% above the Zacks Automotive-Domestic Industry average of 49.6X. Tesla trades beneath its high of 90.6X over the last year but noticeably above the median of 57.3X.
Zacks Investment Research
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pivoting to Netflix stock which trades at $450 a share, its P/E valuation of 39.2X forward earnings is currently below its Broadcasting Radio and Television Industry average of 49.6X. With that being said, Netflix currently trades near its high over the last year of 39.8X and above the median of 28.7X.
Zacks Investment Research
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
At the moment, Tesla and Netflix stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The outlook for these respective industry leaders is still intriguing but after such extensive rallies, there could be better buying opportunities ahead.
Their P/E valuations may be somewhat indicative of such but with Tesla and Netflix expected to beat earnings expectations holding on to their stocks could be rewarding from current levels especially if they can offer favorable guidance.

Hollywood strikes to hit theaters hard as Netflix remains best-positioned: Moody's,Alexandra Canal,2023-07-17,20:09:38,"Hollywood's
double strike
will hit movie theater chains the hardest while streaming-facing companies like Netflix (
NFLX
) are best-positioned in the event of a prolonged work stoppage, according to a new report by Moody's released on Monday.
SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world —
joined writers on the picket lines
early Friday after the guild failed to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Disney (
DIS
), Netflix (
NFLX
), Amazon (
AMZN
), Apple (
AAPL
), and NBCUniversal (
CMCSA
).
The stakes couldn't be higher, Moody's warned, predicting ""a relatively long strike"" which would hit movie theater companies such as AMC Entertainment (
AMC
) and Cineworld (
CINE.L
) first, followed by diversified media companies transitioning to streaming amid secular declines in linear television.
""If there is a protracted strike, cinema operators are most at risk with their nearly complete dependency on new product,"" Moody's said. ""Theatrical exhibitors are already strained from damage caused by the COVID pandemic such as lighter release schedules that followed and shortened distribution windowing. They also have mostly weaker balance sheets and credit ratings.""
Those in the safe zone? Moody's said Netflix, Comcast, Fox (
FOXA
) and Sony Group (
SONY
), along with newer participants like Apple and Amazon, are best-positioned, explaining, ""Major studios, network owners and streamers that are well-diversified by business, content genre (news and sports) or by geographic production and library, and have relatively strong balance sheets are least at risk.""
Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research at Wedbush, echoed Moody's points in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live on Friday, emphasizing Netflix's ability to pivot amid the strikes.
Story continues
""Netflix would love this to drag on for five more years,"" he quipped, adding the studio will ""not be the first"" to cave to demands given its strong presence overseas, broad breadth of content, and profitable balance sheet. Broadcasters and movie studios, on the other hand, are in ""big, big trouble,"" he said.

The media and entertainment industry today is being dramatically reshaped by the impact of streaming services. Streaming shows often have fewer episodes and come with less residual income compared to traditional network television, which often means less money in the pockets of both actors and writers.
At the same time, the majority of studios are no longer just ""pure play"" production houses. Rather, they have their own streaming divisions, which have brought on a new set of challenges as direct-to-consumer losses mount.
""Production in the US has halted at a time when the sector is under pressure to mitigate the secular decline in linear TV and show it can operate streaming platforms at a profit to mitigate linear decay,"" Moody's said. ""Two unions on strike highlights the stresses on both sides of the bargaining table. It is not just the revenue share at stake, but how compensation has evolved in the streaming ecosystem.""
SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment, in addition to higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go direct to streaming. These demands are similar to those posed by the writers' guild.
It is the first time SAG-AFTRA has gone on strike in over four decades and the first time since 1960 that both actors and writers are striking concurrently. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike is currently in its third month with no end in sight.
Actor Kevin Bacon carries a sign on a picket line outside Paramount in Times Square on Monday, July 17, 2023, in New York. The actors strike comes more than two months after screenwriters began striking in their bid to get better pay and working conditions and have clear guidelines around the use of AI in film and television productions. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)
Moody's estimated the newly ratified
Directors Guild of America (DGA) contract,
which included gains in wages and benefits, a 76% increase in foreign streaming residuals (a type of royalty payment), and a ""groundbreaking agreement"" confirming AI is not a person, coupled with potential new WGA and SAG-AFTRA contracts will ultimately cost media companies $450 million to $600 million more per year.
Overall, Moody's said studios, networks and streamers were preparing for potential strikes by increasing production and accelerating deadlines to saturate and lengthen their finished content pipelines.
As a result, the firm believes ""the strike will be a temporary phenomenon and unlikely to cause the investment-grade companies’ credit quality to weaken significantly enough to pressure their ratings in isolation.""
""But it could cause some disruption and ultimately a settlement is highly likely to result in higher costs for all producers and distributors, and potentially for consumers which could moderately hurt subscription growth and churn rates,"" the report added.
The cracks are already beginning to show. CBS said on Monday it plans
to air ""Yellowstone"" reruns
to help fill in the fall TV schedule, which will heavily rely on unscripted reality TV and game shows.

Netflix earnings preview: New subscriber growth will be in focus,Diane King Hall,2023-07-17,15:29:17,"Netflix is set to report its corporate earnings on Wednesday. What are the expectations ahead for the FAANG stock alumnus? Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to explain subscriber growth is the most important figure for the streaming service after its pivot to ad-based subscription tiers and mounting pressures from the Hollywood writers and actors' strikes.
Video transcript

S&P 500 earnings are expected to drop by 7.1% in the second quarter according to FactSet. That would be the sharpest earnings decline since Q2 2020. Can big tech companies be expected to lead in earnings growth this quarter the way that they have dominated the stock market?
We get our first glimpse of tech with two of the magnificent seven reporting on Wednesday, Netflix and Tesla. Joining us now with his earnings outlook is Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager. So Dan, Thank you so much for joining us. First, let's dive right into Netflix, which was also once before, it was in the magnificent seven. It's a thing stock. So what's the expectation for Netflix going into their numbers?
DANIEL MORGAN:
Well, everybody's going to be focusing on the new subscriber data the consensus estimate for the second quarter is about 1.8 billion-- excuse me, 1.8 million new subscribers. And then going into the third quarter, we're looking for about 4.7 million new subscribers.
So those are going to be the key statistics that everybody faces their focus is on. Also, people want to know more color about their basic with ads initiative. We think there's about 2.7 million subscribers that are on this new program that they have. So I think those will be the things that everybody's focusing on. As you guys know, Netflix always trades on new subscriber growth. So that's what | going to be focusing on.
-
It does. The shares, Dan, are already up some 52% or something this year. Do you buy here going into the numbers?
DANIEL MORGAN:
What's interesting because the stock trades about 38 times earnings on a historical price earnings basis. It's traded about 75 times earnings. So from that perspective, it looks very inexpensive. But you have to bear in mind that earnings growth has slowed down dramatically.

Everybody remembers Netflix just spending tons of money on content, didn't care about free cash flow, just drive that subscriber growth. That whole thing has changed. So if you look at consensus estimates going into this year, growth is only 13%. So from a price earnings valuation versus growth, the stock trades slightly above where it should. But it's definitely isn't the growth company that was before that was trading at 75 to 100 times earnings.
-
Is Netflix positioned well amid this writers and actors strike that is now upon us in terms of its content and just going forward?
DANIEL MORGAN:
Well, initially, the thought process was that they were, that they had done a lot of-- conducted a lot of their programming kind of in advance of this and anticipation of it. But as this situation continues to go on, it becomes more challenging, right. Because you start to get through all your shows, and now you've got to start new shows, especially Netflix, who's extremely reliant on programs that go on for a very long period of time through these series. And that's how they hook people, opposed to a movie that could always be delayed. So I think initially, I think they were in pretty good shape. But as long as this continues to go on, it becomes much more challenging for various networks like Netflix that have to constantly come up with extensions on existing series and have writers write that for them.
-
And what are the Netflix margins looking like, not just here but going into the future?
DANIEL MORGAN:
Well, there target margin is about 18% to 20%. That's what they're kind of targeting going forward. So obviously, as they start to become more focused on free cash flow. For example, in this upcoming year, they're expected to do about $3.9 billion in free cash flow. Their streaming obligation, contractual streaming obligations, about $22.9 billion.
So they're definitely slowing down in terms of the amount of money that they're spending. And they're being more cognizant to margins free cash flow and not increasing debt so much. So as they continue to move forward, I think that you'll see Netflix become more of a margin expansion story as opposed to a growth at all cost story."

, Bank of America
(BAC)
, and Morgan Stanley
(MS)
, are just some of the companies set to release earnings this week. In addition to earnings, economic data such as retail sales, jobless claims, and existing home sales will also be released. Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down what to watch.
Video transcript
-
Well, from data to earnings, there's a lot on the docket this week. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer joins us now to break it down. And I know how excited you get about the calendar. So this is a good week for you.
JOSH SCHAFER:
It is a good week for me. Now, I started with the boring calendar, though. This isn't the most exciting one. We'll get this out of the way, we'll say, right. This is the economic data to watch this week, and it is not that full of an economic week. But two big things I'm watching here. We have retail sales tomorrow, expected to increase 0.5% from last month.
And I think that's interesting just as far as we've been watching for resilience, right. Resilience in the economy. Are things continuing to improve? Are consumers continuing to spend? Another positive retail sales print would certainly feed that narrative we've been talking about in the economy.
And then in a light week, another thing I like to always highlight is jobless claims. We've been talking a lot about the strong labor market. Jobless claims broadly for several months now, really dating back to the spring, have been in a range of about 235,000 to about 265,000. Economists are looking for that number two pick up significantly if we're going to see any signs of softening in that labor market.
But Julie, what I'm excited about is the earnings calendar. Let's take a look at the earnings calendar for this week. It's our first big week of earnings. So on Tuesday, we got Bank of America and Charles Schwab. Morgan Stanley highlighting more financials there. We also have Goldman Sachs coming this week as well.
Story continues
We know in financials, it's is going to be interesting to see from Goldman and Morgan Stanley specifically how their investment banking is doing. That was something that was highlighted last Friday when you take a look at Wells Fargo and JP Morgan doing well. Citi maybe not doing as well in that area. And I think that's something to sort of watch in financials.
But the other interesting theme, broadly, I think when we take a look at this list, Wednesday, you have Tesla and Netflix. And really, what I'm curious to see there is how these stocks trade and how volatile they are in the day after earnings. Netflix up over 50% this year. Tesla up about 130% on the year.
Are people going to say, maybe these earnings were decent, but I want to get rid of and do a little bit of take some gains at this point in the year? I think is going to be interesting to watch. Tesla, those margins, is going to be the key thing to look at. And then I added a special one for us now that we're in earnings season, guys.
So to close out, we've got how companies are doing. So so far, this is the S&P 500 companies in the S&P 500. 80% of the companies that have reported have beat EPS estimates. Now, if you follow this closely, you'd know not a lot of companies have reported this.
-
That was Iwas going to say. Not that many.
JOSH SCHAFER:
I don't know how much we want to look into that number. But this week, as we just highlighted, we have 60 companies from the S&P 500 expected to report this week according to FactSet. So we will get a lot of data on how companies are doing, specifically in that financial sector. And then we'll be able to pull a little bit more from that. And maybe this number will move next week. And I think we'll be able to glean a little bit more from it then.
-
I have a special request. Can we add percentage of companies beating sales estimates as well?
JOSH SCHAFER:
We can.
-
Did you see Josh's face? His eyebrows raised, like I can only say yes.
JOSH SCHAFER:
We have the data. We'll bring it next week.
-
Let's do it.
-
All right.
-
All right. Josh Schafer. Thank you. More homework for you."
"Q2 Earnings Week Brings Us Tesla, Netflix & More",Mark Vickery,2023-07-17,13:58:00,"Still early-on in Q2 earnings season, this week we get a look at the first of the FAANG stocks (if we’re still calling them that).
Netflix
NFLX reports Wednesday after the closing bell, and is expected to bring in earnings -11.88% from the same quarter a year ago, on +3.63% higher revenues. The streaming entertainment giant is looking for its seventh earnings beat in the last eight quarters. The stock remains well off its late-2021 high, but up from the trough of mid-2022. That said, Netflix is also trading up 40%+ year to date.
For Netflix, one of the biggest emerging concerns may not show up in the Q2 numbers: the ongoing writers strike, joined now by SAG-AFTRA actors on the picket line. Without new content being produced, streaming content will likely see some headwinds in new subscriber numbers, especially as competition increases from other services. We’re more likely to get insights on Netflix’s conference call after the initial press release on Q2 numbers is out.
Tesla
TSLA also reports Wednesday afternoon, although its numbers are expected to far outshine the year ago quarter: +9.2% on earnings and a whopping +47% on the top-line. Strong auto delivery guidance has helped buoy the stock over the past couple months, and year-to-date Tesla is +160% from the near-term trough at the start of 2023. The electric vehicle leader is looking for its 10th straight earnings beat. Both Tesla and Netflix currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Ahead of today’s open, the July Empire State Manufacturing Index has notched its second-straight month in positive territory, with headline +1.1 a light improvement over the 0.0 expected, and down from the surprise 6.6 (unrevised) posted for June. This is only the fourth month in the last 12 where manufacturing in New York State has been in the green; August of 2022, January 2023 and May of 2023 came in -31.3, -32.9 and -31.8, respectively.
Back to Q2 earnings a moment, tomorrow is when the action really begins, with more Wall Street banks and investment firms — Bank of America BAC, Morgan Stanley MS, Bank of New York - Mellon BK, PNC Financial PNC and Charles Schwab SCHW all put out numbers ahead of the bell. In addition, Lockheed Martin LMT, Hasbro HAS and Novartis NVS widen the scope of industries ready to report. Of these, only Lockheed currently registers a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy); the others are all #3s.

Why Earnings Season Could Be Great for Netflix (NFLX),Zacks Equity Research,2023-07-17,12:42:00,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and
Netflix, Inc.
NFLX, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.
That is because Netflix is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NFLX in this report.
In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.88 per share for NFLX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.82 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NFLX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.11%  heading into earnings season.

Why is this Important?
A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).
Given that NFLX has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.

"Netflix shielded from Hollywood strike by global crew, strong pipeline",Samrhitha A,2023-07-17,10:10:34,"By Samrhitha A
(Reuters) - Netflix investors will assess risks from the ongoing strike in Hollywood when the company reports quarterly results on Wednesday, but analysts said it was well positioned due to its solid pipeline of shows and international production crew.
Striking Hollywood actors have joined film and television writers on picket lines, forcing U.S. studios to shutter productions as workers battle over pay in the streaming TV era.
Some of the people on strike are also picketing the Netflix offices in Los Angeles.
But the streaming giant, which is set to report its highest second-quarter subscriber additions since 2020, is likely to keep churning out titles such as Gal Gadot's upcoming ""Heart of Stone"" and ""Too Hot to Handle, Season 5"".
Netflix's international production capabilities are a ""huge differentiator"", and a lot of their content comes from countries that are not involved in the strike, analysts at SVB MoffettNathanson, Credit Suisse and Insider Intelligence said.
The company demonstrated that capability during the pandemic, when subscribers flocked to shows created outside the United States, including the French mystery thriller ""Lupin"" and the comedy ""Call My Agent!"", SVB MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.
Netflix is also not tethered to the parts of the entertainment business that are struggling, namely theatrical and broadcast television, Nathanson added.
In the past week, three brokerages have raised their ratings on Netflix's stock, while five have lifted their price targets.
Netflix's crackdown on password sharing is also reaping returns, and its cheaper, ad-supported plan is finding more takers, as the company copes with competition from Disney+ and Amazon's Prime Video.
The move, that forces users who share an account outside the same home to pay an additional fee, drove the four biggest days of user additions in the U.S. in at least four-and-a-half years, data from research firm Antenna shows.
Story continues
""Our experts estimate that of the 100 million households reportedly sharing passwords, Netflix could drive around 50% to ultimately create their own accounts,"" Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley said.
Netflix is expected to have added a net 1.77 million subscribers, according to Refinitiv, in what is typically a weak quarter due to school holidays. The company lost nearly 1 million subscribers in the year-ago period.
It has also been two full quarters since Netflix launched its ad-supported tier, which likely pulled in 2.7 million subscribers in the April-June period, according to research firm Visible Alpha.
""We expect the most important aspect of Netflix's crackdown on password sharing will be the catalyst it creates to attract more users to its $6.99 ad tier base, in turn generating higher revenue from advertising,"" Macquarie analysts said.
Ad-supported revenue likely came in at $169.3 million in the second quarter. Insider Intelligence predicts Netflix could generate $770 million in ad revenue by the end of 2023.
The second quarter also featured some strong programming from Netflix, including hits like ""Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story"" and ""Never Have I Ever Season 4"".

Tesla (
TSLA
)
Investors will be keeping an eye on Tesla stock on Monday with the tech giant set to report its second quarter (Q2) results on Wednesday.
On Saturday, the company said it has built its first Cybertruck at its electric vehicle (EV) plant in Texas. It comes four years after Tesla founder Elon Musk first revealed the prototype.
Since then, production timings have faced delays with Musk citing component shortage and sourcing challenges.
​​In a shareholder meeting, Musk said that Tesla would like to produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year, depending on demand.

Reuters previously reported that Tesla aims to start mass production of the Cybertruck at the end of this year.
The Cybertruck launch gives Tesla an EV entrant in one of the most profitable segments of the US market.
It will compete with electric trucks from Ford (
F
) and Rivian (

).
Entain (
ENT.L
)
Shares in Entain fell nearly 1% on Monday after the company announced it is buying Angstrom Sports, a provider of sports modelling, in a deal worth around £200m ($261.8m).
Entain said the acquisition secures it as the only global operator with a full in-house suite of end-to-end analytics, risk and pricing capabilities for US sports betting products.
The company also said the enriched in-house capabilities will provide a significantly greater number of betting opportunities, optimised parlay and in-play products as well as accelerating pricing expertise and risk management, delivering margin enhancement over the long term.
The acquisition is expected to complete during Q3 2023.
Jette Nygaard-Andersen, chief executive of Entain, said: “We are delighted that Angstrom will be joining Entain, enabling us to accelerate the development of the Entain Platform. Their next generation forecasting, pricing and risk management capabilities will unlock significant opportunities across BetMGM’s US sports betting offering, particularly in the fast-growing markets of parlay and in-play wagering.”

Sion Colley, chief executive of Angstrom Sports, said: “Entain shares Angstrom’s passion for innovation and our partnership will enable us to realise our ambitions in bringing best in class products and experiences to sports betting customers through Entain’s market leading global brands.”
Netflix (
NFLX
)
US video streaming firm Netflix will also release its Q2 earnings this week with the company expected to report a record number of users following the purge on password sharing.
However,
Wall Street is expecting a year-over-year decline in earnings
on higher revenues for the quarter ended June 2023.
“While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates,” Zacks Equity Research said.
Zacks also noted that the company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.2%.

Moreover, Zacks said revenues are expected to be $8.26bn, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Meanwhile, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.
“This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts,” Zacks said.
DFS Furniture (
DFS.L
)
Shares in DFS rose nearly 1% on Monday after the company said it was on track to achieve profits of just over £30m for the full-year 2023.
The group also said it expects to achieve profit growth next year and is confident in its long-term targets of £1.4bn of revenue and 8% profit before tax.
However, the furniture company highlighted that it is uncertain about the broader market environment, with market volumes down 15-20% this year as consumer demand being impacted by the macroeconomic environment.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: “DFS shares fared extremely well during the
pandemic
, thanks to the stay-at-home boom in DIY and home improvements when many consumers enjoyed extra disposable income when travel, restaurants and high street shops were out of reach.
“However, since the highs in 2021, shares have been under pressure as the
cost of living crisis
weighs on consumers’ propensity to spend. DFS however remains optimistic, focusing on cutting costs to preserve margins in an attempt to counteract the challenging market backdrop.”
DFS stock is down around 28% year-to-date, sharply underperforming the wider UK market, according to Scholar.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.
Factors to Consider
Netflix’s second-quarter 2023 results are expected to reflect the impact of paid sharing launch in the United States. The company launched its paid-sharing model in the United States on May 23, notifying members that their accounts cannot be shared for free with users outside their residences.
Moreover, ad-supported low-priced plans are expected to have a modest incremental benefit toward top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s sprawling games portfolio is also expected to have provided a boost to user engagement in the to-be-reported quarter.
Netflix, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to have benefited from its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content.

Nevertheless, Netflix’s strong content portfolio is expected to have helped keep the subscriber base intact in the second quarter of 2023.
The company’s shares have gained 52.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s growth of 31.9%. It has also outperformed Apple, Comcast and Disney.

Netflix becoming streamer that 'Disney+ would like to be': Analyst,Brad Smith,2023-07-14,15:30:43,"Netflix's crackdowns on password sharing and pivot towards ad-supported tiers are proving to be revenue drivers for the streaming company. Michael Pachter, Wedbush Managing Director, Equity Research, details Netflix's strategy to maximize average revenue per user — or ARPU — and how it has transformed from a ""zero profit, money-losing fast growth company"" into a ""slow-growth, extremely profitable"" company as pressure from competitors has continued to ramp up.
Video transcript
-
We've got one more topic to touch on here-- as you were mentioning, Netflix. Of course, Netflix does kick off earnings for the streamers on Wednesday. The company's revenue is expected to grow over 3% year-over-year in its second quarter. All eyes are going to be on the impact of the streaming giant's password crackdown and ad tier.
We're bringing back in Michael Pachter, Wedbush managing director of equity research here. Michael, just run us through some of your expectations. Does Netflix-- did they impress this quarter from your estimation?
MICHAEL PACHTER:
I expect the Phillies to compete pretty favorably for a World Series title. So you won't be completely disappointed.
You know, Netflix guidance was pretty wimpy-- 2 million subscribers and kind of a modest revenue guide. And it incorporated a couple of changes they made. They introduced an ad-supported tier a quarter ago, more than a quarter ago. And they started cracking down on password sharing.
And none of us really know what the metrics are for either one of those things. We're seeing good third party data, primarily from Canada, where they've accelerated this stuff, showing that the ad-supported tier is working and that fewer people are quitting. And when they do sign up, they're signing up for more expensive plans.
The password sharing is really interesting because they're giving us an opportunity to buy a second and third subscription instead of just terminating whoever's sharing our password. And they're doing it at a discount. So it's actually pretty cheap.
Story continues
I have two daughters who just graduated from college. both moved back home. But when they move out, I'm going to buy them each a $7.99 subscription.
And I'm not sure how that plays on the published metrics. Is it two more subscribers or higher RPU for my household? I suspect the latter. But I think you're going to get a good report next week. I think you're going to see RPU tick up.
And I'm not talking $5. I'm talking $0.10 or $0.20. But it'll be a trend. And I think if they don't miss on subscribers, they won't. And if RPU goes up, it will.
That stock's going to scream higher because what they've done is successfully transform themselves from a zero-profit, money-losing, fast-growth company that people paid for growth into a slow-growth, extremely profitable company. They are the guys that Disney+ would like to be. Disney+ just hasn't figured out how to do it yet.

Michael, all of that said, this is a stock that's up 51% year-to-date and is trading at, what, something like 39 times forward earnings, so. I mean, does it not only have to beat, it has to really beat when it comes to these numbers?
MICHAEL PACHTER:
If you think that the average subscriber in the West is paying $180 a year and the average subscriber globally is paying over $100, it's not that hard for them to add 10 million subs and add $1 billion in revenue. Their incremental cost is the technology cost to deliver the stream. That's it. So maybe 20% of that.
So I think you could see these guys grow earnings by $2 to $3 a year in perpetuity. So if you go from $12 to $15 to $18 to $21, it's really not an expensive stock at all.
Remember, I had to sell on this thing from $3 to $690. And then it started to go down. And I got lucky with my upgrade to buy at $193. So yeah, I know exactly how much it's moved. But realistically, I think if they do what they're supposed to do, which is make money, it's going back to $600, $690.

All right, we'll see. We'll see how much money exactly they're going to be making. Michael Pachter, good to get your perspective, Wedbush managing director of equity research. Appreciate it."
"Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks Equity Research,2023-07-14,13:00:10,"Netflix
(NFLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this internet video service have returned +1.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share, indicating a change of -12.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $11.26 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.2%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.
Story continues
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.73 indicates a change of +30.9% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Netflix, the consensus sales estimate of $8.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.6%. The $33.91 billion and $38.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.3% and +13%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Netflix reported revenues of $8.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $2.88 for the same period compares with $3.53 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.25%. The EPS surprise was +1.77%.
Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Netflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Netflix (NFLX) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know,Zacks Equity Research,2023-07-12,21:45:25,"In the latest trading session, Netflix (NFLX) closed at $443.86, marking a +0.83% move from the previous day.

Netflix (NFLX) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks Equity Research,2023-07-12,14:00:38,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Netflix (NFLX) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This internet video service is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.2%.
Revenues are expected to be $8.26 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Story continues
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Netflix?
For Netflix, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.89%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination indicates that Netflix will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Netflix would post earnings of $2.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.88, delivering a surprise of +1.77%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Netflix appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Netflix 'has the strength' to gain ad market share: MNTN CEO,Brad Smith,2023-07-11,15:56:19,"Investors were initially skeptical of Netflix's new ad tier, but early data suggests customers haven't been put off by it. MNTN CEO Mark Douglas tells Yahoo Finance Live why Netflix may succeed with an ad tier, but other streamers may not.
Video transcript
-
When it comes to Netflix, if we can switch gears to Netflix, when the streamer rolled out, its new tier-based pricing system investors were skeptical about the positive impact that it could have on the company. New data from antenna suggests that consumers have not been put off by advertisements. Daily sign-ups to the streaming company have reached an average of 73,000, while cancellations also saw an increase by 25%. So what can investors take away from this? Will other streaming platforms adopt more tiered pricing systems and include more advertisements?
Mountain CEO, Mark Douglas, is back to discuss more here. So what do you think is the kind of net out of this? And the tiered pricing strategy that has moved forward, is it a zero sum game or is it kind of a rising tide type of game?
MARK DOUGLAS:
No, it's a zero-sum game. So the brand advertising business, we're talking brand television advertising, in the US that's about a $70 billion market. Worldwide, I think it's something like in the $160 billion range. It's a zero-sum game, it is not growing. Growth rates for these big brand advertisers literally are about 1% annually. So for Netflix to gain market share or anyone else to gain market share, someone has to lose. It has to come from another broadcaster.
And so the Netflix has the strength, meaning that they have the user base for it, they have the shows for it, the kind of big shows that these big brand advertisers want. But anyone else who wants to jump in that game, it's a struggle. They have to-- I mean, the list of networks out there, they just have to. Their money has to come from someone else, so it's a fight.
So I think only Netflix can really win that fight. Disney obviously, also in that realm. But anyone else is going to struggle to gain the kind of traction that those guys can coming into ad-supported streaming model.

-
Again, looking at it from the advertisers perspective, Mark, what do they want? Is it just a matter of size? Do they want the most eyeballs? Is it a matter of the best data? Whatever the best data means right now. What do they want?
MARK DOUGLAS:
Yeah, so in the television realm, you have to think of it as two markets. So one market, the buyers want ads, and they want those ads on the best shows. They're just trying to build affinity for their brand, continue to expand the reach of their brand. And so that's what they're looking for, and that's why you have things like upfronts and you spend $1 million filming a commercial, a lot of things that don't makes sense. You don't need an upfront for the advertiser on Instagram, you don't need to spend $1 million on an ad.
So those advertisers, they're looking for something that's unique, and they want it on the top networks on the top shows. The rest of the market, which is actually three times the size, just wants eyeballs. They want people to come to their brand, and that's why Google AdWords is so big, that's why Meta is big, and that's what Mountain does in terms of performance advertising on TV.
So again, someone like Netflix, they're initially appealing to those big brand advertisers. To keep growing that over time, they're going to have to start to also compete with Google and Meta, because that's where that market, which is performance, advertising, direct response is three times larger. But it all starts with upfronts. It's just so kind of attractive to them that they can-- in one week a year, they can pull down $1 billion of revenue and then upfront, it's really hard for them to walk away from that. And that's where they all start when they enter the brand ad with the big TV markets.

Makes sense, Mark. Good to see you, Mark. Mountain CEO, Mark Douglas, appreciate it."
