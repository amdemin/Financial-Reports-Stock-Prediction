       "[('COMBINED-Q4-17-Shareholder-Letter-FINAL',\n",
       "  \"We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than doubled global operating income. . Q4 Results Average paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in ASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5% margin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating margin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year. EPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items that affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which partially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform. In Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last year’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet entertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based. In the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3 million. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although contribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the marketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter. Internationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record for quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue and ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments in a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017 (4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution profit in our history. We took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected expense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger than expected member growth and the timing of international content spend. Forecast The guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net adds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally. As we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year 2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year. We believe our big investments in content are paying off. In 2017, average streaming hours per membership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more revenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018. 2Big hits like 13 Reasons Why, Stranger Things and Bright result from a combination of great content and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b great marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about $1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content, and we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll grow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018. Content Q4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of The Crown and Black \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Mirror as well as Stranger Things, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon. In the quarter, we \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b also successfully launched new titles like the limited series Godless, Marvel’s The Punisher and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Mindhunter (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s \\u200b amazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had three of the Top \\u200b 5 most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row. \\u200b Our largest investment in original films to date, Bright, a fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a \\u200b \\u200b major success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, Bright has become one of our \\u200b \\u200b most viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well as additional investment in original films. We’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of Club de \\u200b Cuervos as well as The Day I Met El Chapo, both of which are from Mexico; Suburra from Italy; and an \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b unscripted series from the UK, Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father. We also debuted Dark, our first \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b German original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for instance, Dark, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions \\u200b \\u200b of members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with attractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this initiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland, India, Korea and Japan. We are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall deals with Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy and Orange is the New Black and GLOW creator Jenji \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Kohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over the world. Product and Partnerships We are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our mutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix, while our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of these types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche Telekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC removed the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net 3neutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the FCC’s action. Competition We have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend becomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On the commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with Apple Music or with iOS. Facebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their multi-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for entertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix. Traditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring most of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand and great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower end of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of content payments, which will now occur in 2018. Our operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is content. When we develop a title like Bright, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated \\u200b \\u200b membership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for self-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend will turn our business FCF positive. In the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re growing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had planned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018. Given our track record of content investments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the increased investments we are making in original content this year. We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of interest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to grow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt. High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick. 4Board of Directors We are pleased to add Rodolphe Belmer to our board of directors. Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+ \\u200b \\u200b Group in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing percentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our board. Summary Our goal is to entertain people. We are thrilled to be able to do that at great scale.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our investments in marketing, technology and 5development, and content, including original content; content and product partnerships; impact of U.S. net neutrality rules; growth of internet video and competitive landscape; future capital raises; expectations of positive free cash flow, impact of the new limitation on the deductibility of interest; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

       "  'In our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end. What’s clear is the escalating human cost in terms of lost lives and lost jobs, with tens of millions of people now out of work. At Netflix, we’re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term. Like other home entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth. In our case, this is offset by a sharply stronger US dollar, depressing our international revenue, resulting in revenue-as-forecast. We expect viewing to decline and membership \\u200b growth to decelerate as home confinement ends, which we hope is soon. By helping people connect with stories they love, we are able to provide comfort and escape as well as a sense of community during this pandemic. So our focus has been on maintaining the quality of our service while our employees around the world adapt to working from home. For the most part, this has gone smoothly. Our product teams, for example, have been relatively unaffected. As a precaution, we have temporarily reduced the number of product innovations we try, while continuing to release features that we know will add meaningful value for our members, such as improved parental controls. However, we have seen significant disruption when it comes to customer support and content production. On the customer support side, we’ve now fixed most of our work-from-home challenges. In addition, we’ve taken on another 2,000 agents (all working remotely), so our customer service levels are almost fully restored despite the increased demand. When it comes to production, almost all filming has now been stopped globally, with the exception of a few countries like Korea and Iceland. This has been devastating for millions of workers in the TV and film industry - electricians, hair and make-up artists, carpenters and drivers who are often paid hourly wages and work project-to-project. In March, we created a $100 million fund to help with hardship in the industry, starting with the hardest \\u200b \\u200b hit workers on our productions, where Netflix has the greatest responsibility. We will have paid these crews for about seven weeks, with the goal of providing a bridge until government safety nets kick in. In addition, we’re donating $30 million to third parties and non-profits, providing emergency relief to out-of-work crew and cast across the broader TV and film industry in countries where we have a large production base. This includes donations of $1 million each to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation COVID-19 Disaster Fund, the \\u200b \\u200b Motion Picture and Television Fund and the Actors Fund Emergency Assistance in the US, and $1 million \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b between the AFC and Fondation des Artistes in Canada. These are all well established hardship funds. In \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 1other countries where no such funds exist, we’ve been working to set them up, including in the UK (£1 million) with the British Film Institute, in Italy ( 1 million) with the Italian Film Commission, in France ( 1 \\u200b \\u200b € \\u200b \\u200b € million) with Audiens, in Brazil (R$5 million) with the Brazilian Institute of Audiovisual Content, in Mexico \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b ($1 million) with the Mexican Academy of Film Arts and Sciences, in Spain (€1 million) with the Ministry \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b of Culture and Sport, Accion Cultural and the Film Academy and in the Netherlands (€1 million) with the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Netherlands Film Fund. \\u200b In total, we have committed to spend $150 million supporting the industry through this crisis. Netflix’s culture is designed to empower decision making at all levels of the company. Throughout this crisis, our employees have been working tirelessly to maintain the quality of our service and to find quick, practical solutions to the problems Netflix and our partners face. For example, within two weeks of the shelter-in-place orders coming into effect in Los Angeles, most of our animation production team was back up and running, working from home. On the post production side, we’ve been able to get 200+ projects going remotely. Most of our series writers’ rooms are operating virtually. However, we’ve been unable to create dubs in Italian and some other languages due to home confinement of our voice talent for a handful of titles launching in April and May. But we hope that with the help of guilds around the world, voice actors can be set up from home, ensuring that they can stay safe and continue to earn a living. Similar efforts are underway for both music and visual effects. This pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a strong Internet like never before. Over the years, we’ve invested heavily in Open Connect, a pioneering caching system that puts our library of content as close to members’ homes as possible. This enables ISPs to run their networks more efficiently and at a lower cost. However, given the surge in internet use, networks in some countries have struggled to cope. In March, we were asked by a number of governments and ISPs to temporarily reduce the network traffic of our members. Using our Open Connect technology, our engineering team was able to respond immediately, reducing network use by 25 percent virtually overnight in those countries, while also \\u200b \\u200b substantially maintaining the quality of our service, including in higher definition. We’re now working with ISPs to help increase capacity so that we can lift these limitations as conditions improve. Netflix employees have been outstanding and to help them support their local communities, we’ve doubled our charitable match giving program for 2020. So for every $1 donated by our employees to an organization, we now donate an additional $2 to that organization. Last, and most important of all, we want to say thank you on behalf of all our employees to the heroic doctors, nurses and first responders fighting this pandemic on the frontlines and the grocery, restaurant and other essential workers who take risks to make sure our families are fed and taken care of. We are truly inspired and humbled by you. Our summary results for Q1 and our Q2 forecast can be found in the table below. 2Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Despite paid net additions that were higher than forecast, revenue was in-line with our guidance due to the appreciation in the US dollar vs. other currencies. Excluding a -$115m impact from F/X, streaming ARPU grew 8% year over year. Operating margin of 16.6% (vs. 10.2% in the prior year quarter) was lower than our 18.0% forecast as we incurred $218m in incremental content costs due to paused productions and hardship fund commitments (a 3.8 percentage point impact to operating margin). There are three primary effects on our financial performance from the crisis. First, our membership growth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement. Second, our international revenue will be less than previously forecast due to the dollar rising sharply. Third, due to the production shutdown, some cash spending on content will be delayed, improving our free cash flow, and some title releases will be delayed, typically by a quarter. More on each of these three effects below. During the first two months of Q1, our membership growth was similar to the prior two years, including in UCAN. Then, with lockdown orders in many countries starting in March, many more households joined Netflix to enjoy entertainment. This timing of paid membership additions also affected our Q1’20 global streaming ARPU; this was the primary driver of the sequential decline in streaming ARPU as the revenue impact from these additions late in the quarter will be mostly felt in Q2’20 and beyond. Hopefully, progress against the virus will allow governments to lift the home confinement soon. As that happens, we expect viewing and growth to decline. Our internal forecast and guidance is for 7.5 million global paid net additions in Q2. Given the uncertainty on home confinement timing, this is mostly guesswork. The actual Q2 numbers could end up well below or well above that, depending on many 3factors including when people can go back to their social lives in various countries and how much people take a break from television after the lockdown. Some of the lockdown growth will turn out to be pull-forward from the multi-year organic growth trend, resulting in slower growth after the lockdown is lifted country-by-country. Intuitively, the person who didn’t join Netflix during the entire confinement is not likely to join soon after the confinement. Plus, last year we had new seasons of Money Heist and \\u200b \\u200b Stranger Things in Q3, which were not planned for this year’s Q3. Therefore, we currently guess that \\u200b Q3’20 and Q4’20 will have lower net additions than last year due to these effects. Second, partially due to the crisis, the US dollar has appreciated significantly, which creates a drag on international revenue growth. As an example, the price for our standard plan in Brazil is R$33, which used to be $8.5 last year but now is $6.5 based on April 2020 F/X rates, so we have a ~25% decline in US dollar average subscription price from Brazil, which offsets strong membership growth. Third, we’ve paused most of our productions across the world in response to government lockdowns and guidance from local public health officials. In Q2, there is only a modest impact on our new releases, which is primarily language dubbing. No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages, and post-production) will play out. The impact on us is less cash spending this year as some content projects are pushed out. We are working hard to complete the content we know our members want and we’re complementing this effort with additional licensed films and series. Our content competitors and suppliers will be impacted about as much as we are, in terms of new titles. Since we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our member satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers’ by a shortage of new content, but it will take time to tell. We continue to target a 16% operating margin for the full year 2020, despite the extra costs in Q1. As a reminder, more than half of our revenue is not denominated in US dollars and we don’t hedge our foreign exchange exposure. If the US dollar remains at these elevated levels (or strengthens further), we may target modestly slower growth in our annual operating margin progression next year. Given that lead time, we believe we can readjust our model to be appropriate in that new stronger US dollar world. Content As people shelter at home, our hope is that we can help make that experience more bearable by providing a diverse range of high quality content for our members. While our productions are largely paused around the world, we benefit from a large pipeline of content that was either complete and ready for launch or in post-production when filming stopped. For Q2, we’re looking forward to releasing all of our originally planned shows and films (with some language dubbing impacts on a few titles). We’re also finding ways to bolster our programming this year - including the recent acquisition of Paramount’s and Media Rights Capital’s The Lovebirds, a comedy \\u200b \\u200b starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, for Q2’20 and Legendary Pictures’ Enola Holmes starring Millie \\u200b \\u200b Bobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin, for Q3 ‘20. So, while we’re certainly 4impacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety of new titles throughout 2020 and 2021. Our Q1 slate highlighted the variety of content that people enjoy en masse all over the world on Netflix: scripted English language series like Ozark season 3 (a projected 29m member households will have \\u200b \\u200b chosen to watch this season in its first four weeks), the riveting docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem \\u200b and Madness (64m), our breakthrough unscripted dating show Love is Blind (30m), original film Spenser \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Confidential (85m), and season four of the Spanish language hit La Casa de Papel, aka Money Heist (a \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b projected 65m), which debuted in early April. In Q2, we are looking forward to the launch of Space Force, our new original comedy series created by \\u200b \\u200b Greg Daniels (The Office) and Steve Carell, starring Carell, John Malkovich and Lisa Kudrow.

In each of these countries, there are now three daily lists: Top 10 overall, Top 10 series and Top 10 films. Our goal with this feature is to help members find great TV shows and films and enable them to be part of the cultural zeitgeist in their country. Recently, we’ve also enhanced our parental controls for our service to improve the experience for family members of all ages. Updates include (i) PIN-controlled access to content by maturity level; (ii) the \\u200b \\u200b ability to PIN protect specific titles as well as profiles; (iii) Profile-level content filtering; (iv) the ability to create kids’ experiences that can be customized for different age groups (‘teens and below,’ ‘older kids and below’ and ‘little kids’); and (v) the ability to disable post-play for kids from account settings. Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q1, net cash used in operating activities was +$260 million vs. -$380 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 totaled +$162 million compared with -$460 million in the year ago quarter. As we stated last quarter, our FCF profile is beginning to improve due to growing operating margin and profits and as we digest our big move into the production of Netflix originals (which requires more cash upfront vs. later-window content) that started five years ago. With our productions currently paused, this will shift out some cash spending on content to future years. As a result, we’re now expecting 2020 FCF of -$1 billion or better (compared with our prior 2020 expectation of -$2.5 billion and -$3.3 billion actual in 2019). This dynamic may result in more lumpiness 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5in our path to sustained FCF profitability (as, prior to the pandemic, we had been planning for annual improvement in FCF). However, there has been no material change to our overall time table to reach consistent annual positive FCF and we believe that 2019 will still represent the peak in our annual FCF deficit. We finished the quarter with cash of $5.2 billion, while our $750m unsecured credit facility remains undrawn. Combined with our improved FCF outlook for 2020, we have more than 12 months of liquidity and substantial financial flexibility. Our financing strategy remains unchanged - our current plan is to continue to use debt to finance our investment needs.

       "  \"Revenue grew 24% year over year and was in line withour beginning of quarter forecast, while operating profit and margin reached all-time highs. We finishedQ1’21 with 208m paid memberships, up 14% year over year, but below our guidance forecast of 210mpaid memberships. We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forwardin 2020 and a lighter content slate in the firsthalf of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays. We continueto anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hitsand an exciting film lineup. In the short-term, thereis some uncertainty from Covid-19; in the long-term,the rise of streaming to replace linear TV aroundthe world is the clear trend in entertainment. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Average revenue per membership1rose 6% year overyear, or 5%, excluding a foreign exchange impact of +$80m. Operating income of $2 billion vs. $958 millionmore than doubled vs. Q1’20. This exceeded our guidance forecast primarily due to the timing of contentspend. EPS of $3.75 vs. $1.57 a year ago included a $253m non-cash unrealized gain from F/Xremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The extraordinary events of Covid-19 led to unprecedentedmembership growth in 2020, as it pulled forward growth from 2021, and delayed production acrossevery region. In turn, we ended 2020 with a bigger membership and revenue base than we would otherwisehave had, contributing to record Q1’21 revenues. And since we were still ramping productionlevels late last year, we had lower content spendin 1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesales taxes or VAT. Q1’21 - content amortization only grew 9.5% year over year in Q1’21 vs. 17% in FY20. The result was a 10 percentage point year over year jump in our operatingmargin to 27% in Q1, which is an all-time high. As we discussed in past letters, these dynamics arealso contributing to a lighter content slate in thefirst half of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth. In Q1, paid net additions of 4m were below our 6m guidance (and the 16m net additions inthe year ago quarter) primarily due to acquisition, as retention in Q1 was in line with our expectations.We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor inthe variance as the over-forecast was across allof our regions. We also saw similar percentage year-over-yeardeclines in paid net adds in all regions (see our Regional Breakdown table below), whereas the levelof competitive intensity varies by country. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be highrelative to our guidance forecast and, in others,it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. Asour membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paidnet additions performance vs. forecast. With similar pull forward and delayed slate dynamicsplus our typical seasonality expected to impact Q2’21, we project paid net additions of 1m (vs. 10min the prior year quarter) with our UCAN and LATAM regions expected to be roughly flattish in memberships(+/- a couple hundred thousand paid net adds). We anticipate paid membership growth will re-acceleratein the second half of 2021 as we ramp into a very strong back half slate with the return of bighits likeSex Education,The Witcher,La Casa dePapel (akaMoney Heist), andYou, as well as an excitingarray of original films including the finale toTheKissing Boothtrilogy and large scale, star-driven featureslikeRed Notice(starring Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds) andDon’t Look Up(with an all-starcast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and MerylStreep). We’ll also have our most comprehensive offering to date of local language titlesincludingToo Hot to Handlefor Brazil and Mexico, 2a special based on our Korean hit franchiseKingdom, the action-thrillerDhamaka(India), as well as new seasons ofSintonia(Brazil), andControl Z(Mexico). As always, we’re focusing on the fundamentals of ourbusiness, which remain healthy. In addition to our record financial results, engagement per member householdgrew solidly year over year in Q1’21. We’re also seeing how much members value Netflix with Q1’21churn below Q1‘20 levels, demonstrating that as we improve the service, we can charge a bit more.Our FY21 operating margin target of 20% vs. 18% last year remains unchanged. We are optimistic aboutthe future and believe we are still in the earlydays of the adoption of internet entertainment, which shouldprovide us with many years of growth ahead. Content As seen in the weekly growth chart above, in earlyQ1, with the benefit ofBridgerton,LupinandCobra Kai, we were following a growth trajectory similarto recent years. As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will leadto a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises.And while the roll out of vaccines is very uneven across the world, we are back up and producing safelyin every major market, with the exception of Brazil and India. Assuming this continues, we’ll spendover $17 billion in cash on content this year and we’ll continue to deliver an amazing range of titlesfor our members with more originals this year than last. There are several facets to our content strategy.First and foremost, we want to deliver a wide varietyof best-in-class stories that our members love and watchin big numbers. Examples of this breadth in Q1 include season one ofFirefly Lane(49m chose to watchthis title in its first 28 days), season 3 ofCobra Kai(45m),Fate: The Winx Saga(57m), andGinny &Georgia(52m). Our top movies in Q1 includeI CareA Lot(56m),YES DAY(62m),Outside the Wire(66m) andthe last installment ofTo All the Boys I’ve Loved 3Beforetrilogy (51m). We program across many genres because tastes are very diverse. Even for one person, what they desire will vary widely dependingon their mood or who they are watching with. Another goal is to create great, locally authenticstories in countries all around the world. It’s whyour priority for local language titles is to have a bigimpact in the home territory so we don’t sacrificelocal impact for “travelability.” But we’re increasinglyseeing that these local titles find significant audiences around the world, which supports our thesis that greatstories are universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Notable standoutsthis quarter includeBelow Zerofrom Spain (47m chose to watch in its first four weeks),Space Sweepersfrom Korea (26m),Squared Lovefrom Poland (31m) andWho Killed Sara?from Mexico (an estimated55m), which is also our most popular non-English title ever in the US in its first 28 days(with season 2 launching on May 19). We want our titles to be talked about by audiencesacross the globe. Because of our broad distribution and highly engaged members, our titles not only generatehigh levels of viewing but also can pierce the cultural zeitgeist and transcend the film and TV industry. There were two recent standout examples of this:Lupin, our French language series about a daringgentleman burglar played by Omar Sy, was not only our most popular new title this quarter on Netflix(76m member households chose to watch in the first 28 days), but it alsopropelled book salesofthe novel in France;Lupin: Part 2will debut laterin Q2’21. Similarly, driven by the late December launchof season one ofBridgerton, Julia Quinn’s bookshit The New York Timesbestseller list for the first timein 18 years. Netflix led all studios for recent award nominationsincluding the Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG Awards, BAFTA and the NAACP Image Awards, among others. Headinginto the Academy Awards this weekend, we have 36 nominations across 17 films including twonominees in each of the Best Picture (Mank,The Trial of the Chicago 7), Best Documentary Feature(Crip Camp,My Octopus Teacher), and Best Animated Feature (Over the Moon,A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon)categories.Mankled all films with 10 nominations. Product We are constantly working to make it easier for membersto access and enjoy something they will love, regardless of their location or mood. In Q1, we launchedan opt-inDownloads for Youfeature for Android (with iOS coming soon) that automatically downloadsrecommended shows and movies onto a member's mobile device, ensuring that they alwayshave something to watch irrespective of connectivity. Knowing that bandwidth and storage canbe precious, this feature tries to choose only the most relevant content to download. This quarter we also launchedFast Laughs, a mobilefeed of short comedy clips from Netflix favorites- it's initially available in several countries includingthe US on iOS and will be on Android soon. For television viewers, this month we unveiled an updatedand improved experience for Kids Profile that more vividly and easilyconnects childrenwith theirfavorite titles and characters. 4Competition We compete with many activities for consumers’ entertainmenttime, ranging from watching linear TV, video gaming, and viewing user generated content,just to name a few. Against this backdrop, the entertainment market is huge, giving us plenty ofroom to grow, if we can continue to improve our service. We believe we are less than 10% of TV screentime in the US and even smaller in other regions and when including mobile devices. More and more new streaming services are launching,reinforcing our vision that linear TV will slowly give way to streaming entertainment. Despite our 10+year head start, we are continually seeking operational and creative excellence; we’re workingas hard as ever to continually improve our serviceso that we are the best entertainment option availablewith best in class stories, an ever-improving product experience and authentic local titles that our memberslove. Our ability to evolve from a DVD-by-mail to an internet entertainment business, from a US-onlyto a global service, and from a licensor of second window content to a producer of original content acrossso many different categories fuels our confidence and optimism for our next decade of challenges,growth and innovation. When comparing services, subscriber figures alonetell only part of the story (given bundles, discounts and other promotions) so it’s important to also focuson engagement and revenue as key indicators of success; they drive the flywheel of investment ineven more amazing stories for our members and future growth. It’s our job to please our members so muchon Monday, that on Tuesday, they start with us, and then they stick with us as their first choice forentertainment. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was$777 million vs. $260 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was$692 million vs. $162 million in Q1‘20. We are ontrack for full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximatelybreak even. As we discussed last quarter, we believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positiveand that we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repaid our 5.375% February1, 2021 bond ($500 million principal) out of balance sheet cash, reducing our total gross debt balanceto $15.7 billion as of March 31, 2021. We intend to maintain $10-$15 billion of gross debt. Our boardhas approved a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock beginning in 2021 with no fixedexpiration date. We expect our buyback program will begin this quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We’ve added a new section to our investor relationssite that collates all of ourESG informationforour investors, including our recently published2020 ESGReport(filed March 30, 2021). Our 2020 ESG report includes our commitment to achieve net zero greenhousegas emissions by the end of 2022.

       "  \"Our revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show. Streaming is winning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently. While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth - through improvements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing - we’ll be holding our operating margin at around 20%. Key to our success has been our ability to create amazing entertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewing than our competitors. These are Netflix's core strengths and competitive advantages. Together with our strong profitability, we believe we have the foundation from which we can both significantly improve, and better monetize, our service longer term. Growth Outlook Since launching streaming in 2007, we’ve operated under the firm belief that internet-delivered, on demand entertainment will supplant linear TV, and that this transition represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a highly popular and profitable entertainment company. People love movies, TV shows and games; broadband and smart TV penetration continue to grow globally with more and more connected devices; and while hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world’s broadband homes don’t yet, representing huge future growth potential. 1In the near term though, we’re not growing revenue as fast as we’d like. COVID clouded the picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021 was due to the COVID pull forward. Now, we believe there are four main inter-related factors at work. First, it’s increasingly clear that the pace of growthinto our underlying addressable market (broadband homes) is partly dependent on factors we don’t directly control, like the uptake of connected TVs (since the majority of our viewing is on TVs), the adoption of on-demand entertainment, and data costs. We believe these factors will keep improving over time, so that all broadband households will be potential Netflix customers. Second, in addition to our 222m paying households,we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over 100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region. Account sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn’t changed much over the years, but, coupled with the first factor, means it’s harder to grow membership in many markets - an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth. Third, competition for viewing with linear TV as wellas YouTube, Amazon, and Hulu has been robust for the last 15 years. However, over the last three years, as traditional entertainment companies realized streaming is the future, many new streaming services have also launched. While our US television viewing share, for example, has been steady to up according to Nielsen, we want to grow that share faster. Higher view share is an indicator of higher satisfaction, which supports higher retention and revenue. Fourth, macro factors, including sluggish economicgrowth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID are likely having an impact as well. 2Our plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix - in particular the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our members value most. On the content side, we’re doubling down on story development and creative excellence, which we see reflected in big Q1’22 TV hits likeBridgerton(627 million hours viewed for season 21*, our biggest English language series in our history) andInventing Anna(512m hours viewed) - both from our extremely successful partnership with Shonda Rhimes - and films likeTinder Swindler(166m hours viewed, our biggest documentary film ever released) andThe Adam Project(233m hours viewed), which come on the back of our Q4 hitsRed NoticeandDon’tLook Up. On the product side, we recently launched “double thumbs up” so members can better express what they truly love versus simply like - enabling us to continue to improve our personalized recommendations and overall experience. This focus on continuous improvement has served us well over the past 25 years - from our big battle with Blockbuster nearly 20 years ago through the launch and growth of streaming, to the switch from licensed second run TV series and films to original programming, and our development from a domestic business with primarily English language content to a global entertainment service. It’s why we are now the largest subscription streaming service in the world on all key metrics: paid memberships, engagement, revenue and profit. Another focus is how best to monetize sharing - the 100M+ households using another household’s account. This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying our service. Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. And we've always tried to make sharingwithina member’shousehold easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams. While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households. So early last year we started testing different approaches to monetize sharing and, in March, introduced two newpaid sharing features, where current members have the choice to pay for additional households, in three markets in Latin America. There’s a broad range of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing. So while we won’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity. As we work to monetize sharing, growth in ARM, revenue and viewing will become more important indicators of our success than membership growth. Over the longer term, much of our growth will come from outside the US. Traditionally, US entertainment companies have viewed “international” as an export market for US content. But we saw long ago that great stories can be made anywhere and loved everywhere - dramatically broadening the pool of creators with whom we can work, increasing the variety of our programming and better serving local tastes. To support this, we’ve been building out capabilities like creative development, personalization, and language presentation/localization. Netflix is now producing films and TV in more than 50 countries with a high degree of integration in the local entertainment ecosystem resulting in the creation of blockbusters from every region. In fact, three out of our six most popular TV seasons of all time are non-English language titles:Squid Game,La Casa de PapelPart 4 andAll Of Us Are Dead, which 1Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through April 17, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 3launched in Q1’22 and has accumulated 561m hours viewed in its first four weeks. So an important focus is working to extend our lead in this area. Our goal is to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating income even faster (as we expand margins) and generate growing positive free cash flow (FCF). During this period of slower revenue growth, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange (F/X), we aim to protect our profitability and manage to a minimum operating margin roughly in line with current levels (i.e., this year’s 19-20% guidance). Once we’ve re-accelerated revenue growth, we’re committed to steadily growing our operating margin. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Our 10% revenue growth in Q1’22 was driven by an 8% year over year increase in average streaming paid memberships and 2% year over year growth in ARM2.Excluding a F/X impact of -$280 million, year over year revenue and ARM growth were +14% and +6%, respectively. Operating income of $2.0 billion was above our beginning of quarter forecast of $1.8 billion due to lower than projected content expense. EPS of $3.53 vs. $3.75 a year ago included a $162 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Paid net additions were -0.2m compared against our guidance forecast of 2.5m and 4.0m in the same quarter a year ago. The suspension of our service in Russia and winding-down of all Russian paid memberships resulted in a -0.7m impact on paid net adds; excluding this impact, paid net additions totaled +0.5m. The main challenge for membership growth is continued soft acquisition across all regions. Retention was also slightly lower relative to our guidance forecast, although it remains at a very healthy level (we believe among the best in the industry). Recent price changes are largely tracking in-line with our expectations and remain significantly revenue positive. In EMEA (-0.3M paid net adds, or +0.4m excluding the Russia impact), we saw a slowdown in our business in Central and Eastern Europe in March, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Paid net additions in LATAM totaled -0.4M; similar to recent quarters, we believe a combination of forces including macroeconomic weakness and our price changes (F/X neutral ARM grew 20% year over year) were a drag on our membership growth. UCAN paid net adds of -0.6M was largely the result of our price change which is tracking in-line with our expectations and is significantly revenue positive. We’re making good progress in APAC where we are seeing nice growth in a variety of markets including Japan, India, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2’22, we forecast paid net additions of -2.0m vs. +1.5m in the year ago quarter. Our forecast assumes our current trends persist (such as slow acquisition and the near term impact of price changes) plus typical seasonality (Q2 paid net adds are usually less than Q1 paid net adds). We project revenue to grow approximately 10% year over year in Q2, assuming roughly a mid-to-high single digit year over year 2ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 4increase in ARM on a F/X neutral basis. We still target a 19%-20% operating margin for the full year 2022, assuming no material swings in F/X rates from when we set this goal in January of 2022. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $923 million vs. $777 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow3amounted to $802 million vs.$692 million. We continue to expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. During the quarter, we completed two acquisitions (leading visual effects companyScanlineand gaming studioBoss Fight Entertainment), which had a -$125million impact on cash. We also announced our purchase of Helsinki-based gaming companyNext Games.We’ve completed the tender offer and expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2022. We finished Q1 with gross debt of $14.6 billion after repaying $700 million of our senior notes. We’re now within the top end of our gross debt target range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $6.0 billion, net debt was $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter, equating to a 1.3x LTM leverage ratio4. Given those uses of cash and our minimum cash target, we didn’t engage in share repurchase activity during the quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We recently published our2021 ESG Report(March 30,2022). We’ve made good progress on ourclimate commitmentsannounced last year - reducing or avoidingmore than 14,000 metric tons of emissions in 2021. This enabled us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 footprint by more than 10% from what it otherwise would have been and puts us on track to cut 45% of these emissions by 2030. We continue to develop our inclusion lens. In 2021, women made up 51.7% of our global workforce5, up from 48.7% in 2020. Half of our US workforce (50.5%) is made up of people from one or more historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds, including Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern, Native American, and Pacific Islander6. That’s upfrom 46.8% in the previous year. The number of US Black employees increased from 8.6% to 10.7% and Black leadership increased from 10.9% to 13.3%. The number of US Hispanic or Latino employees increased from 7.9% to 8.6%, and US Hispanic or Latino leadership grew slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%.

       "  \"We live in uncertain times with restrictions on what we can do socially and many people are turning to entertainment for relaxation, connection, comfort and stimulation. In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant pull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million paid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million). As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020 compared to the prior year. As we navigate these turbulent circumstances, we’re focused on our members by continuing to improve the quality of our service and bringing new films and shows to people's screens. Our Q2 summary results and forecast for Q3 are in the table below. Ted Sarandos appointed co-CEO and elected to Board of Directors Ted joined Netflix over 20 years ago, and we are thrilled to appoint him to be co-CEO with Reed. “Ted has been my partner for decades. This change makes formal what was already informal -- that Ted and I share the leadership of Netflix,” says Hastings. Lead Independent director Jay Hoag says “Having watched Reed and Ted work together for so long, the board and I are confident this is the right step to evolve Netflix’s management structure so that we can continue to best serve our members and shareholders for years to come.” 1Ted will also continue to serve as Chief Content Officer. In addition, Greg Peters has been appointed COO adding to his Chief Product Officer role. “We want Greg to help us stay aligned and effective as we grow so quickly around the world,” said Hastings. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast In Q2, revenue grew 25% year over year, while quarterly operating income exceeded $1 billion. Average streaming paid memberships in Q2 rose 25% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 0.4% year over year. Excluding a -$289m impact from foreign exchange (F/X), streaming ARPU grew 5% year over year. Operating margin expanded 770 basis points year over year to 22.1%, above our guidance forecast due to higher than expected membership and revenue growth. In addition, content and marketing expenses were lower than we expected, as the pandemic delayed some planned spend. EPS of $1.59 vs. $0.60 a year ago included a $119m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt and a $220m non-cash valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (due to recent legislation limiting the use of California R&D credits). Our Q2 effective tax rate of 30.5% includes about a 21% point negative impact due to the valuation allowance. We added a Q2-record 10.1m paid memberships vs. 2.7m in last year’s Q2. The positive variance relative to our 7.5m forecast was due to better-than-forecast acquisition and retention. In the first half of this year, we’ve added 26m paid memberships, nearly on par with the 28m we achieved in all of 2019. However, as we expected (and can be seen in the graph below), growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions. Our paid net additions for the month of June also included the subscriptions we cancelled for the small percentage of members who had not used the \\u200b \\u200b service recently. 2The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. We forecast 2.5m paid net adds for Q3’20 vs. 6.8m in the prior year quarter. As we indicated in our Q1’20 letter, we’re expecting paid net adds will be down year over year in the second half as our strong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year. In addition, Q3’19 included the positive impact of new seasons of both Stranger Things and La Casa de \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Papel (aka Money Heist). We continue to view the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b that meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment which we believe provides us with many years of strong growth ahead. For the full year 2020, we’re still targeting a 16% operating margin. We’re currently on track to exceed 16% although F/X (and the relative strength of the US dollar) remains a wildcard. As always, our intention is to grow our annual operating margin year over year - we’re currently targeting 19% for 2021. Content As the world slowly re-opens, our main business priority is to restart our productions safely and in a manner consistent with local health and safety standards to ensure that our members can enjoy a diverse range of high quality new content. Given the significant differences between countries (e.g., incidence of new Covid-19 cases, availability of testing, government and industry regulations), there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and we’re adapting to local circumstances. Today, we’re slowly resuming productions in many parts of the world. We are furthest along in Asia Pacific (where we never fully shut down in Korea, for example) and are now shooting live action series like season 2 of our Japanese original The Naked Director. In EMEA, we are now back in production in \\u200b \\u200b many countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Italy, and the UK. While we recently resumed production on two films in California and two stop-motion animation projects in Oregon and expect some more of our US productions to get going this quarter, current infection trends create more uncertainty for our productions in the US. Parts of the world like India and some of Latin America are also more challenging and we are hoping to restart later in the year in these regions. Since our content production lead time is long, our 2020 plans for launching original shows and films continue to be largely intact. For 2021, based on our current plan, we expect the paused productions will lead to a more second half weighted content slate in terms of our big titles, although we anticipate the total number of originals for the full year will still be higher than 2020. We’ll also round out our content offering with film acquisitions like The Trial of the Chicago 7 from Aaron Sorkin and The \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run (global excluding US and China). We also acquired nearly \\u200b completed seasons of unreleased original series like Cobra Kai (seasons 1, 2 and a brand new season 3) \\u200b \\u200b and Emily in Paris starring Lily Collins. \\u200b \\u200b The pandemic and pauses in production are impacting our competitors and suppliers similarly. With our large library of thousands of titles and strong recommendations, we believe our member satisfaction will remain high. 3In Q2, we notched successes in many of our key content verticals. In English scripted TV, Never Have I \\u200b Ever, a fun, young adult dramedy from Mindy Kaling, broke through with 40m households choosing to \\u200b watch this show in its first four weeks, and 40m households for our new comedy Space Force (starring \\u200b \\u200b Steve Carell). On the heels of Love is Blind, Too Hot to Handle and Floor is Lava are the latest in our line \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b of buzzy unscripted shows (51m and a projected 37m households, respectively, in the first four weeks). In original films, 27 million households chose to watch Spike Lee’s Da 5 Bloods, which was celebrated as \\u200b \\u200b a “soul stirring film for the ages.” Extraction (starring Chris Hemsworth) and The Wrong Missy, a comedy \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b starring David Spade and Lauren Lapkus, were also big hits with audiences (99m and 59m households, respectively, chose to watch in their first 28 days). In addition, The Willoughbys (38m households in the \\u200b \\u200b first four weeks) is an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster our offering for kids and families. We also saw increased viewing for some older titles like 13th, American Son and Dear White People - all \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b part of our Black Lives Matter Collection - as our members sought out stories that speak to racial \\u200b \\u200b injustice and the Black experience in America. Our local language originals - like Dark in Germany, Control Z in Mexico, Extracurricular in Korea, The \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Woods in Poland, or Blood & Water in South Africa - continue to be highly impactful, driving large \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b viewing, buzz and sign-ups in their home countries. We continue to see these stories find audiences all over the world. The best example of this was La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist): Part 4, which we \\u200b \\u200b launched on April 3; through its first 28 days, 65m households chose to watch this hit show. For Q3, we recently released The Old Guard (starring Charlize Theron), which continues our recent string \\u200b \\u200b of adrenaline-filled action movies. Later in July, we’re looking forward to launching season 2 of The \\u200b Umbrella Academy, followed by The Kissing Booth 2 (the sequel to our hit romantic comedy), Project \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Power (an action movie starring Jamie Foxx) and Enola Holmes (featuring Millie Bobbie Brown as the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b sister of Sherlock Holmes, played by Henry Cavill) later in the quarter. Product and Partnerships We continue to test different pricing approaches in some countries including lower priced, mobile-only plans and our bundled offerings with MVPDs and ISPs. While some of these carry lower ARPU, the goal is to accelerate membership growth on neutral-to-better short term revenue (with incremental acquisition and improved retention offsetting the lower price). We think this strategy will increase long term revenue as a larger membership base can generate more word-of-mouth around our content and help us better understand peoples’ needs in that country - so that we can more quickly improve our catalog and product experience, which would then lead to higher member satisfaction and growth as well as improved long term retention. A very small percentage of our members have not watched anything for the last two years and although we make it easy for people to cancel their subscriptions with just a few clicks, they have not taken advantage of that ability. So we decided to stop billing them and will do so for members meeting the same criteria going forward. Like all of our former members, they can easily restart their membership in the future. While this change resulted in a slight hit to revenue, we believe that pro-consumer policies 4like this are the right thing to do and that the long term benefits will outweigh the short term costs. In a world where consumers have many subscriptions, auto-pause on billing after an extended period of non-use should be how leading services operate. Competition All of the major entertainment companies like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal are pushing their own streaming services and two of the most valuable companies in the world, Apple and Amazon, are growing their investment in premium content. In addition, TikTok’s growth is astounding, showing the fluidity of internet entertainment. Instead of worrying about all these competitors, we continue to stick to our strategy of trying to improve our service and content every quarter faster than our peers. Our continued strong growth is a testament to this approach and the size of the entertainment market. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated in operating activities in Q2 was +$1 billion vs. -$544 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 was positive for a second consecutive quarter at +$899m vs. -$594 million. Free cash flow was higher than net income due primarily to the loss on FX remeasurement and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, both of which were non-cash items that reduced net income. Our FCF profile is continuing to improve, which is being driven in part by our growing operating margin and the digestion of our big move into the production of Netflix originals that requires more cash upfront vs. licensed content. In addition, the pause in production has also pushed out cash spending on content into the second half of 2020 and into 2021. Due to the pause in production from the pandemic combined with higher-than-forecast paid net adds year to date, we now expect free cash flow for the full year 2020 to be breakeven to positive, compared with our prior expectation for -$1 billion or better. As we indicated last quarter, in 2021 we project that full year free cash flow will dip back to being negative again, although we believe the FCF deficit will be materially better than our peak deficit level of -$3.3 billion in 2019. There has been no material change in our overall estimated timetable to reach consistent annual positive FCF within the next few years. We’re often asked by investors what our FCF profile would be at “steady state” or when our cash content spending matches our content amortization. The pandemic and the resulting pause in productions provides one early snapshot of what that may look like. In Q2’20, our cash spending on content was $2.6 billion, equivalent to our content amortization of $2.6 billion, or a 1x cash content-to-content amortization ratio2. This resulted in a FCF margin of +15% in Q2. Of course, our plan is to continue to grow our content spend (as we don’t believe we are anywhere near maturity), but the above analysis may prove illustrative. And by the time our cash content-to-content amortization ratio 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 2 For additional details on these concepts, please refer to our Content Accounting Overview slide deck on our investor relations site. \\u200b \\u200b 5reaches 1x on a sustained basis (which is still many years away), we hope to have many more members and much greater revenue, operating margin and FCF. In April, we raised $1 billion of debt at a blended rate of ~3.3% across both US dollar and Euro tranches. We ended Q2 with more than $7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. As part of our commitment to racial equity, we allocated about two percent of our cash holdings - initially up to $100 million - into financial institutions and organizations that directly support Black \\u200b communities in the US. We hope other US large-caps will also consider taking this small and relatively \\u200b easy step to bolster US racial economic equity. With our cash balance, $750 million credit facility (which remains undrawn) and improving FCF profile, we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for over 12 months. As a result, we don’t expect to access the debt markets for the remainder of 2020 and we believe our need for external financing is diminishing.

       "  'In Q2, revenue increased 19% year over year to $7.3billion, while operating income rose 36% year over year to $1.8 billion. We finished the quarter withover 209m paid memberships, slightly ahead of our forecast. COVID has created some lumpiness in ourmembership growth (higher growth in 2020, slower growth this year), which is working its way through.We continue to focus on improving our service for our members and bringing them the best stories fromaround the world. Our summary results and forecast for Q3 are below. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Revenue growth was driven by an 11% increase in averagepaid streaming memberships and 8% growth in average revenue per membership (ARM)1. ARM rose4%, excluding a foreign exchange (FX) impact of +$277m. Operating margin of 25.2% expanded 3 percentagepoints compared with the year ago quarter. EPS of $2.97 vs. $1.59 a year ago included a $63mnon-cash unrealized loss from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The pandemic has created unusual choppiness in ourgrowth and distorts year-over-year comparisons as acquisition and engagement per member household spikedin the early months of COVID. In Q2’21, our engagement per member household was, as expected,down vs. those unprecedented levels but was still up 17% compared with a more comparable Q2’19. Similarly,retention continues to be strong and better than pre-COVID Q2’19 levels, even as average revenueper membership has grown 8% over this two-year 1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesales taxes or VAT. 1period, demonstrating how much our members value Netflix and that as we improve our service we can charge a bit more. We added 1.5m paid memberships in Q2, slightly aheadof our 1.0m guidance forecast. The APAC region represented about two-thirds of our global paid net adds in the quarter. As expected, Q2 paid memberships in the UCAN region were slightly downsequentially (-0.4m paid net adds). We believe our large membership base in UCAN coupled with a seasonallysmaller quarter for acquisition is the main reason for this dynamic. This is similar to what weexperienced in Q2’19 when our UCAN paid net adds were -0.1m; since then we’ve added nearly 7.5m paidnet adds in UCAN. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q3’21, we forecast paid net additions of 3.5mvs. 2.2m in the prior year period. If we achieve our forecast, we will have added more than 54m paid netadds over the past 24 months or 27m on an annualized basis over that time period, which is consistentwith our pre-COVID annual rate of net additions. We forecast that ARM will grow roughly5% year over year on a FX neutral basis in Q3’21. We continue to target a 20% operating margin for thefull year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. After our big global launch in January 2016, we committed to steadily growingour operating margin thereafter at an average rate of three percentage points per year over anyfew-year period. Some years we’ll be a little over(like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021).Assuming we achieve our margin target this year,we will have quintupled our operating margin in the lastfive years and are tracking ahead of this average annual three percentage point pace. 2With revenue and margin both increasing, our operatingprofit dollars have risen dramatically as well (even as we have been investing heavily), from about$100 million per quarter in 2016 to nearly $2 billion per quarter so far in 2021. Our belief isthat as we steadily improve our service to betterplease our members, this will lead to continued growth inour membership base, ARM, revenue, operating margin and profit dollars. Content We launched our first original scripted TV seriesin 2012 and we’ve since expanded our original programming effort to many additional categories,from all over the world. Our goal is to be everyone’s first choice for entertainment because of the varietyand quality of our titles. And despite the COVID-related production delays in 2020, we were ableto deliver an exciting portfolio of titles in Q2’21 that exemplify this ambition. For example,Shadow and Bone, a fantasy series basedon the popularGrishaverse book series, proved to be very popular with our members. Over 55m memberhouseholds chose to watch this show in its first 28 days and we’ve renewed it for a second season.Sweet Tooth, based on the beloved DC comic, was another hit series with 60m member households choosingthis title in its first four weeks. Our expansion into non-fiction series is going well.This past quarter, standout unscripted titles include season two of dating showToo Hot to Handleand socialexperiment reality programThe Circle(an estimated 29m and 14m, respectively, chose to watchin the first 28 days) as well as the true crime docu-seriesThe Sons of Sam(19m). We’re buildingout some of these unscripted titles with local versions of the same formats. As one example,TooHot to Handle: BrazilandToo Hot to Handle: Latino will be launching later in July and September, respectively,to serve our LATAM region. 3We’re also quickly growing both our live action and animated original film offering, with several impactful titles in Q2. Zack Snyder’sArmy of the Deadwas a blockbuster as 75m member households chose to watch this action packed zombie spectaclein its first 28 days of release. As an extensionto Army of the Dead, a prequel,Army of Thieves, willbe released in Q4’21 along with a spinoff anime series later in 2022.Fatherhood, a dramedy starring KevinHart, was another hit, drawing an estimated 74m member households in its first 28 days. And Q2 alsofeatured our biggest Netflix animated film to date with 53m member households choosing to watchThe Mitchellsvs. The Machines. Last week, Netflix series and specials received 129Emmy nominations. With 24 nominations,The Crown tied for the most nominated series.Bridgertonwith12 nominations was also nominated for Best Drama series whileThe Queen’s Gambitreceived 18 nominationsincluding Best Limited Series.Cobra Kai,Emily In Parisand the finale season ofThe Kominsky Methodwere all nominated for Best Comedy series. Beyond this acclaim, these are also among our popularseries on Netflix. Our non-English content investments are growing bothin scope and impact. Our P&L content expense for this content category has more than doubled inthe past two years. Illustrating how great storiescan come from anywhere and be loved everywhere, part twoofLupinfrom France was our largest non-English title in the quarter with 54m member householdschoosing this title in its first four weeks. Season four ofElitefrom Spain drew 37m member householdsin its first 28 days, while season two of Who Killed Sara?built on the success of the firstseason with 34m households choosing the latest installment of this gripping thriller from Mexico. As discussed in previous letters, COVID-related productiondelays in 2020 have led to a lighter first half of 2021 slate that will build through the course of theyear. In the first six months of 2021, content amortization grew only 9% year over year (as comparedto 17% in FY20). COVID and its variants make predicting the future hard, but with productions largelyrunning smoothly so far, we’re optimistic in our ability to deliver a strong second half slate. Throughthe first half of 2021 we’ve already spent $8 billion in cash on content (up 41% yr-over-yr and 1.4x ourcontent amortization) and we expect content amortization to be around $12 billion for the fullyear (+12% year over year). Our Q3 slate will include new seasons of fan favoritesLa Casa de Papel(akaMoney Heist),Sex Education, Virgin RiverandNever Have I Everas well as live action films includingSweet Girl (starring Jason Momoa),Kissing Booth3, and Kate(starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the animatedfeature filmVivo, featuring all-new songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda. We’re also in the early stages of further expandinginto games, building on our earlier efforts around interactivity (eg,Black Mirror Bandersnatch) andourStranger Thingsgames. We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansioninto original films, animation and unscripted TV. Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscriptionat no additional cost similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games formobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our movies and TV series offering and we expect a long runwayof increasing investment and growth across all ofour existing content categories, but since we are nearlya decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about howour members value games. Product 4We’re constantly innovating across a broad range of areas to improve the viewing experience and better serve our members. That’s why this quarter we globallylaunchedPlay Somethingon television, ournew featurethat lets Netflix do the work when you don’tfeel like choosing what to watch. Recognizing that broadband quality and cost varies around the world,we also improved the Netflix download experience to enable you to start watching a show or film evenif it hasn’t finished downloading. Once you reconnect, you can complete the partial download andkeep watching — also helping members avoid exceeding their data limits. We recently expanded our low-cost mobile-only planto an additional 78 countries across South East Asia and sub-saharan Africa. Like in our other markets,this plan complements our existing three tiers of service. In the five markets where we had previouslylaunched a mobile-only plan, we have found that the mobile only plan has been an effective way tointroduce more consumers to Netflix while being roughly revenue neutral as the lower average revenueper membership is offset by incremental acquisition and generally better retention. Competition We are still very much in the early days of the transitionfrom linear to on-demand consumption of entertainment. Streaming represents just 27% of USTV screen time, compared with 63% for linear television, according to Nielsen. Based on this samestudy, Nielsen estimates that we are just 7% of US TV screen time. Considering that we are less maturein other countries and that this excludes mobile screens (where we believe our share of engagementis even lower), we are confident that we have a long runway for growth. As we improve our service, ourgoal is to continue to increase our share of screen time in the US and around the world. 5Share of Total US TV Time, June 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) The planned combination of Warner Media Group andDiscovery and Amazon’s pending acquisition of MGM are examples of the ongoing industry consolidationas firms adapt to a world where streaming supplants linear TV. The industry has consolidatedmaterially over the years (Time Warner/AT&T, Viacom/CBS, Discovery/Scripps, Disney/Fox, Comcast/NBCU/Sky,etc.) and we don’t believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if atall. While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as “must-have” and we haven’tyet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon. In the race to entertain consumers around the world,we continue to compete for screen time with a broad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok(to name just a few). But, we are mostly competing with ourselves to improve our service asfast as we can. If we can do that, we’re confidentwe can maintain our strong position and continue to grownicely as we have been over the past two-plus decades. Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q2, net cash generated by operating activitieswas -$64 million vs. $1 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was-$175 million vs. $899 million in Q2‘20. FCF in lastyear’s Q2 benefited from COVID-related production shutdowns.We are still expecting full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately break even. As we discussedpreviously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-dayoperations. 2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cashprovided by (used in) operating activities, pleaserefer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unauditedfinancial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6During Q2, we increased our revolving credit facility (which remains undrawn) to $1 billion from $750 million and extended the maturity from 2024 to 2026.We also repurchased 1m shares for $500 million (at an average per share price of about $500) underour $5 billion share authorization. Our main priority is to invest in the organic growth of our business while maintaining strong liquidity and retaining financial flexibility for strategic investments. Ourgrowing operating profit allows us to complementthis priority with a return of capital to shareholders. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In June, the independent sustainability think tankThe Carbon Trustpublished awhite paperexamining the carbon impact of video streaming.Key findingsof the work include:  The average carbon footprint for Europe per hour ofvideo streaming is approximately 55gCO2e, equivalent to driving 250 metres in an average petrolcar.  Devices (TVs, laptops/PCs, smartphones, tablets) makeup the largest portion of carbon emissions from streaming (over 50%), compared to othercomponents like energy from data centers or networks. Good news: Devices are gettingmore efficient over time and total device usage is fairly constant (with Netflix gaining sharefrom linear).  Changing resolutions and other viewing settings werefound to result in only a very small change in the carbon impact. Changing from standard definitionto 4K resolution grows transmission emissions from just under 1g CO2e/hour to just over1g CO2e/hour.  As demand for streaming and other internet servicesincreases, the carbon intensity of these services will decrease over time. This is due to (1)networking equipment becoming less energy-intensive with technological advances, and(2) increased use of renewable electricity. As a reminder, our ESG-related information can befound on ourIR website.

       "  'Q2 was better-than-expected on membership growth, and foreign exchange was worse-than-expected (stronger US dollar), resulting in 9% revenue growth (13% constant currency). Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product, content, and marketing as we’ve done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience. We’re in a position of strength given our $30 billion-plus in revenue, $6 billion in operating profit last year, growing free cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q2 Results Revenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year (or 13% excluding a -$339 million foreign currency impact), driven by a 6% and 2% increase in average paid memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), ARM rose 7% year over year. The appreciation of the US dollar (USD) vs. most other currencies since our April earnings report was the primary reason for the variance to our revenue guidance forecast. We slightly under-forecasted global paid net adds in Q2 (-1.0m vs. -2.0m forecast and compared to +1.5m in the year ago quarter).  In APAC, revenue grew 23% year over year, excluding F/X. At over $900 million of revenue, APAC is approaching the size of our LATAM business. We added 1.1m paid memberships in the region (vs. 1.0m last Q2). ARM in APAC was -2% year over year on a F/X neutral basis, due to the impact from our price decrease in India last December as well as plan mix, which was partially offset by 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1higher ARM in Korea and Australia. Excluding India, APAC ARM grew 4% year over year on a constant currency basis.  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM increased 13% and 6% year over year, respectively, while paid net additions totaled -0.8m vs. 0.2m in the year ago quarter.  Revenue in LATAM grew 19% year over year excluding F/X and surpassed the $1 billion quarterly mark for the first time, helped by constant currency ARM growth of 15%. Paid memberships were flat sequentially (compared to 0.8m paid net adds in Q2’21).  In UCAN, ARM and revenue each increased 10% year over year, excluding the impact of F/X. Paid net adds were -1.3m vs. -0.4m in the year ago period. Retention improved over the course of the quarter and, while churn remains slightly elevated, it is now back near pre-price change levels. We’ve adjusted our cost structure for our current rate of revenue growth. This resulted in approximately $70 million of severance costs and an $80m non-cash impairment of certain real estate leases primarily related to rightsizing our office footprint. Excluding these items totaling $150 million, and the F/X impact of the stronger US dollar since our April report, operating profit and operating margin were slightly ahead of our guidance forecast. EPS of $3.20 vs. $2.97 a year ago exceeded our guidance forecast of $3.00 due to a $305 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” Our approximately $5 billion of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge against the Euro for net income, but doesn’t affect operating income. Year to date, our gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro debt is $467 million. Q3 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the current uncertain macro-economic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. The US dollar continues to strengthen meaningfully against most currencies at ahistoric pace, withthe Euro recently falling below the US dollarfor thefirst time in two decades, a significant headwind for all multinational US companies. We have high exposure to this unprecedented appreciation in the USD because nearly 60% of our revenue comes from outside the US and swings in F/X have a large flow through to operating profit as most of our expenses are in USD and don’t benefit from a stronger USD. Our Q3 revenue growth forecast of 5% translates into 12% year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Similarly, excluding the impact of currency, operating profit growth would be -3% year over year (vs our forecast decline of -29%) and operating margin would be 20% (vs our forecast of 16%). As we have written in the past, over the medium term, we intend to continue to adjust our business as appropriate given the relative strength of the USD to protect our operating margin and try to avoid immediate actions that we believe could be detrimental to the business. We forecast paid net adds for Q3 of +1.0m vs. 4.4m in the year ago quarter. We continue to expect full year 2022 operating margin of 19%-20%, excluding the unanticipated $150m of restructuring costs in Q2 2noted above and the material movement in F/X from January 2022, as our guidance was set based on F/X at that time (see ourQ4’21 letter). Content, Marketing, and Product Last quarter, we discussed our slowing revenue growth, which we believe is the result of connected TV adoption, account sharing, competition, and macro factors such as sluggish economic growth and the impacts of the war in Ukraine. We’ve now had more time to understand these issues, as well as how best to address them. First and foremost, we need to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix. This focus on improving our core service has served us well over the past 25 years, and remains our north star to drive continuous growth. It’s why we strive for an ever better content, marketing and product experience. Also as a pure play streaming business, we’re unencumbered by legacy revenue streams. This freedom means we can offer big movies direct-to-Netflix, without the need for extended or exclusive theatrical windows, and let members binge watch TV if they want, without having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. This focus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believe to be a significant long term business advantage. Our content offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of member tastes by providing an unmatched variety and quality of titles. Our Q2 slate is emblematic of this approach, headlined by season four of Stranger Things, which returned to tremendous fanreception and was a smash hit by all measures - including an outstanding drama Emmy nomination (along withOzarkseason 4 andSquid Game). In its first four weeks,Stranger Thingsseason four generated1.3 billion hours viewed2, making it our biggest season of English TV ever. Season four also re-ignited interest in past episodes with season one through three experiencing a greater than five-fold increase in viewing in the month after the release of season four (vs. the prior month). Season four ofStranger Thingsalso showcased theeffectiveness of our marketing strategy in driving conversation around our titles. When we deliver shows and movies that members are talking about in large numbers, we can influence pop culture, build passion for Netflix and create an experience that is differentiated and difficult-to-replicate. For example, the show catapulted the 1985 songRunning Up That Hillto thetop of the music charts. Metallicaalso enjoyed a return to the charts in the US and UK with their 1986 songMaster of Puppetsafter beingfeatured in the new season ofStranger Things. The cumulative Twitter volume forStranger Thingscontinuesto outpace bothObi-Wan KenobiandTop Gun Maverick, highlighting the big conversation aroundthis title and reinforcing that our binge versus one week at a time release strategy drives lots of “water cooler conversation.” 2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release for each title; since some titles have multiple premiere dates, whether weekly or in parts, we count the 28 days from each episode premiere date in each country. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 17, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 3Source: Twitter. We also delivered a wide variety of other English language series hits in Q2, including season three of The Umbrella Academy(284m view hours*) and seasonone ofThe Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama, which generated 277m hours viewed and has been renewed for a second season. We’ve also renewed the endearing, UK-produced young adult dramaHeartstopper(67m view hours) for another two seasons. In unscripted, audiences embraced season five ofSellingSunset, which recorded 95m view hours in its first four weeks, while the debut season of marriage reality showThe Ultimatumhad 148m view hours. In unscripted, we are also taking global formats and creating local versions. This quarter, we hadRhythm + Flow France, our rap competition show, which wasa big local success. The winner of season one, Fresh, was formerly unknown, working in a gym. But since his appearance on the show, he has become a star with his song CHOP that he performed in the finale hitting #1 on every streaming service in France. He was also invited to the Les Ardentes music festival where he performed for an audience of 15,000 people - another example of \"The Netflix Effect.\" We’re making good progress in film. The basketball dramaHustle(starring Adam Sandler) was our biggest Netflix movie in Q2 (186m hours viewed) and was loved by critics and audiences alike, followed by the comedySenior Year, starring Rebel Wilson,with 161m view hours. We continue to invest in animated features; building off our initial titles likeOver the MoonandBackto the Outback, we releasedThe Sea Beast(102m hoursviewed*) early in Q3 to audience and critical acclaim. Today, we announced that we will be acquiring leading animation studioAnimal Logic, with ~800 amazing people mostly in Sydney and Vancouver, which will help us accelerate the development of our animation production capabilities and reinforces our commitment to build a world-class animation studio. We’ve been partnering with Animal Logic for two years now, working onThe Magician’s Elephant (directed by Wendy Rogers) and the recently announcedThe Shrinking of the Treehorns(directed by Ron Howard). Together, we’ll create an animation studio that will produce some of our largest animated 4feature films. We’ll fund the purchase from our existing cash balance. The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals and we anticipate closing later this year. We’re building on our lead in non-English programming. We want Netflix to be relevant to audiences all over the globe and our local language titles are a differentiator for us. We focus first on telling authentic stories for local impact, but we see that great stories can travel everywhere. Another example of this In Q2 wasThe Marked Heart, a Colombian series, whichfound a global audience and ended up in the top 10 in 81 countries around the world by its second week. Similarly,The Takedown, a French film, wasin the top 10 in 91 countries around the world by its second week, again showing the power of an authentic story and our ability to serve those stories - with subtitling, dubbing, and personalized discovery - for members to enjoy around the world. While we always have room to improve, we’re very pleased with how far we’ve come in providing so much satisfaction and enjoyment to our members. For instance, in the US, which is one of the most competitive markets in the world, we drewmore TVviewing time than any other outletduring the 2021-22 TV season (see chart below), nearly matching the combined total of the two most watched broadcast networks. And, as Nielsen will announce on Thursday, our share of US TV viewing reached an all-time high of 7.7% in June (vs. 6.6% in June 2021), demonstrating our ability to grow our engagement share as we continue to improve our service. Since our launch of a small selection of licensed mobile games last November, we’ve released new games every few weeks, with the portfolio growing to the current total of 24. The games are all intended to be accessible to broad audiences, and span several genres and categories, including racing with Asphalt Xtreme, the digital version of the irreverentcard gameExploding Kittens, zombies inInto the Dead 2and the knitting for cats inKnittens. We’vehad millions of our members play games through the service and we are learning about what games work for different audiences. We’re adapting our 5licensing and partner-based development activities in response to these learnings. We’ve also acquired three games studios (Night School Studios, Boss Fight Studios, and Next Games) which gives us a range of expertise in multiple geographies to accelerate the buildout of our internal development capacity. We are building a solid pipeline of new games that will launch over the next several years and are excited to see our members engage with these titles. Near Term Focus In the near term, a key priority to re-accelerate revenue growth is to evolve and improve our monetization. In the early days of streaming, we kept our pricing very simple with just one plan level. In 2014, we introduced three price tiers to better segment demand. Going forward, we will focus on better monetizing usage through both continued optimization of our pricing and tiering structures as well as the addition of a new, lower-priced ad-supported tier. Advertising Our lower priced advertising-supported offering will complementour existing plans, which will remain ad-free. Our global ARM has grown at a 5% compoundannual rate from 2013 to 2021, so it makes sense now to give consumers a choice for a lower priced option with advertisements, if they desire it. We recentlyannouncedMicrosoft as our technologyand sales partner and we’re targeting to launch this tier around the early part of 2023. They are investing heavily to expand their multi-billion advertising business into premium television video, and we are thrilled to be working with such a strong global partner. We’re excited by the opportunity given the combination of our very engaged audience and high quality content, which we think will attract premium CPMs from brand advertisers. We’ll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant. Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So, our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one. Over time, our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that’s more seamless and relevant for consumers, and more effective for our advertising partners. While it will take some time to grow our member base for the ad tier and the associated ad revenues, over the long run, we think advertising can enable substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth (through ad revenues). Paid Sharing We’re in the early stages of working to monetize the 100m+ households that are currently enjoying, but not directly paying for, Netflix. We know this will be a change for our members. As such, we have launchedtwo different approachesin Latin Americato learn more. Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023. We’re encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America. 6Simplicity At Netflix, focus remains very important to us. These initiatives - paid sharing and advertising - do introduce some additional complexity, but our approach has always been tokeep our business model as simple as possible within the context of our growth objectives. In this vein, these initiatives are similar to expanding into originals, launching our service across the world, and building our own studio, each of which also increased complexity but are natural extensions intended to enhance our existing business. F/X Neutral Operating Margin Disclosure To provide additional transparency around our operating margin, we’ll now disclose our year-to-date (YTD) operating margin based on F/X ratesat the beginningof each year. This will allow investors to see how our operating margin is tracking against our target (which was set in January of 2022 based on F/X rates at that time), absent intra-year fluctuations in F/X (which have beensubstantial in 2022). As can be seen from the table below, F/X-driven changes to our revenue have a high flow through to operating income (the operating profit impact ranges from ~75% to 80%+ of the revenue impact). This is because the bulk of our expenses don’t change with F/X fluctuations.  Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year. YTD 2022 through June 30, 2022. Note: There were no adjustments to content amortization for the purposes of this calculation, as titles are amortized at the historical blended rate at the time of capitalization. 7Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was +$103 million vs. -$64 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)3in the quarter totaled+$13 million, compared with -$175 million in Q2’21. Cash declined $190m sequentially, primarily due to our Next Games acquisition ($69m) and the F/X impact on cash ($145m). As we’ve discussed previously, we are now self-funding. For the full year 2022, we expect FCF to be approximately +$1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars (assuming no material further movements in F/X). We expect annual positive FCF going forward (with substantial growth in FCF in 2023 vs. 2022) due to our increasing revenue, solid profitability, and the successful multi-year evolution of our content model. We’re now more than a decade into transforming our service from licensed second run content to mostly Netflix originals - including more than five years into building out our internal studio to produce the majority of our original titles (60% of our net content assets on our balance sheet are Netflix-produced). We’re now through the most cash-intensive part of that transition. As a result, our cash content spend-to-content amortization expense ratio peaked at 1.6x (along with peak negative FCF of -$3.3B in 2019) and is expected to be about 1.2-1.3x in 2022 and to decline going forward, based on our current plans, which assume no material expansion into new content categories in ‘23. 2022 estimate based on the midpoint of 1.2x-1.3x range. 3For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 8Gross debt at quarter end amounted to $14.3 billion, within our targeted range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $5.8 billion, net debt totaled $8.5 billion, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA4. Our capital structure policy remains unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (eg, about $5.3 billion based on Q2 revenue). After meeting those needs, our intent is to return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) At this year’s annual meeting in June, shareholders approved proposals to declassify our board, remove supermajority voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings. We’ve also changed the voting standard for our directors to simple majority in uncontested elections. Our governance structure is now similar to other large cap company governance structures. With more than one billion people living with some form of disability, we want to ensure Netflix is as accessible as possible. In Q2, we announced that we are expanding the availability of audio descriptions and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing to a total of 20 languages - work that recently won the prestigiousDr. Jacob Bolotin Award. We’ve also introducednew badges for our titles that have audio descriptions and subtitles on laptop and iOS, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first. Summary Reaccelerating our revenue growth is a big challenge. But we’ve been through hard times before. We’ve built this company to be flexible and adaptable and this will be a great test for us and our high performance culture. We’re fortunate to be in a position of strength as the leader in streaming entertainment by all metrics (revenue, engagement, subscribers, profit and free cash flow). We’re confident and optimistic about the future.

       "  \"In Q3, we grew to $5.2 billion in revenue, up 31% over the prior year, and operating income doubled to $1.0 billion. Paid net adds totaled 6.8m compared to our 7.0m forecast and prior year Q3 of 6.1m. As we’ve improved the variety, diversity and quality of our content slate, member engagement has grown, revenue has increased, and we’re able to further fund our content investment. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast In Q3’19, average streaming paid memberships and ARPU grew 22% and 9% year over year, respectively. Excluding a -$137m year over year impact from F/X, consolidated revenue growth was 35%, while streaming ARPU growth was 12%. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above our guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4’19. EPS amounted to $1.47 vs. $0.89 and included a $171 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Our Euro bonds provide us with a small natural hedge for our growing European revenues. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, our guidance forecast was our most accurate in recent history. 1In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. On a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a meaningful impact on paid net adds. However, revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. With more revenue, we’ll continue to invest to improve our service to further strengthen our value proposition. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We’re making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress. For Q4, we’re expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We’re forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. As we outline in more detail below, our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. 2We’re on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we’ll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we’ve delivered each year since 2017. As we’ve said previously, large swings in F/X could lead to some variations from our steady annual margin progression, partially because we don’t buy derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars. Content We strive to program Netflix with the best variety of high quality content across many genres (scripted series, films, docs, comedy specials, unscripted TV, kids & family, anime, etc.). Our ambitious approach reflects our goal to satisfy the entertainment desires of our 158m-plus members and to attract as many of the hundreds of millions of non-members as we can. To accomplish this, we need great breadth of quality content because people have very diverse tastes. If you think about your own habits, you’ll recognize that what you want to watch on a Friday night may differ from what you want to watch on Tuesday after a long day of work or what you want to watch with your family on Saturday morning or what you want to watch with your friends on Sunday afternoon. Now, multiply that by the billions of people on the planet and all the other factors that affect viewing preferences and you will have a sense of the breadth of programming necessary to be as successful as we desire. We have been moving increasingly to original content both because of the anticipated pullback of second run content from some studios and because our original content is working in the form of member viewing and engagement. We started first with English scripted TV series more than six years ago to great success. We continued in Q3 with Stranger Things Season 3 (the most watched season to \\u200b \\u200b date with 64m member households in its first four weeks). We also introduced new limited series like 3Unbelievable, one of our most thought provoking and highly viewed dramas (watched by 32m member \\u200b households in its first 28 days). We’re expanding our non-English language original offerings because they continue to help grow our penetration in international markets. In Q3, Season 3 of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist) became the \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b most watched show on Netflix across our non-English language territories with 44m households watching the new season in the first four weeks of release. Sintonia, our latest Brazilian original, was the \\u200b \\u200b second most watched inaugural season in Brazil. The Naked Director broke out as the biggest title launch \\u200b \\u200b for us in Japan and was also highly successful throughout Asia. Similarly, in India, we debuted the second season of Sacred Games, our most watched show in India. To date, we have globally released 100 \\u200b \\u200b seasons of local language, original scripted series from 17 countries and have plans for over 130 more in 2020. We also plan to expand our investment in local language original films and unscripted series. We’re also investing aggressively in original films and making great progress with improving results. Our original film slate in Q3 featured several solid hits like Secret Obsession (starring Brenda Song) and \\u200b \\u200b Otherhood (directed by Cindy Chupack in her feature directorial debut), which were watched by 40 \\u200b million and 29 million households in their first four weeks, respectively. Tall Girl, a new family film \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b starring Ava Michelle, was also a success with 41m households watching in the first 28 days. We expect that our Q4 film releases will continue to build and strengthen our film effort. Q4 film releases include Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman (with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci), Marriage Story (starring \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and The Two Popes (featuring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan \\u200b \\u200b Pryce), all of which have emerged as early Oscar frontrunners. We also have several big releases such as Dolemite is My Name (starring Eddie Murphy and featuring a breakout performance from Da'Vine Joy \\u200b \\u200b Randolph), 6 Underground (directed by Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds), The Laundromat, from \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b director Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman and The King (starring Timothée \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton) as well as animated features Klaus and I Lost My Body. \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Our goal is to have the quality of our slate rival the ambition of its scope. An example is Orange is the \\u200b New Black, which wrapped its final new season in Q3. The show was celebrated by fans and the media \\u200b for the groundbreaking role it played for Netflix and the culture at large; Time Magazine said “...’Orange is the New Black’ is the most important TV show of the decade.” Our very popular Ozark, \\u200b \\u200b Our Planet, Queer Eye, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and When They See Us led 40 Netflix original series \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and films to a record 117 Emmy Nominations and 27 wins in 2019. With so many firms now looking to provide premium video content to consumers, it’s a great time to be a creator of content. Amazing content can be expensive. We don’t shy away from taking bold swings if we think the business impact will also be amazing. We don’t close every deal we chase and we don’t chase every deal on the table. And while not all projects that we do pursue will work out, our large and growing subscription base helps enable us to try many approaches, while the size of our content budget (~$10 billion on P&L spend and ~$15 billion in cash content spend in 2019) insulates us from dependency on any single title. We’ll continue to learn as we go, while staying disciplined by assessing each opportunity individually, steadily marching up our operating margin and improving free cash flow. 4Product and Partnerships We seek to make it easier for future members to sign up and enjoy Netflix. To that end, we rolled out a lower priced mobile plan in India in July and we’re pleased with the results. Our approach with pricing is to grow revenue and so far, uptake and retention on our mobile plan in India has been better than our initial testing suggested. This will allow us to invest more in Indian content to further satisfy our members. While still only a very small percentage of our total subscriber base, we’re continuing to test mobile-only plans in other markets. We continued to expand our partner-based bundle offerings, adding bundles with Sky Italia, Canal+ in France, KDDI in Japan and Izzi in Mexico this quarter. We just localized our service in Vietnamese, Hungarian and Czech so that more entertainment fans can enjoy thousands of hours of TV shows and films in their preferred language. We’ll continue to expand language coverage and accessibility. Competition We compete broadly for entertainment time. This means there are many competitive activities to Netflix (from watching linear TV to playing video games, for example). But there is also a very large market opportunity; today we believe we’re less than 10% of TV screen time in the US (our most mature market) and much less than that in mobile screen time. Many are focused on the “streaming wars,” but we’ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade. The upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV. While the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world. The launch of these new services will be noisy. There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we’ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. By way of example, our growth in Canada, where Hulu does not exist, is nearly identical to our growth in the US (where Hulu is very successful at about 30 million paid memberships). Our penetration in both markets below: 5We believe this is due to the big factor of streaming growing into linear TV plus the fact that streaming video services have mostly exclusive content libraries that make them highly differentiated from one another. In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and Discovery didn’t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience share from broadcast viewing. Content creation is booming around the world and everyone is vying for consumer attention. Over the next 10 years, many streaming services will grow viewing as streaming replaces linear TV. Our focus will continue to be on pleasing our members and growing engagement because that approach has served us well since 1997. Total viewing, as measured by various 3rd parties, is the best indicator of our relative success since it’s a signal of customer satisfaction, and few of the services will disclose streaming video revenue, and subscriber figures are hard to interpret (given bundles, discounts and other promotions). Our focused approach to date has driven meaningful growth in our membership base and engagement. We did well during the first decade of streaming. We’ve been preparing for this new wave of competition for a long time. It’s why we started investing in originals in 2012 and expanded aggressively ever since - across programming categories and countries with an ambition to share stories from the world to the world. In Q4, with The Crown, The Witcher, Klaus, The Irishman, The Two Popes, 6 \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Underground, and many other amazing titles launching, we’re ready to compete to earn consumers’ \\u200b attention and viewing. 6Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q3’19 was -$502 million vs. -$690 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 in Q3 totaled -$551 million vs. -$859 million in Q3’18. For the full year 2019, we’re still expecting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we’re expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. As we move slowly toward FCF positive, our plan is to continue to use the high yield market in the interim to finance our investment needs. Next Year Reporting Starting with our Q4’19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region, which is how we think about our business. Our four regions are Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM), and the US and Canada (UCAN). UCAN is roughly 90% US and 10% Canada. Under this new reporting format, we’ll only provide membership guidance for global paid memberships for the next quarter with each earnings report. \\u200b As we self-produce and license more original content that has global rights, we are finding US vs. international segment contribution margin reporting is becoming less useful internally. We’ll stop reporting on it in January 2020 and continue to focus on global operating margin as our primary profitability metric. As a reminder, we’ll no longer report free trial members beginning in 2020 as we informed you in our Q3’18 investor letter. \\u200b \\u200b 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 7Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: July 2019, April 2019, January 2019, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b October 2018, July 2018, April 2018, January 2018, October 2017. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b October 16, 2019 Earnings Interview, 3pm PDT Our video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm \\u200b \\u200b PDT today.

IR Contact: PR Contact: Spencer Wang Richard Siklos VP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development VP, Communications 408 809-5360 408 540-2629 Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated 8that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       "  \"As we expected, growth has slowed with 2.2m paid net adds in Q3 vs. 6.8m in Q3’19. We think this is primarily due to our record first half results and the pull-forward effect we described in our April and July letters. In the first nine months of 2020, we added 28.1m paid memberships, which exceeds the 27.8m that we added for all of 2019. In these challenging times, we’re dedicated to serving our members. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Q3 average streaming paid memberships rose 25%, while streaming ARPU decreased 1.6% year over year. Excluding a foreign exchange (F/X) impact of -$158m, streaming ARPU increased 1% vs. prior year. Revenue was 2% above our beginning-of-quarter guidance primarily due to slightly higher than expected ARPU (favorable plan mix in our UCAN, LATAM and APAC regions plus intra-quarter appreciation in the Euro and British pound which helped lift EMEA ARPU). As a result, operating margin of 20% (up 170bps year over year) exceeded our guidance forecast as well. EPS of $1.74 vs. $1.47 a year ago included a $249m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which accounted for the variance with our EPS guidance. We added 2.2m net memberships in Q3, compared with our 2.5m guidance. Retention remains healthy and engagement per member household was up solidly year over year in Q3’20. As a reminder, our 1guidance is our internal forecast and we strive for accuracy. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and, in others, it will be low. Our APAC region was the largest contributor to our paid membership growth this quarter (46% of Q3 global paid net adds) and APAC revenue rose 66% year over year. We’re pleased with the progress we’re making in this region and, in particular, that we’ve achieved double digit penetration of broadband homes in both South Korea and Japan. While this is encouraging, we still have much work to do and we're working hard to replicate this success in India and other countries. For Q4‘20, we forecast 6.0m paid net adds vs 8.8m in Q4‘19. As we have highlighted in our recent investor letters, we believe our record first half paid net additions would result in slower growth in the back half of this year. If we achieve our forecast, it will put us at a record 34m paid net adds for 2020, well above our prior annual high of 28.6m in 2018. The state of the pandemic and its impact continues to make projections very uncertain, but as the world hopefully recovers in 2021, we would expect that our growth will revert back to levels similar to pre-COVID. In turn, we expect paid net adds are likely to be down year over year in the first half of 2021 as compared to the big spike in paid net adds we experienced in the first half of 2020. We continue to view quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not that meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment, which we believe is still early and should provide us with many years of strong future growth as we continue to improve our service. 2We forecast Q4 operating margin of 13.5% vs. 8.4% last year, which means we’ll over-deliver this year on our original full year margin target; our FY20 operating margin is now expected to be 18% (vs. 16% originally) or a 500 basis point increase year over year. Since 2016, we will have more than quadrupled our annual GAAP operating margin (which is our primary profitability metric). As in the past, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year and at an average rate of 300 basis points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate more lumpiness. Some years we’ll be a little over (like this year when we expect to grow operating margin 500bps), some years a little under, but we are trying to keep on a 300 bps per year long-term trajectory. The increased lumpiness is due to increased F/X exposure from our international success and COVID’s impact on the timing of spending. By moving to this multi-year model, we’ll be able to manage our short term expenses more smoothly as well as grow slightly more efficiently than in the past. As we wrote last quarter, for 2021, we’re targeting a 19% operating margin. Content We are making good and careful progress returning to production, particularly in EMEA and APAC, but also across much of LATAM and UCAN. We’ve restarted production on some of our biggest titles including season four of Stranger Things, action film Red Notice (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and Ryan Reynolds) and The Witcher season two. Since the almost-global shutdown of production back \\u200b \\u200b in mid-March, we have already completed principal photography on 50+ productions and, while the course and impact of C-19 remains unpredictable, we’re optimistic we will complete shooting on over 150 other productions by year-end. For our 2021 slate, we continue to expect the number of Netflix originals launched on our service to be up year over year in each quarter of 2021 and we’re confident that we’ll have an exciting range of programming for our members, particularly relative to other entertainment service options. As 3discussed last quarter, some of our most popular returning titles are expected to launch in the second half of next year. This past quarter, the breadth of our programming was demonstrated with standout titles across many genres. In English language series, we debuted new seasons of The Umbrella Academy and Lucifer; 43m \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and 38m member households chose to watch these titles in the first 28 days, respectively. In mid-September, we also premiered Ryan Murphy’s Ratched, a thriller based on the character from One \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. In its first four weeks, 48m member households chose to watch Ratched. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Our #1 and #2 most watched documentary feature films ever were released in Q3. American Murder: \\u200b The Family Next Door is projected to have 52m members households choose the title in its first 28 days \\u200b and The Social Dilemma had 38m in its first 28 days. \\u200b \\u200b We continue to invest heavily in local language content because we believe that great stories are universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Season one of the Mexican telenovela Oscuro Deseo (Dark Desire) was our biggest local language original globally this quarter. Our \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b slate of Korean dramas continue to travel well throughout APAC and beyond, while anime is another category of content with fans all over the world. Another example of our content traveling around the globe is our non-fiction series Indian \\u200b Matchmaking, which was watched by a quarter of our members in India and millions of members \\u200b outside of India in its first four weeks. Original film continues to be an area of opportunity for us and we had several big hits in Q3. Action thriller The Old Guard (starring Charlize Theron and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood) was our most \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b popular title of the quarter with 78m member households choosing to watch in its first four weeks. Our romantic comedy The Kissing Booth 2 received strong reception (66m member households chose to \\u200b \\u200b watch in the first 28 days), while action film Project Power (starring Jamie Foxx) was also very popular \\u200b \\u200b (75m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks). Late in September, we debuted Enola \\u200b Holmes, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill as her famed detective brother. We estimate 76m \\u200b member households will have chosen this film in the first 28 days. Our content successes highlight our ability to tap into our global audience of nearly 200m members and underscore the notion that content is discovered on Netflix. This applies not only to Netflix originals, but \\u200b \\u200b also to second run programming, like Schitt’s Creek and earlier seasons of Lucifer, both of which are very \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b popular with our members. The latest example is Cobra Kai (based on The Karate Kid films), which \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b originally debuted on YouTube’s subscription service in May 2018 and recently launched on Netflix on August 28. In its first four weeks of release on Netflix, 50m member households chose to watch season one, dramatically expanding its audience. We’re looking forward to season 3 of Cobra Kai premiering exclusively on Netflix on January 8, 2021. In \\u200b \\u200b addition to the recently released The Haunting of Bly Manor (a follow up to the acclaimed The Haunting \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b of Hill House), season one of Emily in Paris and Adam Sandler’s latest film Hubie Halloween, other \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b notable Q4 titles include our animated family film Over the Moon from legendary creator Glen Keane \\u200b \\u200b (premiering this weekend), season four of our award-winning series The Crown and the first season of \\u200b \\u200b Selena. We’ll also have a great slate of films, including The Midnight Sky (directed by and starring George \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 4Clooney), Hillbilly Elegy (from Ron Howard), Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom (with Viola Davis and Chadwick \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Boseman), The Christmas Chronicles 2 (from Chris Columbus), Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey (with \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Forest Whitaker), MANK (David Fincher’s first feature at Netflix) and Ryan Murphy’s The Prom (starring \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden and Kerry Washington). Product and Partnerships We strive to be a global entertainment service that can satisfy the needs of members all over the world. Commissioning and producing local language content is an important part of that. But we also invest heavily into improving our product, partnerships and overall consumer experience. For example, in India in Q3, we localized our service to support Hindi in our user interface. We’re also working with local partners like Reliance Jio, India’s largest mobile operator, where in Q3 we launched a bundle with their mobile and fiber broadband plans. As part of this broad partnership, we’ll integrate Netflix with two of Jio’s set top boxes. We’ve also partnered with financial institutions in India to make payment processing easier and more seamless for our members, which we expect will have retention benefits. All of these initiatives are important and work in concert with our big investment in local originals to improve the Netflix experience for our members. Competition Competition for consumers’ time and engagement remains vibrant. Linear television and other big categories of entertainment, like video games and user generated content from YouTube and TikTok are all vying for consumers’ attention and are strong drivers of screen time usage. We remain quite small relative to overall screen time. This past quarter, we saw the debut of Comcast’s Peacock, which comes on the heels of the launch of HBO Max and Disney+. Disney’s recent management reorganization signals that it is embracing the shift to streaming entertainment. We’re thrilled to be competing with Disney and a growing number of other 5players to entertain people; both consumers and content creators will benefit from our mutual desire to bring the best stories to audiences all over the world. We’ll continue to focus on pleasing our members and improving our service as quickly as possible so that we can be everyone's first choice for online entertainment. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was +$1.3 billion vs. -$502 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)1 was positive for a third consecutive quarter at +$1.1b vs. -$551 million in Q3‘19. Year to date free cash flow is +$2.2 billion vs. -$1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2019. As productions increasingly restart, we expect Q4’20 FCF to be slightly negative and therefore, for the full year 2020, we forecast FCF to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of break-even to positive. This change is due primarily to our higher operating margin expectation for 2020 and the timing of cash spending on content. We expect our FCF profile over the coming years to continue to improve as we increase our profitability and our transition to the production of Netflix originals (which requires more cash upfront vs. second run content) matures. For 2021, we currently expect free cash flow to be -$1 billion to break-even. With $8.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter plus our $750m credit facility (which is undrawn), our need for external financing is diminishing. As indicated last quarter, we don’t have plans to access the capital markets this year.

       "  'After a lighter-than-normal content slate in Q1 and Q2 due to COVID-related production delays in 2020, we are seeing the positive effects of a stronger slate in the second half of the year. In Q3, we grew revenue 16% year over year to $7.5 billion, while operating income rose 33% vs. the prior year quarter to $1.8 billion. We added 4.4m paid net adds (vs. 2.2m in Q3’20) to end the quarter with 214m paid memberships. We’re very excited to finish the year with what we expect to be our strongest Q4 content offering yet, which shows up as bigger content expense and lower operating margins sequentially. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 9% and 7% increase in average paid streaming memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding a foreign exchange (FX)impact of +$128m, ARM rose 5% year over year. Operating margin for Q3 amounted to 23.5%, a three percentage point increase vs. the year ago period. This was above our beginning of quarter forecast due to the timing of content spend, as well as lower than forecasted marketing spend. EPS of $3.19 vs. $1.74 a year ago included a $136m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We under-forecasted paid net adds for the quarter (4.4m actual vs. our 3.5m projection), while ending paid memberships of 214m was within 0.4% of our forecast. For the second consecutive quarter, the APAC region was our largest contributor to membership growth with 2.2m paid net adds (half of total paid net adds) as we are continuing to improve our service in this region. In EMEA, paid net adds of 1.8m improved sequentially vs. the 188k in Q2 as several titles had a particularly strong impact. The UCAN and 1ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1LATAM regions grew paid memberships more slowly. These regions have higher penetration of broadband homes although we believe we still have ample runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q4’21, we forecast paid net adds of 8.5m, consistent with Q4’20 paid net additions. For the full year 2021, we forecast an operating margin of 20% or slightly better. This means that Q4’21 operating margin will be approximately 6.5% compared with 14% in Q4’20. The year over year decline in operating margin is due mostly to our backloaded big content release schedule in this Q4, which will result in a roughly 19% year over year increase in content amortization for Q4’21 (compared with ~8% growth year to date). Content Our programming strategy is to provide members with a wide variety of high quality content that’s loved and watched in large numbers. Season five ofLa Casade Papel(akaMoney Heist) and season three of Sex Educationwere two of our biggest returning showsin the quarter with 69m and 55m member households, respectively, choosing to watch these fan favorites in the first four weeks. On the heels of The Queen’s Gambit, we’ve had another limited serieshit withMaidwhich launched just after quarter-end on October 1. We expect this story about living on the poverty line by award-winning playwright and screenwriter Molly Smith Metzler to reach 67m households during its first four weeks. La Casa de Papelwas our first non-English languagetitle to show that - with subtitling and dubbing - great stories truly can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world. While the goal of our local content executives is always to create locally authentic stories that will resonate in their country (likeThe Chestnut Manwhich we expect to be watched by 2approximately two thirds of our Danish members during its first four weeks), Netflix is a global, direct-to-consumer service which enables creators to reach broader audiences - and gives our members an even greater choice of stories to enjoy. There is no better example of this thanSquid Game,a unique Korean story that first captured the zeitgeist in Korea and then globally. Released on September 17, it has becomeour biggest TV show ever. A mind-boggling142mmember households globally havechosen to watch the title in its first four weeks. The breadth ofSquid Game’s popularity is truly amazing;this show has been ranked as our #1 program in 94 countries (including the US). Like some of our other big hits,Squid Gamehas also pierced the cultural zeitgeist, spawning aSaturday Night Liveskitandmemes/clips on TikTokwith more than 42 billion views. Demand for consumer products to celebrate the fandom forSquid Gameis high and those items are on their way to retail now. Our film slate also continues to build with a variety of successful Q3 titles such as action filmSweetGirl starring Jason Momoa (68m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks),Kissing Booth 3 (59m), the last installment in the rom com trilogy, the animated family filmVivo(46m) andBlood Red Sky, a German-language action horror movie (53m). Later in the year, we will shift to reporting on hours viewed for our titles rather than the number of accounts that choose to watch them. There is some difference in rankings, as you see below, but we think engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction. It also matches how outside services measure TV viewing and gives proper credit to rewatching. In addition, we will start to release title metrics more regularly outside of our earnings report so our members and the industry can better measure success in the streaming world. 3* Total hours viewed per title in its first 28 days on Netflix. ** The number of accounts that have watched at least two minutes of that title in its first 28 days on Netflix. Data as of 9/27/21. We’re honored to have garnered the most Emmys ever for any single network or service in a season of television, with 44 (tying CBS’ tally in 1974 when there were only three national networks). This included our first best Drama series win (The Crown), whileThe Queen’s Gambitwon 11 out of 18 nominations, including the coveted best limited series. Both titles are among our most popular ever, demonstrating critical and commercial success. During Q3, we announced our agreement to acquire theRoald Dahl Story Company, pending regulatory approval. This was an opportunity to purchase a beloved and enduring portfolio of intellectual property includingCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,Matilda,The BFG,James and the Giant Peach,Fantastic Mr. FoxandThe Twits, to name just a few. Roald Dahl’sbooks have been translated into 63 languages and have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. Once we close, we’ll be looking to develop even more of these stories into new formats across the live action television and films, animation and pre-school categories. We’ve begun testing our games offering in select countries. It remains very early days for this initiative and, like other content categories we’ve expanded into, we plan to try different types of games, learn from our members and improve our game library. During Q3, we acquiredNight School Studio, the maker of critically acclaimed games likeOXENFREE,to help build out our game development capabilities. 4As a reminder, games on Netflix will be included in members’ subscriptions and will not have advertisements or in-app purchases so game play is purely focused on enjoyment versus monetization. We’re eagerly anticipating the rest of our Q4 slate, which includes a great mix of popular returning English language series likeThe Witcher,You, TigerKingandCobra Kai, big returning non-English series likeSintoniaand the final chapter ofLa Casa dePapel(akaMoney Heist), as well as exciting new movies such as the action filmRed Notice(starring DwayneJohnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds),Don’t Look Upwith an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio,Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep, as well asThe Harder They FallfeaturingJonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, LaKeith Stanfield, Regina King and Idris Elba,Army of Thieves(the prequel to ourhit movie,Army of the Dead) andThe UnforgivablestarringSandra Bullock, Viola Davis and Jon Bernthal. The latest films from acclaimed directors Jane Campion (The Power Of The Dog) and Paolo Sorrentino (The Hand of God) are also coming to Netflix in Q4. Assuming no new Covid waves or unforeseen events that result in large scale production shutdowns, we currently anticipate a more normalized content slate in 2022, with a greater number of originals in 2022 vs. 2021 and a release schedule that is more balanced over the course of the year, as compared to 2021. Product We try many different approaches to see what might help our growth. One example in Q3 was the launch of a free plan for mobile users in Kenya. This plan is a great way for anyone in Kenya with an Android mobile phone to explore Netflix - with access to great content, personalized recommendations, and parental controls. We hope that this encourages more people to sign up for a paid membership so that they can watch Netflix on any device (mobile, TV, or laptop), access more features (e.g. downloads) and enjoy our entire catalog. It will take a year or two to determine if this technique helps our paid membership growth or not. We know that members most value the variety and quality of our content. Great recommendations are key to ensuring they can experience that breadth and diversity. So we continue to invest in our recommendations to ensure members can easily find great stories to enjoy on our service. One example of our ability to surface relevant programming isManifest, a TV series that aired on NBC for three seasons and was subsequently cancelled in June 2021. We addedManifestto our service in the US and Canada during the summer of 2021. In the UCAN region, 25m member households chose to watch this title in its first 28 days and we’ve ordered a fourth and final season given the popularity of the show. Marketing & Communications In addition to having best in class content and a product experience that allows members to easily find shows and movies they love, we also want our programming to be talked about and in the cultural zeitgeist. In September, we held our first global fan event,TUDUM, which featured news, first looksand trailers from over 100 of the most anticipated Netflix films and series of the next 12 months. TUDUM was a new way for us to connect fans with our titles, talent and brand and to drive conversation at a global scale and trended at #2 globally the day of the event on Twitter. Additionally, TUDUM and the 5trailers/content released following the event were watched by fans in over 180 countries, generating close to 700m views and more than 3 billion impressions in less than four days. Competition We compete with a staggeringly large set of activities for consumers’ time and attention like watching linear TV, reading a book, browsing TikTok, or playing Fortnite, to name just a few. As one example of this dynamic, on October 4, when Facebook experienced a global outage for several hours, our engagement saw a 14% increase during this time period. We are still quite small, with a lot of opportunity for growth; in our largest and most penetrated market, according to Nielsen, we are still less than 10% of US television screen time. Our approach as always is to improve our service as quickly as we can so that we can earn a greater share of people’s time. Share of Total US TV Time, September 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $82 million vs. $1.3 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was-$106 million vs. $1.1 billion in Q3‘20. FCF in last year’s Q3 was helped by COVID-related production shutdowns. Year to date FCF is $410m. With production volume ramping successfully and a lower operating margin in Q4, we anticipate Q4 ‘21 FCF to be negative. We continue to expect full year 2021 FCF to be approximately breakeven (plus or minus several hundred million dollars depending on the timing of production starts and related cash spending on content). We anticipate being FCF positive on an annual basis in 2022 and beyond. 2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6As we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repurchased 0.2m shares for $100 million. Our slower buyback pace this quarter reflects the pick up in our M&A activity. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above and beyond our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In March, we committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022 and to reduce our emissions to be in line with the latest climate science, ensuring that our internal reductions are consistent with a trajectory of no more than 1.5℃ of warming. We’ve been making progress on this initiative. We provided an update in Septemberhere.

       "  \"Summary:  Revenue, operating income and membership slightly exceeded our forecast in Q3’22.  We had big hits across TV and film in Q3 – launching some of our most watched series and films of all time, including:  Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,Stranger ThingsS4,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, The Gray Man, andPurple Hearts  Our lower priced ad-supported plan launches in 12 countries in November – just six months after our initial announcement. Our existing plans remain ad free.  Netflix has higher engagement than any other streamer – with room for growth:  In the UK, Netflix accounts for 8.2% of video viewing, 2.3x Amazon and 2.7x Disney+1;  In the US, Netflix accounts for 7.6% of TV time, 2.6x Amazon and 1.4x Disney + Hulu + Hulu Live2.  Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix's $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit. After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth. The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us. 1Based on reporting fromBARB, as of September 2022 2Based onNielsen’s Gauge, as of August 2022 Q3 Results Our 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 5% increase in average paid memberships and a 1% rise in ARM3. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), revenue and ARM grew 13% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. The sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to F/X. We under-forecasted paid net additions, which totaled 2.4 million vs. our 1.0m forecast and compared to 4.4m in the year ago quarter.  In APAC, revenue grew 19% excluding F/X as average paid memberships rose 23% year-over-year. ARM was -3% year-over-year, excluding F/X, partially driven by lower ARM in India, somewhat offset by higher ARM in Australia and Korea. We added 1.4m paid memberships in the region (vs. 2.2m last Q3).  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM grew 13% and 7%, respectively. Paid net adds totaled 0.6m vs. 1.8m in the year ago quarter.  In LATAM, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, supported by ARM growth of 16% vs. the year ago quarter excluding F/X. We added 0.3m paid memberships, in-line with membership growth in Q3’21.  In UCAN, our most penetrated market, ARM and revenue grew by 12% and 11%, respectively, excluding F/X. Paid net adds totaled 0.1m (similar to the 0.1m in Q3’21). For Q3, operating income totaled $1.5 billion vs. $1.8 billion in Q3’21. Operating income was above our beginning-of-quarter forecast, partially due to higher revenue, as well as a shift in timing of some spend from Q3 to Q4. As a result, operating margin of 19% was above our 16% forecast. The four percentage point year-over-year decline in operating margin is almost entirely due to the appreciation in the US dollar vs. most other currencies during this period. EPS of $3.10 vs. $3.19 a year ago included a $348 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Q4 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. The appreciation of the US dollar remains a significant headwind for us (and US-based multinationals in general). For Q4’22, we’re expecting revenue of $7.8 billion with the sequential decline entirely due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar vs. other currencies. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Our revenue growth forecast is driven by our expectation for 4.5m paid net adds (vs. 8.3m in Q4’21) and ARM growth of 6% year-over-year, excluding F/X. Our paid net adds forecast assumes that we experience our usual seasonality as well as the impact of a strong content slate, counterbalanced by macroeconomic weakness which leads to less-than-normal visibility. While we’re very optimistic about our new advertising business, we don’t expect a material contribution in Q4’22 as we’re launching our Basic with Ads plan intra-quarter and anticipate growing our membership in that plan gradually over time. Our aim 3ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 2is to give our prospective new members more choice - not switch members off their current plans. Members who don’t want to change will remain on their current plan, without ads, at the current price. We forecast Q4’22 operating margin of 4% vs. 8% in the year ago period. The fourth quarter is typically our lowest operating margin quarter of the year as it’s usually our largest quarter in terms of content and marketing spend. In addition, the aforementioned F/X impact has a high flow through to operating income (~75%-80% of the revenue impact) as most of our costs are in US dollars. Excluding the year-over-year impact of F/X, our Q4’22 operating margin forecast would be 10% vs. 8% in Q4’21. TheUS dollar has strengthenedagainst most othercurrencies at a historic rate this year. Based on our YTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negatively impact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. As a reminder, our 2022 and 2023 operating margin target of 19%-20% is based on F/X rates in January 2022, as we discussed in ourQ4’21 letterand subsequentearnings calls. We’re on track to meet this F/X neutral operating margin objective for 2022 (excluding the $150m of restructuring costs in Q2) and for 2023. With the appreciation of the US dollar though, our reported operating margin would be lower than 19%-20% should the US dollar remain above January 2022 levels relative to other currencies. Over the medium term, we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. Our long term goal remains unchanged - to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating profit even faster (as we expand margins) and deliver growing positive free cash flow. Guidance Evolution As discussed in previous letters, we are increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top line metric. This will become particularly important heading into 2023 as we develop new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing, where membership is just one component of our revenue growth. So, 3starting with our Q4’22 letter in January of 2023, we’ll continue to provide guidance for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and fully diluted shares outstanding for the following quarter, but not paid membership. Similar to our regional membership disclosure, we’ll continue to report our global and regional membership each quarter as part of our earnings release. Content & Marketing We started our original programming strategy about a decade ago as we anticipated that some competitors would eventually stop licensing their content to Netflix. It’s been a huge challenge to build a lifetime of entertainment in just ten years in multiple languages and across so many different genres- series, films, animation, stand-up and non-fiction. And while we’ve had our share of misses, we’ve managed to create a very broad slate with many great series and films, for whatever your mood or tastes, from amazing storytellers around the world. Given everything we’ve learned, we’re confident we can deliver even more member value per content investment dollar over time. One of the best ways to understand the success of our content is by understanding our engagement. So we’re excited that BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board), the leading audience measurement and video ratings organization in the UK, is now reporting the share of video viewing for streaming services and broadcast groups in the UK on a monthly basis. In September, Netflix accounted for 8.2% of viewing, and we have more than 2x the monthly engagement of our next closest streaming competitor. This reporting is similar to Nielsen’s Gauge, which launched in May 2021 when Netflix accounted for 6% of viewing compared to 7.6% in August 2022. Our hope is that other measurement companies around the world will join Nielsen and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming and the viewing share of relevant entertainment companies. We think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles. This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love. As theGoogle Trends chartshows, the ability to watch all ofMonster: The Jeffrey DahmerStoryhelped drive significant interest in the show. 4It’s hard to imagine, for example, how a Korean title likeSquid Gamewould have become a mega hit globally without the momentum that came from people being able to binge it. We believe the ability for our members to immerse themselves in a story from start to finish increases their enjoyment but also their likelihood to tell their friends, which then means more people watch, join and stay with Netflix. Our Q3 content slate was especially strong. In English scripted TV, we kicked off the quarter with Stranger ThingsS4, which generated 1.35 billion hoursviewed4- our biggest season of an English language series ever. This was followed in August byThe Sandman(351 million hours viewed), which was loved by fans and critics alike. Near the end of the quarter, we launched season five of fan favoriteCobra Kai(270 million hours viewed) and limited seriesMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story*(824 million hours viewed) from Ryan Murphy, which is now our second largest English series. We continue to see great success with our non-English programming too, withSquid Gamemaking awards history by becoming the first foreign language title to win an Emmy - withsix awards, including for directing, production design and lead actor. Also from Korea,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, a unique series about an autistic lawyer, has reached #1 on our weekly non-English series list in 28 countries, notching up 402 million hours viewed and making it our sixth largest non-English TV show ever through 28 days.Narco-Saintshas been another huge K-Contentwin this quarter, with 128 million hours viewed since launch.Sintoniahas been a big hit for Netflixin Brazil, with season three generating 38 million hours viewed. And while it is still early days for German seriesThe Empress*, it launched with a very strong start (136 million hours viewed). Our goal is to create authentic local stories for members in the home territory, which we also make available globally. Film is incredibly important to our members. We expanded into original film in 2016 because producing our own movies across all budgets and genres has advantages over the next best alternative: only licensing from other studios in the first pay TV window (the “pay-one” window). Those advantages include first window availability on Netflix (pay-one movies debut generally well after theatrical release), global rights (pay-one movies are licensed by country), the ability to carry the films on Netflix in perpetuity (typically only for 18-24 months for pay-one films) and copyright ownership, enabling us to create derivatives like sequels and to use the intellectual property (IP) in games and consumer products. We continue to complement our original films with 3rd party licensed films - they remain an important and valued part of our service, but they are just one component of our broader programming strategy. We’re pleased with the progress of our original film initiative. The big budget action filmThe Gray Man (254 million hours viewed) reflects the scope of our ambition to create theatrical quality blockbusters that can reach huge audiences on Netflix: 118 million households (many of which are multi person) if you divide the total hours viewed by the film’s run time of 2 hours and 9 minutes. But since we’re not limited by the need to optimize for theatrical attendance, we can also produce a wider variety of films that consumers can enjoy. For example, the romantic dramaPurple Heartswas a hit among our members with 229 million hours viewed. We’re at an even earlier stage with animated feature films but in early Q3 we releasedThe Sea Beast(165 millionhours viewed), which is our biggest original animated 4Hours viewed data is based on viewing in the first 28 days of release for each episode. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through October 16, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10, whereyou can also find our detailed methodology. 5film to date. On the non-English language film side,Darlings(33 million hours viewed), starring Alia Bhatt, launched to rave reviews and huge fandom in India.Loving Adults(67 million hours viewed), a psychological thriller from Denmark, andCarter(65million hours viewed), a Korean blockbuster, were our two biggest non-English films of the quarter and are now our seventh and ninth most popular non-English films ever. We also continue to invest heavily in marketing, with a particular focus on innovative ways to drive conversation around our titles, which in turn boosts engagement for Netflix. For example, our campaigns for Stranger ThingsS4 andThe Gray Mandrove more than9.8 billion and 1.2 billion impressions, respectively, across paid marketing, social media platforms and events. And content forTudum, our global fan eventthat ran for its second year in September, generated almost1 billion views- up over 30% from last year. Beyond TV and movies, we’re coming up on the one year anniversary of our gaming launch. As we’ve said, this will be a multi-year journey for us to learn how to please game players. Our first year was about establishing our gaming infrastructure and understanding how our members interact with games. We now have 35 games on service (all included in every Netflix subscription without in-game ads or in-app purchases) and we’re seeing some encouraging signs of gameplay leading to higher retention. With 55 more games in development, including more games based on Netflix IP, we’re focused in the next few years on creating hit games that will take our game initiative to the next level. More generally, we see a big opportunity around content that crosses between TV or film and games. For example, after the launch of the animeCyberpunk: Edgerunners(49million hours viewed) in Q3use of CD Projekt’s game surgedon PCs. Product and Pricing As we’ve been discussing over the past few quarters, improving our pricing strategy is an important near-term focus. Last week, weannouncedthat we’llbe launching an ad-supported subscription plan on November 1 in Canada and Mexico; November 3 in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the US; and November 10 in Spain. Cumulatively, these 12 markets account for ~$140 billion of brand advertising spend across TV and streaming, or over 75% of the global market5. To start, we’re keeping it simple by offering one low-priced ad plan – Basic with Ads – at a price that’s 20%-40% below our current starting price. So in the US, for example, Netflix will now start at $6.99 per month (compared to $9.99 today). The Basic with Ads plan will have ~5 minutes of advertising per hour, frequency capping and strong privacy protections. The reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice, especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue and operating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue. Finally, we’ve landed on a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing and we’ll begin rolling this out more broadly starting in early 2023. After listening to consumer feedback, we are going to offer the 5Excluding China and Russia, where we don’t operate. 6ability for borrowers to transfer their Netflix profile into their own account, and for sharers to manage their devices more easily and to create sub-accounts (“extra member”), if they want to pay for family or friends. In countries with our lower-priced ad-supported plan, we expect the profile transfer option for borrowers to be especially popular. Competition As we’ve long said, we operate in a highly competitive industry, where people have many different entertainment choices – from linear TV to streaming, YouTube to TikTok and gaming to social media. The silver lining is that the opportunity is very large and growing, and Netflix is still very small relative to that opportunity (for example, ~8% of total TV time in the US and the UK, two of our most established countries). In the 190 countries in which we operate, our $30 billion-plus of annual revenue is roughly 5% of the combined estimated ~$300 billion pay TV/streaming industry, ~$180 billion branded advertising market, and $130 billion consumers spend annually on gaming6. So, we believe that we have a long runway for growth if we can continue to improve our offering steadily over time. As it’s become clear that streaming is the future of entertainment, our competitors – including media companies and tech players – are investing billions of dollars to scale their new services. But it's hard to build a large and profitable streaming business – our best estimate is that all of these competitors are losing money on streaming, with aggregate annual direct operating losses this year alone that could be well in excess of $10 billion, compared with our +$5-$6 billion of annual operating profit. For incumbent entertainment companies, this high level of investment is understandable given the accelerating decline of linear TV, which currently generates the bulk of their profit. Ultimately though, we believe some of our competitors will seek to build sustainable, profitable businesses in streaming - either on their own or through continued industry consolidation. While it’s early days, we’re starting to see this increased profit focus - with some raising prices for their streaming services, some reigning in content spending, and some retrenching around traditional operating models which may dilute their direct-to-consumer offering. Amidst this formidable, diverse set of competitors, we believe our focus as a pure-play streaming business is an advantage. Our aim remains to be the first choice in entertainment, and to continue to build an amazingly successful and profitable business. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $557 million vs. $82 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)7amounted to $472 million,compared with -$106 million in Q3’21. We continue to expect FCF of +$1 billion for the full year 2022, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars and substantial growth in FCF in 2023 (assuming no further material appreciation of the US dollar) . Gross debt at quarter end was $14 billion, within our $10-$15 billion target range. Cash increased $300 million sequentially to $6.1 billion. Net debt amounted to $7.9 billion at the end of Q3’22, or 1.2x LTM 6Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimatesand excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludes hardware sales. 7For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 7EBITDA. We have no debt maturities in 2023. In early October, we closed our previously announced acquisition of leading animation studio Animal Logic. We funded the transaction with cash, which will be reflected in our Q4’22 cash flow statement. There’s no change to our capital allocation approach. Our first priority is to continue to invest appropriately in our business for the long term, including new initiatives such as games and advertising, followed by selective acquisitions. After that, excess cash above our minimum cash levels (equivalent to roughly two months of revenue) will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.

       " ('FINAL-Q4-19-Shareholder-Letter',\n",
       "  'We had a strong finish to 2019, with Q4 revenue growing 31% year over year, bringing full year 2019 revenue to over $20 billion, while FY19 operating income rose 62% to $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we surpassed 100 million paid memberships outside of the US. Streaming entertainment is a global phenomenon and we’re working hard to build on our early progress. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast In Q4, average streaming paid memberships grew 21% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 9% year over year. Excluding a -$133 million impact from foreign currency, streaming ARPU rose 12% year over year. Operating income in Q4 amounted to $459m (vs. $216m last year). While this was slightly lower than our beginning-of-quarter forecast of $475m, we’re primarily managing by our full year operating margin target, which we met (13% in FY19 vs. 10% in FY18). EPS for Q4 amounted to $1.30 vs. $0.30 a year ago. During Q4, the US Treasury issued final regulations on certain aspects of the 2017 US tax reform. As a result, we had over-accrued in the first three quarters of 2019 for tax, which was adjusted in Q4, resulting in our net income being higher than operating \\u200b income this quarter. We paid US corporate taxes for the full year inclusive of this Q4 adjustment. 1Global paid net additions totaled 8.8m in Q4, on par with the 8.8m in the prior year period and ahead of our forecast of 7.6m, fueled by our broad slate of original programming and the worldwide adoption of streaming video. We generated Q4-record paid net adds in each of the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions, while UCAN paid net adds totaled 0.55m (with 0.42m in the US) vs. 1.75m in the year ago quarter. Our low membership growth in UCAN is probably due to our recent price changes and to US competitive launches. We have seen more muted impact from competitive launches outside the US (NL, CA, AU). As always, we are working hard to improve our service to combat these factors and push net adds higher over time. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1’20, we forecast global paid net adds of 7.0m vs. 9.6m in Q1’19, which was an all-time high in quarterly paid net adds. Our Q1’20 forecast reflects the continued, slightly elevated churn levels we are seeing in the US plus an expectation for more balanced paid net adds across Q1 and Q2 this year, with seasonality more similar to 2018 than 2019. This is due in part to the timing of last year’s price changes and a strong upcoming Q2 content slate, where we’ll have some of our bigger titles like La Casa De Papel \\u200b (aka Money Heist) season 4. \\u200b \\u200b We’re targeting a 16% operating margin in 2020 (up 300 basis points year over year). As a reminder, large swings in foreign exchange (F/X) could lead to some temporary variations from our annual margin progression, partially because we don’t spend on derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars. Content Great content grows engagement among our members, which we believe drives word-of-mouth, improves retention and grows paid memberships. We have many exciting releases for Q1’20 including 2returning seasons of Sex Education, Altered Carbon, Narcos: Mexico, the Spanish series Elite and Korean \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b historical zombie thriller Kingdom, as well as action film Spenser Confidential (starring Mark Wahlberg) \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and the movie sequel To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You. New original series include the recently \\u200b \\u200b released Messiah and the buzzy docu-series Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez and the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b upcoming I Am Not Okay with This. \\u200b These titles build off of a highly successful Q4 content slate, which included new seasons of The Crown, \\u200b Big Mouth and You and new series and films like Rhythm & Flow, American Son, Turkish series The Gift \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b and French film Banlieusards (aka Street Flow). The psychological thriller You, which originated on US \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b linear TV with a modest audience, has evolved into a global phenomenon on Netflix; we estimate, based on the first few weeks, 54m member households will choose to watch season 2 in its first 4 weeks. In its first four weeks, over 21m member households have chosen to watch season 3 of The Crown (up over \\u200b \\u200b 40% from Season 2 over the same time period) and in total, over 73m households worldwide have chosen The Crown since the series launched. The Crown and the all new Season 3 cast just won the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama series and star Olivia Colman won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series. During December, we also launched The Witcher, which is tracking to be our biggest season one TV \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b series ever. Through its first four weeks of release, 76m member households chose to watch this \\u200b action-packed fantasy, starring Henry Cavill. As a testament to how our hit content can penetrate the global zeitgeist and influence popular culture, the show’s launch drove up sales of The Witcher books \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b and games around the world, and spawned a viral musical hit. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Our Q4 movie slate set a new bar for the variety and high quality of films we produce to appeal to our members’ many different tastes. We released 6 Underground, from director Michael Bay and starring \\u200b \\u200b Ryan Reynolds, and 83m member households chose this crowd-pleasing action film through its first four weeks. The exceptional breadth and quality of our film slate was recognized as we led all studios with 24 Academy Award nominations across eight different films. The nominated feature films produced by the Netflix studio like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes were also very popular with our \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b members. Having launched our original film initiative just under five years ago, this is a proud achievement and a testament to the creative talent with whom we partner. \\u200b Across both film and TV, we were also recognized for being the home for storytellers and creators from many diverse backgrounds. We’re honored to lead the industry in nominations at both the NAACP Image \\u200b Awards (42 nominations) and the GLAAD Media Awards (15 nominations). \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b We know that local audiences love local stories. In fact, local originals were the most popular 2019 titles in many countries, including India, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Thailand, Sweden and the UK. In addition, we\\'ve seen how members all around the world also love these stories with La Casa de Papel/Money \\u200b Heist appearing on our top ten lists in more than 70 countries. K-content is also popular globally, and \\u200b we\\'re investing heavily in Korean stories. In this past quarter, we inked a TV output deal with JTBC, a leading Korean media company, and a strategic partnership with CJ ENM’s Studio Dragon, Korea’s largest TV studio. These deals will enable us to bring more K-dramas to fans all over the world. 3Over the past several years, we’ve been developing an animation studio within Netflix to produce a wide array of animated content for kids, adults and families. We have amazing creators with pedigree from Disney Animation, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination now working at Netflix on their next big projects. In Q4, we debuted filmmaker Sergio Pablos’ Klaus, our first original feature-length \\u200b \\u200b animated film that was also nominated for an Academy Award. In its first 28 days, 40m members chose to watch this heartwarming Santa Claus origin story. Later in 2020, we’ll premiere the ambitious Over \\u200b The Moon, from legendary animator Glen Keane, followed by a schedule that builds to several big \\u200b animated feature films per year. As we’ve expanded our original content, we’ve been working on how to best share content highlights that demonstrate popularity. Given that we now have titles with widely varying lengths - from short episodes (e.g. Special at around 15 minutes) to long films (e.g. The Highwaymen at 132 minutes), we \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b believe that reporting households viewing a title based on 70% of a single episode of a series or of an entire film, which we have been doing, makes less sense. We are now reporting on households (accounts) that chose to watch a given title1. Our new methodology is similar to the BBC iPlayer in their rankings based on “requests” for the title, “most popular” articles on the New York Times which include \\u200b those who opened the articles, and YouTube view counts. This way, short and long titles are treated equally, leveling the playing field for all types of our content including interactive content, which has no fixed length. The new metric is about 35% higher on average than the prior metric. For example, 45m member households chose to watch Our Planet under the new metric vs. 33m under the prior metric. \\u200b \\u200b Product and Partnerships In Product, we are investing our resources to grow engagement and our storytelling capabilities (like the branching narratives in Black Mirror: Bandersnatch), deepen our penetration in key markets and help \\u200b \\u200b our members find great content through better suggestions. To do this, we try many approaches; in 2019 alone, we conducted hundreds of product tests to try to improve our member experience from sign up to billing and payments to content discovery. About 30% of these led to a gain in retention, engagement or revenue, up from 20% in the prior year. It’s a humbling exercise as so many of our ideas do not “win” with members, but this helps tune our judgment and innovation priorities for the future. In Q4, we launched a mobile-only plan in Malaysia and Indonesia (which we introduced to India in Q3 last year). We’ve seen similar results with this plan driving incremental subscriber growth and improving retention. We expect the mobile-only plan to be revenue-positive which will allow us to further invest in content to be enjoyed by our members and continue to feed the virtuous cycle. We plan to continue to test adding this plan, as well as additional ideas in other countries around the world. Competition Many media companies and tech giants are launching streaming services, reinforcing the major trend of the transition from linear to streaming entertainment. This is happening all over the world and is still in its early stages, leaving ample room for many services to grow as linear TV wanes. We have a big 1 Chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes -- long enough to indicate the choice was intentional -- is the precise definition 4headstart in streaming and will work to build on that by focusing on the same thing we have focused on for the past 22 years - pleasing members. We believe if we do that well, Netflix will continue to prosper. As an example, in Q4, despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the US on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters. Below is a comparison of Google search trends for The Witcher, Disney’s The Mandalorian, Amazon’s \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Jack Ryan and Apple’s The Morning Show. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Disney+ were global we don’t think the picture would be much different, to judge from the NL results where Disney+ first launched. \\u200b \\u200b Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q4, net cash used in operating activities was -$1.5 billion vs. -$1.2 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2 in Q4 totaled -$1.7 billion vs. -$1.3 billion in Q4’18. For the full year, FCF was -$3.3 billion which we believe is the peak in our annual FCF deficit. Our plan is to continually improve FCF each year and to move slowly toward FCF positive. For 2020, we currently forecast FCF of approximately -$2.5 billion. Along the way, we’ll continue to use the debt market to finance our investment needs as we did in Q4’19, when we raised $1.0 billion 4.875% senior notes and 1.1 billion 3.625% senior notes, both due in 2030. With our FCF profile improving, this means € that over time we’ll be less reliant on public markets and will be able to fund more of our investment needs organically through our growing operating profits. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2019, July 2019, April 2019, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b January 2019, October 2018, July 2018, April 2018, January 2018. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Appendix Table 1 6Table 2 (Final letter for this table) 7January 21, 2020 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST Our video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm \\u200b \\u200b PST today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       "  \"We achieved several milestones in 2021: we had the biggest TV show of the year (Squid Game), our two biggest film releases of all time (Red NoticeandDon’t Look Up) and Netflix was the most Emmy-winning and most nominated TV network and the most Oscar-winning and nominated movie studio of 2021. Full year revenue of $30 billion grew 19% year over year while operating income of $6.2 billion rose 35% year over year. We finished Q4 with 222m paid memberships (with 8.3m paid net adds in Q4). Even in a world of uncertainty and increasing competition, we’re optimistic about our long-term growth prospects as streaming supplants linear entertainment around the world. We're continually improving Netflix so that we can please our members, grow our share of leisure time and lead in this transition. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Revenue in Q4’21 grew 16% year over year with a 9% increase in average paid memberships. ARM1rose 7% year over year on both a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, two percentage points faster than Q3’21 (ex-F/X). Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 8%, a six percentage point decrease vs. the year ago period. The decline in operating margin was expected given our large content slate in Q4 this year. Operating margin was above our beginning of quarter forecast of 6.5% due to slightly lower than forecasted content spend. As a result, our full year operating margin was 21% vs. 18% in 2020, 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1above our 20% guidance forecast. EPS in Q4 of $1.33 vs. $1.19 a year ago included a $104m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We slightly over-forecasted paid net adds in Q4 (8.3m actual compared to the 8.5m paid net adds in both the year ago quarter and our beginning of quarter projection). For the full year 2021, paid net adds totaled 18m vs 37m in 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with more than 90% of our paid net adds in 2021 coming from outside the UCAN region. Nonetheless, our UCAN region added 1.2m paid memberships in Q4’21 (vs. 0.9m last year), marking our strongest quarter of member growth in this region since the early days of COVID-19 in 2020. In APAC, we increased paid memberships by 2.6m (vs. 2.0m in the year ago quarter) with strong growth in both Japan and India. EMEA was our largest contributor to paid net adds in Q4 (3.5m vs. 4.5m in the prior year period) and the region delivered record quarterly revenue, exceeding $2.5 billion for the first time. LATAM paid net adds totaled 1.0m vs. 1.2m last year. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and in others it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net adds performance vs. forecast. For Q1’22, we forecast paid net adds of 2.5m vs. 4.0m in the year ago quarter. Our guidance reflects a more back-end weighted content slate in Q1’22 (for example,BridgertonS2 and our new original film The Adam Projectwill both be launching in March).In addition, while retention and engagement remain healthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels. We think this may be due to several factors including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts of the world like LATAM. 2For 2022, we are currently targeting an operating margin of 19%-20% (assuming no material swings in foreign currency from current levels). Our operating margin outlook is driven by two main factors. First, as seen in the chart below, we delivered above the three percentage point annual linear progression over the past two years (average of four percentage points per year). Second, theUS dollar has strengthened meaningfullyagainst most other currencies. With ~60% of our revenue outside of the US due to our international success, we estimate that the US dollar’s appreciation over the past six months has cost us roughly $1 billion in expected 2022 revenue (as a reminder, we don’t hedge). With the vast majority of our expenses in US dollars, this translates into an estimated two percentage point negative impact on our 2022 operating margin. As we have written in the past, over the medium term we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. In the near term, we want to continue to invest appropriately in our business and don’t want to over-react to F/X fluctuations to the detriment of our long term growth. There is no change to our goal of steadily growing our operating margin at an average increase of three percentage points per year over any few year period. 3Content Our Q4 content slate epitomizes what we strive for: a wide variety of quality TV series and films. We had a number of big hits in Q4. We released new seasons of returning shows likeThe Witcher(484 million hours viewed2),You(468m hours viewed),Emily inParis(287 million hours viewed) and on December 31, Cobra Kai(274m hours viewed*), as well as the criticallyacclaimed limited seriesMaid(469m hours viewed). The dystopian Korean thrillerSquid Game- a late Q3 release that broke through globally early in Q4 - generated 1.65 billion hours viewed in its first four weeks and is now our biggest TV season ever. The fourth quarter also featured the conclusion to one of our most popular shows -La Casa de Papelaka Money Heist(6.7 billion hours viewed over its lifetime).We’re excited to expand theLCDPuniverse with our Korean adaptation,Money Heist: Korea - JointEconomic Area, launching later this year. Over the years, we’ve learned that big hits can come from anywhere in the world (with great subtitles and dubbing), as we’ve seen withLa Casa de Papel,Squid Game, andLupinto name just a few. But our goal with non-English originals is to first and foremost thrill audiences in their home country. And in the quarter, we saw big local viewing for titles such asLove is Blind Brazil,My Namefrom Korea, superhero filmMinnal Muralifrom India and Danish thrillerThe Chestnut Man. Film is incredibly important for our members, which is why our ambition has always been to work with the world’s best filmmakers and stars to create a wide variety of quality movies. We took a large step forward in Q4 on this front with our biggest film slate ever. Our blockbusterRed Notice(starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds) quickly became our most popular movie launch of all-time with 364 million hours viewed in its first four weeks. Other hits this quarter includeThe Unforgivable,starring 2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release.

Yangand Nina Dobrev (134m hours viewed), animated featureBack to the Outback(105m hours viewed)andThe Harder They Fall(122m hours viewed). On Christmas Eve, we released the star-studded satireDon’t Look Up(featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep), which is already our second most popular film ever with 353m* hours viewed. Overall in 2021, Netflix series accounted for six out of the 10 most searched shows globally while our films represented two of the top 10. Google Year in Search, 2021 (Global) In November we debuted our mobile games experience globally on Android and iOS. Members can now discover and launch games from within the Netflix mobile app. Since launch, we released an additional five games, bringing the total to ten for 2021. It’s still very early days but we’re pleased with our progress. In 2022, we’ll expand our portfolio of games across both casual and core gaming genres as we continue to program a breadth of game types to learn what our members enjoy most. Marketing & Communications One of our goals with marketing is to help drive conversation about and passion for our titles. We know that Netflix fans want to dive deeper into what they watch with behind-the-scenes details, interviews, and updates. To make it easier and more engaging for our fans, we’ve launched the siteTudum(named after our “sonic logo”) as a home for extending stories and conversation and further building fandom for our TV shows and films. Product & Pricing Netflix offers a wide variety of TV shows and films to its members, which we know they value. We also work hard to make it easy for members to access this content. For instance, in October, we introduced voice-driven Play Something, first on Amazon Fire TV devices (TVs, sticks, and set top boxes). Now, members can simply say “Play Something on Netflix” or “Play a movie on Netflix” and playback will start 5regardless of whether you are browsing Netflix or another service. If they don’t like what’s playing, simply saying “play something else” or “next” will play the next title in the list. Voice-driven Play Something makes choosing effectively effortless. In December, welowered our pricesin India acrossall four plans. India is fairly unique because pay TV pricing is very low. We believe these new prices will make Netflix more accessible to a broader swath of the population - strengthening our value perception. Our goal is to maximize long term revenue in each of our markets. Competition Consumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time - competition that has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering. While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth some, we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched. This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition from linear to streaming and that with under 10% of total TV screen time in the US, our biggest market, Netflix has tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$403 million vs. -$138 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)3for the quarter was-$569 million vs. -$284 million in Q4‘20. For the full year 2021, FCF amounted to -$159 million, in-line with our expectation for “approximately break-even.” We didn’t engage in share repurchases in Q4 as we funded our acquisition of the Roald Dahl Story Company from cash on hand during the quarter. We anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We’re also targeting $10-$15 billion of gross debt. We finished Q4 with gross debt of $15.5 billion and we’ll pay down $700 million of our senior notes due in Q1’22. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) While our current governance structure has served our shareholders extraordinarily well with a sustained period of substantial growth, we’ve clearly proven our business model: streaming is now an established business, we’re self-funding and expect sustained positive free cash flow, and we’ve substantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margin. So the Netflix Board has decided to evolve to a more standard large-cap governance structure and will recommend several changes at our 3For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6next annual meeting. These include declassifying our board, removing supermajority voting provisions in our charter and bylaws, and enabling shareholders to call special meetings. We will also change the voting standard for our directors in uncontested elections.

       "  'Summary:  Q4’22 revenue, operating profit and membership growth exceeded our forecast - we continue to lead the industry in streaming engagement, revenue and profit.  Our Q4 content slate outperformed even our high expectations:  Wednesdaywas our third most popular series ever,Harry & Meghanour second most popular documentary series,Trollour most popularnon-English film, andGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mysteryour fourth most popular film1.  We successfully launched our new, lower priced ad-supported plan in November and are pleased with the early results, with much more still to do.  We delivered on the high end of our operating profit margin target for full year 2022, and we expect to increase our operating margin in 2023 vs. 2022.  For 2022, we finished with 231M paid memberships and generated $32B of revenue, $5.6B in operating income, $2.0B of net cash from operating activities and $1.6B of free cash flow (FCF). In 2023, we expect at least $3B of FCF, assuming no material swings in F/X.  Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters are now co-CEOs of Netflix, with Reed Hastings as Executive Chairman – completing our succession process. 2022 was a tough year, with a bumpy start but a brighter finish. We believe we have a clear path to reaccelerate our revenue growth: continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix, launching paid sharing and building our ads offering. As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building even greater profitability over time. 1As defined by cumulative view hours in the first 28 days 1Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters as our co-CEOs To complete our succession process, Reed Hastings has become Executive Chairman, and Greg Peters has stepped up from COO to become Ted Sarandos’ co-CEO, and a member of the Netflix board. Reed, Greg, and Ted have been working closely together for 15 years, and this makes formal externally how we have been operating internally. More details are here on ourblog. Ted said: “I want to thank Reed for his visionary leadership, mentorship and friendship over the last 20 years. We’ve all learned so much from his intellectual rigor, honesty and willingness to take big bets – and we look forward to working with him for many more years to come. Since Reed started to delegate management to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values and like-minded approach to growth. I am so excited to start this new chapter with Greg as co-CEO.” Greg said: \"I feel humbled and privileged to become co-CEO of Netflix. Ted and I have worked together for many years – building tremendous trust and respect for each other. We\\'re also motivated by the same goal: a desire to better serve our members so that we can continue to grow our business.” In addition to these changes, Bela Bajaria, formerly Head of Global TV, has become Chief Content Officer and Scott Stuber has become Chairman of Netflix Film. Ted said: “Bela and Scott are outstanding creative executives with proven track records at Netflix. In 2022 we premiered many of our most popular series and films in Netflix history, including Wednesday, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Purple Hearts, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, The Adam Project and Harry & Meghan – a testament to their leadership and creativity. I couldn’t be more excited to work alongside them as we seek to delight audiences for years to come.” For full details of Netflix leadership seehere. Q4 Results Year over year revenue growth of 2% in Q4 (10% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis2) was driven by a 4% increase in average paid memberships. ARM3declined 2% year over year, but grew 5% on a F/X neutral basis2. Revenue was slightly above our beginning-of-quarterprojection, as paid net adds of 7.7M (vs. 8.3M in Q4’21) came in higher than our 4.5M forecast, due to both strong acquisition and retention, driven primarily by the success of our Q4 content slate. In addition, the US dollar depreciated vs. most other currencies during the quarter, which resulted in slightly higher than projected ARM. Operating income of $550M in Q4 was down vs. $632M in Q4 ‘21. This was above our guidance forecast of $330M primarily due to higher than expected revenue as well as slower-than-forecasted hiring. Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 7% compared to 8% in Q4’21. This year over year decline was due to the appreciation of the US dollar. For the full year 2022, our operating margin amounted to 18% vs. 2Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchangerate movements. Assumes foreign exchange rates remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. 3ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 221% in FY21. Based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022 and excluding the $150M in restructuring charges in Q2’22, this translates into an operating margin of 20%, at the high end of the 19%-20% target we set inJanuary of 2022. F/X Neutral Operating Margin (Excluding Restructuring Charges in Q2 2022)  Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year (and excluding the $150M of restructuring costs in Q2 2022). Note: Excludes F/X impact on content amortization, as titles are amortized at a historical blended rate based on timing of spend. EPS in Q4’22 was $0.12 vs. $1.33 in Q4‘21. This was below our $0.36 forecast due to a $462M non-cash unrealized loss from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt as a result of the depreciation of the US dollar vs. the Euro during Q4’22. As a reminder, our approximately $5B of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge on the relative value of the Euro for net income. However, it doesn’t affect operating income as unrealized gains or losses are recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” For the full year, we recognized a non-cash unrealized gain of $353M from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro bonds. Forecast As we noted in our Q3’22 shareholder letter, revenue is our primary top line metric, particularly as we develop additional revenue streams where membership is just one component of our growth (like advertising and paid sharing). The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the rollout of major new initiatives (paid sharing and ads) plus current uncertain macroeconomic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. We forecast Q1’23 revenue growth of 4% (8% on a F/X neutral basis). We expect our F/X neutral revenue growth to be driven by a combination of year over year growth in average paid memberships and ARM. This translates into modest positive paid net adds in Q1 ‘23 (vs. paid net adds of -0.2M in Q1’22). Our 3expectation of fewer paid net adds in Q1’23 vs. Q4’22 is consistent with normal seasonality and factors in our strong member growth in Q4’22, which likely pulled forward some growth from Q1’23. In addition, we expect to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1’23 (more details below in the Product and Pricing section). We anticipate that this will result in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2’23 than in Q1’23. From our experience in Latin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing, which impacts near term member growth. But as borrower households begin to activate their own standalone accounts and extra member accounts are added, we expect to see improved overall revenue, which is our goal with all plan and pricing changes. Our long term financial objectives remain unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expand operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. For the full year 2023, as we continue to improve our service, grow our advertising business and launch paid sharing, we expect constant currency revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. We also expect year over year operating profit growth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F/X). We have been targeting a FY23 operating margin of 19%-20% based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022. We now expect to deliver roughly 21%-22% operating margin on this basis (above the 19%-20% range). Rolling forward to F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, this translates into a FY23 operating margin target of 18%-20%. For Q1’23, we expect operating margin to be down year over year (20% vs. 25%) due primarily to the timing of content spend. Content and Marketing People have more choice of films and TV shows than ever so we need to ensure that there’s always something great for them to watch on Netflix, regardless of their taste, mood, or who they’re watching with. It’s why we’re so focused on continuing to improve our content and broaden our slate. 2022\\'s successful slate was the result of having the best creative executives working with best in class creators. Last year alone we launched4:  Five of our Top 10 most popular English language TV seasons ever –Stranger Things 4and Wednesday(both of which hit 1B hours viewed), Monster:The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,Bridgerton S2 andInventing Anna– as well asHarry & Meghan,our second most successful doc series ever;  Four of our Top 10 most popular English language films ever–The Adam Project, The Gray Man, Purple HeartsandGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery– as well asThe Sea BeastandThe Tinder Swindler, our most successful animated and documentaryfilms respectively;  Seven of our Top 10 most popular non-English films ever –Troll(Norway),All Quiet on the Western Front(Germany),Black Crab(Sweden),ThroughMy Window(Spain),The Takedown (France),My Name is Vendetta(Italy), andLovingAdults(Denmark);  Two of our Top 10 most popular non-English TV shows ever–All of Us Are Deadand Extraordinary Attorney Woo, both from Korea. 4For View Hours for these titles, please visitNetflixTop 10. 4We’re also pleased with the progress we’ve made with returning titles. Members watched more Netflix returning seasons and sequels in 2022 than ever before across a broad range of genres – from film (Enola Holmes2,Lost Bullet2 and two365 Dayssequels) and unscripted (Selling SunsetS5 andLove is BlindS3) to award winning drama (OzarkS4 andThe CrownS5),local language series (SintoniaS3,Young RoyalsS2 andAlice in BorderlandS2, whose success pushed S1back into the Top 10 after its launch) and animation (Big MouthS6). It’s hard to think of two titles that more successfully pierced the zeitgeist this year thanStranger Things4 andWednesday. Both pushed old songs into the musiccharts: Kate Bush’sRunning Up That Hillwent to number 1 on Billboard’s Global charts for the first time, 37 years after it was first released, and Lady Gaga’sBloody Marymade it onto the Billboard top40 list for the first time ever, 11 years after it was first released. We get amazing results when we have aWednesday,Glass OnionorMonstermoment with our members. We believe people typically sign up for a streaming service because they’ve heard about a title “you simply must watch” from a friend, seen the excitement on social media or read about it in the press. Generating conversation is our primary marketing goal because we see that it drives acquisition and encourages existing members to watch more, which in turn helps with retention. For Ryan Murphy’s The Watcher, conversation about the series led tofans flocking to the house, aSaturday Night Livespoof and a spike inhome security sales. OurWednesdaycampaign, with all our marketing in Wednesday’s iconic voice, generated 1.5B organic social impressionspre-launch, a record for a Netflix season one. Over time, we hope to have more and more of these moments across film and TV, and to replicate these successes on the games side. It’s now slightly over a year since we launched games on the Netflix service. We’ve madegood progress in that time - creating the infrastructure to deliver games to mobile devices, building a portfolio of 50 games across many genres and acquiring four game studios to bolster our internal production capabilities. In Q4, we launched season four of unscripted seriesToo Hot to Handle,which was a top 10 title for us globally for three consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, we debuted ourToo Hot to Handle game, which has been our biggest game launch to date and is another encouraging sign in the long term opportunity to entertain members with Netflix intellectual property (IP) across different mediums. In 2023, we’ll continue toexpand our offeringwith moregames, with a focus on Netflix-related IP. Product and Pricing As discussed over the past few quarters, we’re working to give people more choice when it comes to price as well as greater control over their Netflix account. In November, we successfully launched our new, lower priced ad-supported plan in 12 countries. We believe branded television advertising is a substantial long term incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Netflix, and our ability to stand up this business in six months underscores our commitment both to give members more choice and to reaccelerate our growth. While it’s still early days for ads and we have lots to do (in particular better targeting and measurement), we are pleased with our progress to date across every dimension: member experience, value to advertisers, and incremental contribution to our business. Engagement, which is consistent with members on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected and we believe the lower 5price point is driving incremental membership growth. Also, as expected, we’ve seen very little switching from other plans. Overall the reaction to this launch from both consumers and advertisers has confirmed our belief that our ad-supported plan has strong unit economics (at minimum, in-line with or better than the comparable ad-free plan) and will generate incremental revenue and profit, though the impact on 2023 will be modest given that this will build slowly over time. Later in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business. While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change for members who share their account more broadly. So we’ve worked hard to build additional new features that improve the Netflix experience, including the ability for members to review which devices are using their account and to transfer a profile to a new account. As we roll out paid sharing, members in many countries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t live with. As is the case today,allmembers will be ableto watch while traveling, whether on a TV or mobile device. As we work through this transition – and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don’t convert to extra members or full paying accounts – near term engagement, as measured by third parties like Nielsen’s The Gauge, could be negatively impacted. However, we believe the pattern will be similar to what we’ve seen in Latin America, with engagement growing over time as we continue to deliver a great slate of programming and borrowers sign-up for their own accounts. Competition We continue to operate in a highly competitive market as consumers have a vast number of entertainment choices. Beyond our direct streaming competitors, we also vie for consumers’ time against linear TV, YouTube, short form entertainment like TikTok, and gaming, to name just a few. The silver lining is that the market for entertainment is huge and Netflix is still very small by comparison. For example, in the more than 190 countries we operate in, our $30B+ of annual revenue compares against the combined annual estimated ~$300B pay TV/streaming industry, $180B branded TV advertising spend and $130 billion consumer spend on gaming5. It’s not easy to build a large and profitable streaming business. But we’re competing from a position of strength, as we lead the industry in terms of engagement, revenue and streaming profit. As a pure-play streaming company, we’re also not anchored to shrinking legacy business models, like traditional entertainment firms, allowing us to lean hard into the big growth opportunity ahead of us. As we’ve said before, beyond revenue and profitability, another way to look at our business is through engagement, and we are pleased to have Kantar join Nielsen – who have expanded their efforts – and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming as well as the viewing share of different entertainment companies in Brazil, Mexico, and Poland. 5Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludes hardware sales. 6As can be seen in the newly reported markets of Mexico, Brazil, and Poland, we are less than 5% of TV viewing. And in our largest markets like the US and the UK, we are still less than 10% of TV screen time. As one of the leaders in streaming across all markets, we’re encouraged by the fact that streaming overall accounts for less than 40% of viewing across these markets (and as little as 6% in Poland). We believe ultimately the vast majority of time spent on TV will happen via streaming, which should provide a long runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. tablet and laptop), all others are TV only. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities was $0.4B in Q4’22 (vs. -$0.4B in the prior year period) and $2.0B for FY22 (vs. $0.4B in FY21). Free cash flow (FCF)6for Q4 totaled $0.3B, compared with -$0.6Bin the year ago quarter. For FY22, we generated FCF of $1.6B (vs. -$0.2B in FY21), above our forecast of approximately $1B. Now that we are a decade into our original programming initiative and have successfully scaled it, we are past the most cash intensive phase of this buildout. As a result, we believe we will now be generating sustained, positive annual free cash flow going forward. Assuming no material swings in F/X, we expect at least $3B of FCF for the full year 2023. We closed two previously announced acquisitions in Q4 - leading animation studioAnimal Logicand games studioSpry Fox. We funded these purchases fromcash on hand. 6Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activitiesless purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. 7Gross debt at quarter end totaled $14B, in-line with our targeted range of $10-$15B. With cash and short term investments of $6B, net debt totaled $8B, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA.7We don’t have any scheduled debt maturities in FY23 and only $400M of debt maturities in FY24. All of our debt is fixed rate. Our capital structure policy is unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (e.g., about $5.2B based on Q4 revenue). After meeting those needs, we intend to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Assuming no material acquisitions, we anticipate resuming our share buyback program in 2023. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Two years ago we increased our focus on sustainability and related initiatives8– building a team of experts, announcing an ambitious environmentalcommitment,and exploring creative-friendly ways to reduce emissions in our productions (which account for more than half of our emissions as a company). As a result,Netflix production sets are becomingmore sustainablethrough cleaner technologies, including electric vehicles and clean alternatives to diesel generators. In 2021, we created theNetflix Fund for CreativeEquity, committing $100M over five years to further develop our pipeline for underrepresented talent. Through the fund, Netflix supports external organizations committed to creating equitable opportunities in the TV and film industries, as well as bespoke Netflix programsthat help us to identify,train and provide job placement for emerging talent globally. To date we\\'ve committed $29M towards these initiatives, supporting over 1,000 up-and-coming creatives and more than 35 programs around the world.

       "  '2020 was an incredibly difficult year with extraordinary loss for so many families, new restrictions that none of us have ever had to live with before and great uncertainty. We’re enormously grateful that in these uniquely challenging times we’ve been able to provide our members around the world with a source of escape, connection and joy while continuing to build our business. With 8.5m paid net additions in Q4, we crossed the 200m paid memberships mark. For the full year, we added a record 37m paid memberships, achieved $25 billion in annual revenue (+24% year over year) and grew operating profit 76% to $4.6 billion. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Average paid streaming memberships increased 23% year over year in Q4, while average revenue per membership1 was flat year over year both on a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis. Revenue was 1% higher than our guidance forecast, as paid net adds exceeded our 6.0m projection by 2.5m. Operating margin of 14.4% (a 600bps increase from Q4’19) also came in above our guidance, due to higher-than-expected revenue. EPS of $1.19 vs. $1.30 a year ago included a $258m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. For the full year, our 37m paid net additions represented a 31% increase from 2019’s 28m paid net adds. We’re becoming an increasingly global service with 83% of our paid net adds in 2020 coming from 1 Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of \\u200b streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period; it was previously referred to as streaming ARPU. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1outside the UCAN region. Our EMEA region accounted for 41% of our full year paid net adds, while APAC was the second largest contributor to paid net additions with 9.3m (up 65% year over year). As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q1’21, we expect paid net adds of 6.0m vs. last Q1’s 15.8m, which included the impact from the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. Since the start of 2018, our paid memberships have risen from 111m to 204m and our average revenue per membership has grown from $9.88 to $11.02, despite significant F/X headwinds. This approach has allowed us to organically increase revenue by $4-$5 billion annually over the past several years. We’ve made good progress growing our profitability with FY20 operating margin of 18% rising five percentage points over prior year. For FY21, we’re now targeting a 20% operating margin, up two percentage points from 2020 and higher than our previous 19% forecast, due to a more favorable revenue outlook. As we said last quarter, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year at an average rate of three percentage points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate some lumpiness. Some years we’ll be a little over (like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021), but we are trying to keep on an average three percentage points per year long-term trajectory. Content The big growth in streaming entertainment has led legacy competitors like Disney, WarnerMedia and Discovery to compete with us in new ways, which we’ve been expecting for many years. This is, in part, why we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a wide range of genres and nations. Our fourth quarter slate highlights the breadth and diversity of our entertainment offering. 2In scripted English language television, season four of the critically acclaimed The Crown was the biggest \\u200b \\u200b season so far and drove new watchers of prior seasons. In its first 28 days, more member households chose to watch season four of The Crown than each of the prior seasons, helping to grow the number of \\u200b \\u200b member households that have chosen to watch this series to over 100m since its initial launch. In late December, we released our first original series from Shonda Rhimes, Bridgerton. This title has proven \\u200b \\u200b immensely popular and we’ll have some exciting news about Bridgerton later this week. \\u200b \\u200b Our largest original film of the quarter was The Midnight Sky, starring and directed by George Clooney; \\u200b \\u200b we estimate 72m member households will choose to watch this title in its first four weeks. In its first 28 days, 43m member households chose to watch our animated feature film Over the Moon (directed by \\u200b \\u200b legendary creator Glen Keane) with high levels of rewatching. We Can Be Heroes (directed by Robert \\u200b \\u200b Rodriguez) was another successful family film with a projected 53m member households choosing this title in its first four weeks. Our holiday movie slate also resonated with our members; in the first four weeks, 68m and 61m member households chose to watch Holidate (starring Emma Roberts) and The Christmas Chronicles: \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Part Two (starring Kurt Russell), respectively. Our first Portuguese language holiday film from Brazil, Just \\u200b \\u200b Another Christmas (starring Leandro Hassum), was also a big hit with 26m member households globally \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b choosing to watch in the first 28 days of release. We continue to ramp up our local original content slate. Our top local titles this quarter include Barbarians (a historical action series from Germany that 37m member households globally chose to \\u200b watch in the first four weeks), Sweet Home, our Korean language horror show (22m member \\u200b \\u200b households), Selena: The Series, which particularly resonated with members throughout Mexico and the \\u200b \\u200b US (25m member households globally), and Alice in Borderland, a sci-fi thriller from Japan (18m member \\u200b \\u200b households). While designed to be very impactful in the home country, we see many cases of our local originals traveling more broadly. For example, Lupin, an adrenalin-filled French language heist series \\u200b \\u200b released in early January, has hit #2 in our US Top 10 list and ranked #1 in dozens of other countries including Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Vietnam, the Philippines and many more. We project 70m member households will choose to watch Lupin in its first 28 days of release. \\u200b \\u200b In addition to titles with big viewership, we also aspire to have hits that become part of the cultural zeitgeist. In 2020 alone, we had Tiger King, Bridgerton and The Queen’s Gambit. Not only did 62m \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b member households choose to watch The Queen’s Gambit in its first 28 days (making this show our \\u200b \\u200b biggest limited series in Netflix history), but it ignited sales of chess sets and inspired the next generation \\u200b \\u200b of chess prodigies. In fact, Netflix series accounted for nine out of the 10 most searched shows globally in 2020, while our films represented two of the top 10. 3Google Year in Search, 2020 (Global) \\u200b \\u200b Our productions are back up and running in most regions - we have learned that flexibility and adaptability are paramount in this fast-changing environment. With over 500 titles currently in post production or preparing to launch on our service and plans to release at least one new original film \\u200b every week in 2021 with extraordinary talent, we’re confident we’ll continue to have a great content \\u200b offering for our members. In Q1, in addition to the recently released season 3 of Cobra Kai and Lupin, we’re excited to be launching \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b later this quarter To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before 3, the finale to this beloved rom com trilogy, our \\u200b \\u200b young adult drama Fate: The Winx Saga, Yes Day (a family movie starring Jennifer Garner), Sky Rojo, a \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b thrilling new series from the creators of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist) and Space Sweepers, an \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b action packed Korean sci-fi film. Product Last year, we continued to improve our parental controls so that families have more control over their experience. These enhancements include allowing members to filter out content at the title level or by maturity rating, creating a profile lock PIN and customizing autoplay settings for any profile. We also extended parental control support to downloads to give parents peace of mind regardless of how Netflix is used. And we provided parents with more transparency into the themes, characters and content that their kids love with the Kids Activity Report, a weekly message designed to keep parents informed about the content their children are watching. As we bring our members more great programming, we’re always listening and working to make it easier for them to find the right show and film to watch. That’s why last year we debuted our Top 10 lists around the world, and in October we introduced the New & Popular tab in our television user interface, which includes a new Worth the Wait section, highlighting titles as far as a year away that you can remind yourself about. As another exciting step in this effort, we’ve been testing a new feature that 4gives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse. The response has been positive and we plan to roll it out globally in the first half of 2021. Competition It’s a great time to be a consumer of entertainment. There are a wealth of options ranging from linear TV to video gaming to user generated content on YouTube and TikTok. We continue to work hard to grow our small share of screen time against these major competitors. Discovery recently launched its streaming service. Disney+ is expanding in new countries and with more \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b content. ViacomCBS will be unveiling its plans for Paramount+ in 2021. Combined with the launch of AppleTV+, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming services, this signifies that these companies all recognize the future is streaming entertainment, a vision we have been working towards since inception. Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment. This past year is a testament to this approach. Disney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid membership growth in our history. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$138 million vs. -$1.5 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow2 (FCF) for the quarter was -$284 million vs. -$1.7 billion in Q4‘19, bringing full year 2020 free cash flow to +$1.9 billion vs. -$3.3 billion in 2019. We believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive. For the full year 2021, we currently anticipate free cash flow will be around break even (vs. our prior expectation for -$1 billion to break even). Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750m undrawn credit facility, we believe \\u200b we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations. Our 5.375% \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b February 1, 2021 bonds mature in Q1. We plan on repaying the bond at maturity out of cash on hand, as we are currently well above our minimum cash needs. As we generate excess cash, we intend to maintain $10B-15B in gross debt and will explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks, as we did in the past (2007-2011). Long-Term Stock Price Performance We thank our equity and debt investors for their trust and for coming along with us on our journey to build one of the world’s leading entertainment companies. Since day one, we’ve managed Netflix for the long term under the belief that pleasing our members would lead to strong value creation for our fellow shareholders. Going forward, in each January investor letter, we’ll provide an update on our long-term stock performance. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the \\u200b reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5Annualized Performance (%)* 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 Year Since IPO NFLX 67% 41% 36% 36% 40% S&P 500 18% 14% 15% 14% 9% NASDAQ 45% 24% 22% 18% 13% Cumulative Return (%)* 1 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 Year Since IPO NFLX 67% 182% 373% 2,054% 50,388% S&P 500 18% 49% 103% 267% 399% NASDAQ 45% 93% 172% 444% 830%  As of 12/31/20.

       "  'In Q1, we surpassed $2.5 billion in quarterly streaming revenue and added 5 million members. The opportunity provided to us by the growth of the global internet is gigantic and our plan is to keep investing as we increase membership, revenue and operating margins. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast The quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report, and we strive for accuracy. In Q1, there were no substantial variations from our January guidance forecast. Due to content (primarily House of Cards season 5) moving from Q1 to Q2, we had higher operating \\u200b \\u200b margins in Q1 (as forecasted) at 9.7% than our plan for the year (about 7%). We forecast operating margin at 4.4% in Q2, placing us on track to reach our 7% target for the full year. The other effect of the content moves is lower net adds in Q1 compared to prior year (as expected) and heavier net adds in Q2 compared to prior year (about double). We have come to see these quarterly variances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV. For the first half of this year, for example, we expect to have 8.15 million net adds, compared to 8.42 million net adds in the first half last year. International net additions decreased 22% year over year, as we lapped our January 2016 launch of over 130 countries, and the accompanying early surge demand, in Q1 2016. Revenue for the international segment grew 62% year over year, excluding a -$12 million impact from currency, while ASP rose 12% year over year on a F/X neutral basis. Q1 was the first quarter of consolidated profit for our international segment as profit growth in our more mature territories offset investments in newer markets. Our forward guidance shows that we intend to continue to invest internationally, projecting a small loss for Q2. We have high satisfaction and are rapidly growing in Latin America, Europe, and North America. We are making good strides in improving our content offering to match local tastes in Asia, Middle East, and Africa, but have much progress to make, like in Latin America a few years ago. Our year-over-year streaming revenue growth is benefiting from a price change in mid 2016, and will moderate over the course of the year to track membership growth more closely. We are seeing a small but steady migration to our 4-stream, 4K-UHD-HDR video quality tier, which is our high end plan. That will keep revenue growth slightly above membership growth, holding F/X constant. For the last several years we’ve had flat operating margins due to established markets funding international expansion with every spare dollar we had. Because of that, the major indicators of our progress were member and revenue growth and US contribution margins. Starting this year, we can be primarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics. The summary table above has been reorganized to reflect that, while maintaining comparability to the past. Content With a growing member base spread across the world, we seek to please diverse tastes with a wide breadth of content. The key releases this past quarter highlight this range of programming: A Series of \\u200b Unfortunate Events, a dark comedy for the entire family, Santa Clarita Diet, a “zom-com” starring Drew \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Barrymore and Ultimate Beastmaster, our first competition show which pits athletes from around the \\u200b \\u200b globe against a fearsome 600-foot obstacle course. 2In addition to these titles, on March 17, we debuted Marvel’s Iron Fist, which has quickly become \\u200b \\u200b another highly viewed Marvel series, and sets the stage for The Defenders, which brings together all the \\u200b \\u200b characters from the Marvel series later this year. A week later, we launched Ingobernable, our second \\u200b \\u200b Mexican series, starring Kate del Castillo, which has been very popular in Mexico. On the last day of Q1, we unveiled 13 Reasons Why. Below is global search volume for several of our big launches over the last \\u200b \\u200b year. We have also stepped up our investment in stand up comedy which we believe can help grow our business, like our original series. Early results are promising; the triumphant return of a comedy legend in Dave Chappelle: Collection 1 was our most viewed comedy special ever. We are also finding this to be \\u200b \\u200b true in international markets as well, with comedian Gad Elmaleh’s Gad Gone Wild, a breakout hit in \\u200b \\u200b France last quarter. Just ahead of the release of our third film from Adam Sandler, Sandy Wexler, we announced the renewal \\u200b \\u200b of our deal with Sandler to premiere an additional four films exclusively on Netflix around the world. We continue to be excited by our Sandler relationship and our members continue to be thrilled with his films. Since the launch of The Ridiculous 6, Netflix members have spent more than half a billion hours \\u200b \\u200b enjoying the films of Adam Sandler. We recently hired Scott Stuber to lead our original films initiative. Our goal remains the same: to offer a \\u200b \\u200b variety of new movies that will attract and delight members at better economics relative to licensing movies under traditional windowing. Some of our early movies have been successful by this measure, such as the Sandler movies and Siege of Jadotville. Others, such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Sword of Destiny, have not. Scott’s mandate is to increase both the portfolio and the percentage of \\u200b films that delight many of our members relative to the film’s cost. 3Since our members are funding these films, they should be the first to see them. But we are also open to supporting the large theater chains, such as AMC and Regal in the US, if they want to offer our films, such as our upcoming Will Smith film Bright, in theatres simultaneous to Netflix. Let consumers choose. \\u200b \\u200b Product As always, our product team has dozens of tests running in the endless quest for even higher member satisfaction. One test that won conclusively last year and has now been rolled out to all members is our new “thumbs-up thumbs-down” feedback model, replacing the 5-star model we have had from our DVD days. The amount of usage we get with this new approach is over twice as many ratings. With this additional personal input, we’ll be able to improve personalization, making your front screen on Netflix even more relevant. A multi-year effort ahead is to have video replace still images in our user experience in ways that please our members and help them choose what to watch. Video for choosing video is an obvious direction, but doing it well through our interface takes judgment, creativity, and testing. In April, we will add Thai and later in the quarter, Romanian and Hebrew, to the 24 languages we currently support. Marketing As our slate of content expands, we’ll spend over $1 billion in 2017 marketing our content to drive member acquisition. As part of this, we are investing more in programmatic advertising with the aim of improving our ability to do individualized marketing at scale and to deliver the right ad to the right person at the right time. Buttressing this activity is the substantial earned media coverage around the Netflix brand, technology and content we generate globally through events and activities aimed at journalists and social media influencers. We also market our content extensively to members through our service and with our partners. For instance, we participated in Comcast’s Watchathon in April, providing X1 subscribers unlimited access to Netflix for a week. Competition Our investors often ask us about ecosystem change, such as the advent in the US of virtual MVPDs (like Sling, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, YouTube TV and Hulu’s forthcoming service). We believe VMVPDs will likely be more directly competitive to existing MVPD services since they offer a subset of the same channels at $30-$60 per month, and may appeal to a segment of the population that doesn’t subscribe to a pay TV bundle. But we don’t think it will have much of an impact on us as Netflix is largely complementary to pay TV packages. Our focus also is on on-demand, commercial free viewing rather than live, ad-supported programming. Additionally, investors ask us about Amazon’s move into NFL football. That is not a strategy that we think is smart for us since we believe we can earn more viewing and satisfaction from spending that money on movies and TV shows. 4Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q1’17 was -$423 million vs. -$261 million in the year ago quarter and an improvement from -$639 million in Q4’16. The growth in our original content means we continue to plan to have around $2B in negative FCF this year. We have a large market opportunity ahead of us and we’re optimizing long-term FCF by growing our original content aggressively. Negative near-term FCF is the result of the big increases in our original content, combined with small but growing operating margins. Since we want our operating margins to grow slowly so we can spend enough to quickly grow revenue and original content, we anticipate negative FCF to accompany our rapid growth for many years. Our operating margins are our key indicator of improving global profitability; they are already growing and we plan to keep them growing for many years ahead. Eventually, at a much larger revenue base, original content and revenue growth will be slower, and we anticipate substantial positive FCF, like our media peers. Our debt to total cap ratio, at under 10%, is quite conservative compared to most of our media peers at 30-70%, and conservative compared to efficient capital structure theory. Thus we will continue to add long-term debt as needed to finance our expansion of original content, including in Q2’17.

       "  'As expected, revenue growth accelerated 400 basis points to 26%, and operating income increased 53% year over year in Q2. Paid membership grew by 2.7m, less than the 5.5m in Q2 a year ago and our 5.0m forecast. In Q3, we expect to grow by 7m paid memberships, more than the 6.1m in Q3 a year ago. Consumers around the world continue to move from linear television to internet entertainment at a remarkable rate. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Average streaming paid memberships increased 24% year over year, while ARPU increased 3% year over year on a reported basis. Excluding the year over year foreign exchange (F/X) impact on revenue of -$265 million, global streaming ARPU grew 9%, with 12% and 7% ARPU growth in the US and international segments, respectively. Operating margin of 14.3% (up 250 bps year over year) was higher than our beginning-of-quarter forecast as some marketing spend was shifted into the second half of the year. EPS amounted to $0.60 vs. $0.85 and included a $61 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming content obligations decreased 2% sequentially, reflecting our shift to more owned (vs. licensed) content. 1As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We strive for accuracy (not conservatism), which means that in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance. In Q2’19, our membership growth forecast was high. Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases. We don’t believe competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape during Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our over-forecast was in every region). Rather, we think Q2’s content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated. Additionally, Q1 was so large for us (9.6m net adds), there may have been more pull-forward effect than we realized. In prior quarters with over-forecasts, we’ve found that the underlying long-term growth was not affected and staying focused on the fundamentals of our business served us well. Q3 has started with Stranger Things season 3, and the first two weeks of Q3 are strong. In addition to \\u200b \\u200b the recently released season 3 of Stranger Things, our second half content slate includes new seasons of \\u200b \\u200b La Casa de Papel (Money Heist), The Crown, and the final season of the iconic Orange is the New Black as \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b well as big films like The Irishman from Martin Scorsese and action movie 6 Underground (directed by \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds). While our US paid membership was essentially flat in Q2, we expect it to return to more typical growth in Q3, and are seeing that in these early weeks of Q3. We forecast Q3 global paid net adds of 7.0m, up vs. 6.1m in Q3’18, with 0.8m in the US and 6.2m internationally. Our internal forecast still currently calls for annual global paid net adds to be up year over year. There’s no change to our 13% operating margin target for FY19, up 300 basis points year over year. 2Content Our Q2 content slate featured several highly watched titles. We launched Dead to Me, a dramedy \\u200b \\u200b starring 2019 Emmy nominated Best Actress Christina Applegate, which was watched by 30m households in its first four weeks. We’ve renewed this half hour comedy for a second season. We’re also proud of When They See Us, a moving limited series based on the Central Park Five case, from Ava \\u200b \\u200b DuVernay. This powerful story was watched by 25m households in its first four weeks and has stirred a global conversation about race, identity, and criminal justice. When They See Us was also just nominated \\u200b \\u200b for 16 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Limited Series. Our Planet was our most ambitious \\u200b \\u200b undertaking in the documentary category to date and it’s also our highest-watched original docu-series through its first four weeks (33m households) and was just nominated for 10 Emmy Awards. We are making good progress with our original films portfolio with more and more of our films creating larger audiences than our pay 1 licensed movies. At the end of June, we premiered our latest Adam Sandler movie Murder Mystery (also starring Jennifer Aniston), which is the most watched Adam Sandler \\u200b \\u200b Netflix original film to date; over 73m households watched this film in its first four weeks. In Q2, the young adult romantic comedy movie The Perfect Date (featuring Noah Centineo from our big film To All \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b The Boys I’ve Loved Before) was a global hit with 48m households in its first four weeks. Similarly, Ali \\u200b Wong co-starred with Randall Park in Always Be My Maybe (directed by Nahnatchka Khan), which was \\u200b \\u200b viewed by 32m households in its first four weeks. Season 2 of The Rain was among the largest returning seasons for one of our non-English language \\u200b \\u200b originals, while Swedish series Quicksand was a new show that was highly watched both locally and \\u200b \\u200b globally. We also debuted several local-language titles that were very popular in their home territories like the first two installments of the Historia de un Crimen franchise (Historia de un Crimen: Colosio and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b 3Historia de un Crimen: Colmenares) in Latin America, while Family Business was a breakthrough hit for us \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b in France. We’ve been moving our content from semi-exclusive catalog and 2nd-window unbranded content to branded exclusive 1st window original content for many years. Much of our domestic, and eventually global, Disney catalog, as well as Friends, The Office, and some other licensed content will wind down \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b over the coming years, freeing up budget for more original content. We don’t have material viewing concentration as even our largest titles (that are watched by millions of members) account for only a low single digit percentage of streaming hours. From what we’ve seen in the past when we drop strong catalog content (Starz and Epix with Sony, Disney, and Paramount films, or 2nd run series from Fox, for example) our members shift over to enjoying our other great content. Forty of our original series, films and specials were nominated for 117 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy and Drama Series, Limited Series, Animated Series and Reality Series, as well as Variety, Children’s, short form and interactive programs. We are incredibly proud to offer best in class original programming in so many different forms. Marketing As Netflix has shifted to original content, our marketing has evolved to increasingly focus on launching our key titles to build excitement amongst existing and non-members. We’re continuing to invest in owned and earned media, where we can have strong, direct relationships with fans. We’re very excited to welcome Jackie Lee-Joe as our new CMO to help us take our marketing to the next level. \\u200b \\u200b We’re also building out our licensing and brand partnerships effort, which is optimizing for fan and viewer engagement over revenue maximization. For example, for the launch of Stranger Things season \\u200b \\u200b 3, we partnered with best-in-class brands like Coke, Nike, Burger King, and Baskin Robbins to build deep \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b connections with our fans. At E3, the largest video gaming event of the year, we announced a new Stranger Things mobile game, a \\u200b \\u200b game based on our upcoming new show Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (a prequel to the 1982 film), \\u200b \\u200b and a partnership with Epic Games, the developers of Fortnite. Like our other merchandising initiatives, \\u200b \\u200b these games are designed to build fandom for our titles and don’t signal a push into gaming as a new business for Netflix. Product and Partnerships We recently entered into a new partnership with AT&T in the US to integrate Netflix into their new set-top box. In the US, we now partner with a wide range of ISPs and MVPDs, including Comcast, DISH, Verizon, T-Mobile, Charter, and Altice, in addition to AT&T. After several months of testing, we’ve decided to roll out a lower-priced mobile-screen plan in India to complement our existing plans. We believe this plan, which will launch in Q3, will be an effective way to introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market where Pay TV ARPU is low (below $5). We will continue to learn more after launch of this plan. 4Competition Over the next 12 months, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, NBCU and others are joining Hulu, Amazon, BBC, Hotstar, YouTube, Netflix, and many others in offering streaming entertainment. The competition for winning consumers’ relaxation time is fierce for all companies and great for consumers. The innovation of streaming services is also drawing consumers to shift more and more from linear television to streaming entertainment. If you watch Our Planet on a new TV with Dolby Vision or HDR10, you will see \\u200b \\u200b why: the quality of streaming television is spectacular. In the US, our most developed market, we still only earn about 10% of consumers’ television time, and less of their mobile screen time, so we have much room for growth. We, like HBO, are advertising free. That remains a deep part of our brand proposition; when you read speculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be confident that this is false. We believe we will have a more valuable business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue and instead entirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q2’19 was -$544 million vs. -$518 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)1 totaled -$594 million vs. -$559 million in Q2’18. We’re still forecasting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion for the full year 2019 and expect improvement in 2020. From there, we’ll continue to reduce our free cash flow deficit as we intend to continue growing our member base, revenues, and operating margin, which provides a clear path towards positive FCF. In the meantime, our plan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments as we did in April. In our most recent round, we raised 10.5 year senior notes of 1.2 billion (3.875% coupon) and $900 million (5.375% € coupon).

       "  \"For Q2, revenue and operating income were right on forecast. Our streaming membership grew more than expected, from 99m to 104m, due to our amazing content. We also crossed the symbolic milestones of 100m members and more international than domestic members. It was a good quarter. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Our quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q2, we underestimated the popularity of our strong slate of content which led to higher-than-expected acquisition across all major territories. As a result, global net adds totaled a Q2-record 5.2 million (vs. forecast of 3.2m) and increased 5% sequentially, bucking historical seasonal patterns. For the first six months of 2017, net adds are up 21% year-on-year to 10.2m. Our Q3 guidance assumes much of this momentum will continue but we are cognizant of the lessons of prior quarters when we over-forecasted and there was lumpiness in net adds, likely due to demand being pulled forward (into Q2 in this case). Domestic net additions of 1.1m represented the highest level of Q2 net adds since the second quarter of 2011. For Q3’17, we project that we will add 0.75m US members, compared with 0.37m in Q3’16, which was impacted by un-grandfathering. Our international segment now accounts for 50.1% of our total membership base. International revenue rose 57% year over year, excluding a -$23 million impact from foreign exchange, while international ASP grew 10% year over year on a F/X neutral basis. International contribution profit of -$13 million vs. -$69 million was better than our -$28 million forecast due primarily to higher-than-forecasted paid members. We’re forecasting Q3’17 international net adds of 3.65 million. We are making good progress with our international expansion as improving profitability in our earlier international markets helps fund significant investment in our newer territories. As a result, we expect positive international \\u200b contribution profit for the full year 2017, at current F/X exchange rates. This would mark the first ever \\u200b annual contribution profit from our international segment. For Q2, global streaming revenue was within 1% of our projection. As expected, operating margin dipped 516 basis points sequentially due to the timing of content releases, and came in at $128m on forecast of $120m. Through the first half of 2017, our operating margin was 7.1%, putting us on track for our full year target of 7%, which we plan on growing in 2018 and beyond. Q2 EPS was on target at $0.15, as a greater than expected tax benefit offset a -$64 million non-cash unrealized loss from our euro bond (which was recognized in our P&L in interest and other income/expense). Content Last week, the Television Academy nominated 27 Netflix original programs with 91 Emmy nominations, nearly double last year’s tally. With five of the 14 total nominated best series contenders (Stranger \\u200b Things, The Crown, House of Cards, Master of None and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt), Netflix had the \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b most nominated series of any network. We are proud that even as we have increased our volume of originals across several genres, we continue to grow the recognition for the quality of those shows, including brand new series like Stranger Things and The Crown, which will have second season \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b premieres in 2017. The volume and breadth of our releases in Q2 exemplify our commitment to serve the desires of our diverse and growing audience. We premiered 14 new seasons of global Netflix original series, 13 original 2comedy specials, 6 original documentaries, 2 original documentary series, 9 original feature films and 7 seasons of original series for kids. You can track the dates of all of our upcoming launches here. \\u200b \\u200b We strive to be bold in our programming choices and financially disciplined, so we can keep being bold. \\u200b \\u200b Every show has passionate fans and committed talent striving for excellence. Sometimes those shows don’t attract as many viewers as we had hoped, compared to our other content. As much as we dislike ending a series early, it consoles us that it frees up investment for another new show, or two. We are programming to please our members and we keep that as our guiding light. We love it when we support a new series that has big impact like Stranger Things, Cable Girls, and 13 Reasons Why. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b As a global TV network, we also showcase local productions to a worldwide audience through our investments in non-English language originals. Our Spanish language original Ingobernable, starring Kate \\u200b \\u200b del Castillo, has been viewed by millions of members outside of Mexico. Similarly, in Q2, our first original from Spain, Las Chicas del Cable (Cable Girls), attracted significant viewership in the US and throughout \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b the entire Spanish-speaking world. We understand that our approach to films - debuting movies on Netflix first - is counter to Hollywood’s century-old windowing tradition. But just as we changed and reinvented the TV business by putting \\u200b \\u200b consumers first and making access to content more convenient, we believe internet TV can similarly reinvigorate the film business (as distinct from the theatrical business). This year we will release 40 features that range from big budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema. We are proud to produce films like Okja, War Machine and Bright, with big stars, distinctive directors and compelling \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b stories, as well as to introduce new voices like Macon Blair, whose directorial debut I Don’t Feel at Home \\u200b in This World Anymore, produced by Netflix, won the Dramatic Jury competition at the Sundance Film \\u200b Festival this year. Within a few weeks of the win, it premiered on Netflix everywhere, so that it could be enjoyed by fans, exactly when the world was talking about it. Product and Partnerships Since the early days of our streaming service, we have partnered with a wide variety of companies to make it easier for consumers to enjoy Netflix. Our partnerships began with consumer electronic companies and video game consoles and evolved to include smartphone makers, mobile operators and MVPDs and ISPs. In Q2, we announced a partnership with Altice/SFR France, whereby Netflix will be sold in a package with high speed Internet and TV services. These arrangements are mutually beneficial - our partners gain more customers and can upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while Netflix gains more reach and awareness with consumers across a market. We are likely to expand this approach as a complement to our direct-to-consumer primary approach. Competition The competition for entertainment time is always intense, but the silver lining is that the market is vast and diverse. YouTube is earning over a billion hours a day of consumers’ time with one type of entertainment, while we are earning over a billion hours a week with our type of entertainment. Linear TV is still huge, piracy still substantial, and there are thousands of firms and approaches around the world earning some fraction of consumers’ entertainment time. The entertainment market is so broad 3that we’ve grown from zero to over 50m streaming households in the US over the last 10 years, and yet HBO continues to increase its US subscriptions. It seems our growth just expands the market. The largely exclusive nature of each service’s content means that we are not direct substitutes for each other, but rather complements. In addition to the many SVOD players around the world (Blim, Globoplay, FilmStruck, Hooq, iflix, Stan, etc.) the large-cap tech companies, especially Amazon, are investing heavily in original and licensed content around the world. They join all the existing TV networks (BBC, AMC, NHK, etc.) of the world, and us, in bidding for great content. Creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment is pouring into content production around the world. We are all co-pioneers of internet TV and, together, we are replacing linear TV. The shift from linear TV to on-demand viewing is so big and there is so much leisure time, many internet TV services will be successful. The internet may not have been great for the music business due to piracy, but, wow, it is incredible for growing the video entertainment business around the world. Culture We recently crafted a major update on our culture description, to reflect our thinking as we have \\u200b \\u200b become more global. Our culture plays a major role in our continued evolution and success. Free Cashflow and Capital Structure Q2’17 free cash amounted to -$608 million vs. -$254 million in the year ago quarter and -$423 million in Q1’17. We anticipate free cash flow of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. With our content strategy paying off in strong member, revenue and profit growth, we think it’s wise to continue to invest. In continued success, we will deploy increased capital in content, particularly in owned originals, and, as we have said before, we expect to be FCF negative for many years. Since our FCF is driven by our content investment, particularly in self-produced originals, we wanted to provide some additional context on our content accounting at our investor relations website. \\u200b \\u200b We continue to debt finance our capital needs as we believe this reduces our weighted average cost of capital, resulting in a more efficient capital structure. In May, we completed a 1.3 billion euro bond offering. In addition to a small natural hedge to our growing European revenues, we are pleased to have broadened our access to capital markets beyond the US high yield market. Our euro bond may add some volatility to our net income as each quarter we remeasure the liability on our balance sheet based on the quarter end euro-to-dollar exchange rate. As a reminder, quarter-to-quarter remeasurement changes in this liability are reflected as a non-cash unrealized gain (loss) below operating income in “interest and other income/expense” in our P&L (-$64 million impact on net income in Q2’17). Summary It’s been twenty years since Netflix was founded and we still thrive on connecting people with great stories. Someday, we hope to entertain everyone. 4For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: April 2017, January 2017, October 2016, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b July 2016, April 2016, January, 2016, October 2015, July 2015. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b July 17th, 2017 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST Our video interview with Doug Mitchelson of UBS will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm PST today. \\u200b \\u200b Questions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to doug.mitchelson@ubs.com. \\u200b \\u200b IR Contact: PR Contact: Spencer Wang Jonathan Friedland Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations Chief Communications Officer 408 809-5360 310 734-2958 Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding the acquisition impact of our content slate; growth of internet video; content strategy, including future launches; future capital raises; impact of Euro bond raise on net income; partnership strategies; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 5including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company provides internal forecast numbers.

       "  \"We are growing nicely across the world and are on track to exceed $11 billion in revenue in 2017. Internet entertainment is delighting consumers, and we are staying at the forefront of this once-in-a-generation opportunity. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Global streaming revenue in Q3 rose 33% year over year, driven by a 24% increase in average paid memberships and 7% growth in ASP. Operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $209 million with our Q3 global operating margin of 7.0% putting us right on track to achieve our full year target of 7%. EPS of $0.29 included a pre-tax $51 million non-cash loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro bond (or $39 million after tax based on a 24% tax rate). Higher than expected excess tax benefit from stock based compensation benefited our tax rate by $5 million vs. our forecast. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We added a Q3-record 5.3 million memberships globally (up 49% year-over-year) as we continued to benefit from strong appetite for our original series and films, as well as the adoption of internet entertainment across the world. Relative to our guidance of 4.4 million net adds, we under-forecasted both US and international acquisition. Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29% versus last year. Domestic contribution margin in Q3 of 35.8% vs. 36.4% last year was below our forecast of 37.1% due primarily to the earlier-than-anticipated close of certain content deals. The foreign currency impact in the quarter was +$13 million and Q3 international revenue grew 54% year over year, excluding currency. F/X-neutral ASP increased 7.4% year over year. International contribution profit margin of 4.7% exceeded our 2.3% guidance, also due to the timing of content deals. For Q4, we forecast global net adds of 6.30m (1.25m in the US and 5.05m internationally) vs. 7.05m in the year ago quarter (which was our all-time high for quarterly net adds). We recently announced price adjustments in many markets to our HD and 4K video plans while keeping our SD plan mostly unchanged (still $7.99 in the US, for instance). Existing members will be notified and their prices will be adjusted on a rolling basis over the next few months. Increased revenue over time will help us grow our content offering and continue our global operating margin growth. We’ve been focused on growing global operating margin as our primary profitability metric since hitting our 2020 US contribution margin goal of 40% this past Q1. This allows us to avoid near term optimization for specific domestic or international contribution margin targets which could impede our long term growth. For instance, we anticipate our Q4’17 US contribution margin will be 34.4% (a decline both year-on-year and sequentially) as we boost our marketing investment against a growing content slate. We spend disproportionately in the US to generate media and influencer awareness for our programming which we believe, in turn, is an effective way to facilitate word of mouth globally. In our international segment, we are on track to generate positive contribution profit for the full year. As we move into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing operating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the rest of the world. 2Content Five years ago, we embarked on our original programming strategy and we’re very pleased with our progress in transforming Netflix from a service with not just second run content but also must-see new releases, like Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Fuller House, Making a \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Murderer, Narcos, The Crown and 13 Reasons Why, among many others. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b This quarter, we launched several new series such as the gritty drama Ozark and comedy Friends from \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b College by Nick Stoller as well as Marvel’s The Defenders and returning seasons of fan favorites like \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Narcos and Fuller House. We’re also making good strides on original films (as measured by member \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b viewing relative to our investment) with the debut of Death Note (based on the popular Japanese IP), \\u200b \\u200b Naked (a romantic comedy featuring Marlon Wayans) and To the Bone (an intense drama starring Lily \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Collins). Investors often ask us about continued access to content from diversified media companies. While we have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear. Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes. Our investment in Netflix originals is over a quarter of our total P&L content budget in 2017 and will continue to grow. With $17 billion in content commitments over the next several years and a growing library of owned content ($2.5 billion net book value at the end of the quarter), we remain quite comfortable with our ability to please our members around the world. We’ll spend $7-8 billion on content (on a P&L basis) in 2018. Just as we moved from second-run content to licensed originals and then to Netflix-produced originals, we are progressing even further up the value chain to work directly with talented content creators. In August, we announced an overall deal with Shonda Rhimes, the creator of global smash hits like Grey’s \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Anatomy, How to Get Away with Murder, Scandal, and others. We also acquired Millarworld, our one \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b M&A transaction in our 20 year history, the home of legendary comic book writer Mark Millar. Our goal is to work with the best creators in the world and own the underlying intellectual property so that we can continue to deliver amazing content to our members across the globe. In working with the best talent, we strive hard for awards recognition. At this year’s Primetime Emmys, we scored 20 wins out of 92 nominations, second only to HBO, spread across eight different titles. Competition Since 2013, we’ve taken the Long Term View that we’re in the early stages of the worldwide, \\u200b \\u200b multi-decade transition from linear TV to internet entertainment. Recently, it’s been unfolding right before our eyes: Disney announced plans to launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and its other \\u200b \\u200b brands, cable network owners are licensing their channels to virtual MVPDs like Hulu, YouTube, Sling TV, and DirecTV Now, CBS’ All Access is expanding internationally, Apple is reportedly planning on spending \\u200b \\u200b $1 billion on original content and Amazon is streaming NFL games while its Prime Video service has gone global. Facebook launched its Watch tab for original videos. \\u200b \\u200b 3At the same time, linear TV networks like MTV, A&E and WGN are cutting down on scripted series. Last \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b year, the number of original scripted series on linear TV (across broadcast, premium and basic cable) began to decrease as online services ramped up activity. It’s an exciting period and both media and technology companies see the same big opportunity as we do. We have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible to please our members by earning their viewing time and to stay ahead of the competition in the decades to come. Product and Partnerships Ironically, as linear networks move outside of the traditional bundle and into direct-to-consumer applications, we are working more closely than ever with MVPDs/ISPs and other distributors. Building on our Q2 partnership with SFR/Altice in France, where Netflix is sold in a package with high speed Internet and TV services, and an earlier, comparable partnership with Proximus of Belgium, this past quarter we announced the bundling of Netflix into T-Mobile’s ONE family plan. Our partners are enthusiastic about \\u200b \\u200b the response to these bundles as the excitement around our big content enhances their offerings. Our goal with all of our partnerships is to make it easy for members to sign up, pay and enjoy Netflix. We are pleased with the early results and we will continue pursuing these bundling opportunities as a complement to our core direct-to-consumer approach. Free Cashflow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$465 million vs. -$506 million last year and -$608 million in Q2’17. There is no change to our expectation for FCF of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. Negative FCF, despite growing operating income, is due to growth of our content spend, original content in particular, where we pay for the titles before consumers enjoy the content, and the asset is amortized by estimated viewing over time. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market as our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity. Summary This quarter, among other new offerings, we are releasing the second Netflix original series from David Fincher (Mindhunter), new seasons of our globally acclaimed franchises Stranger Things and The Crown, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b our first Italian and German original shows (Suburra and Dark) and our most ambitious film yet, Bright, \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer. We feel privileged to be working with great artists all over the world and to be able to bring their creations to a big, and growing, global audience. We’re delighted that consumers are embracing internet entertainment and are finding value and pleasure in the incredible stories offered by Netflix.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding growing revenues and our position within internet entertainment; price changes, increasing revenues, content spend and growing margin; marketing spend; investment in Asia and Rest of World markets; our original programming strategy; access to content, competition, and partnerships, including bundles; free cash flow and financing; domestic and international net, total and paid members; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms and partnerships for streaming our service; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is 5included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

       "\"We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than doubled global operating income. . Q4 Results Average paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in ASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5% margin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating margin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year. EPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items that affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which partially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform. In Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last year’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet entertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based. In the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3 million. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although contribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the marketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter. Internationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record for quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue and ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments in a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017 (4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution profit in our history. We took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected expense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger than expected member growth and the timing of international content spend. Forecast The guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net adds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally. As we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year 2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year. We believe our big investments in content are paying off. In 2017, average streaming hours per membership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more revenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018. 2Big hits like 13 Reasons Why, Stranger Things and Bright result from a combination of great content and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b great marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about $1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content, and we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll grow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018. Content Q4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of The Crown and Black \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Mirror as well as Stranger Things, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon. In the quarter, we \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b\\u200b also successfully launched new titles like the limited series Godless, Marvel’s The Punisher and \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Mindhunter (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s \\u200b amazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had three of the Top \\u200b 5 most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row. \\u200b Our largest investment in original films to date, Bright, a fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a \\u200b \\u200b major success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, Bright has become one of our \\u200b \\u200b most viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well as additional investment in original films. We’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of Club de \\u200b Cuervos as well as The Day I Met El Chapo, both of which are from Mexico; Suburra from Italy; and an \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b unscripted series from the UK, Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father. We also debuted Dark, our first \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b German original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for instance, Dark, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions \\u200b \\u200b of members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with attractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this initiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland, India, Korea and Japan. We are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall deals with Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy and Orange is the New Black and GLOW creator Jenji \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b Kohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over the world. Product and Partnerships We are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our mutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix, while our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of these types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche Telekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC removed the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net 3neutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the FCC’s action. Competition We have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend becomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On the commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with Apple Music or with iOS. Facebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their multi-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for entertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix. Traditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring most of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand and great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower end of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of content payments, which will now occur in 2018. Our operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is content. When we develop a title like Bright, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated \\u200b \\u200b membership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for self-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend will turn our business FCF positive. In the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re growing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had planned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018. Given our track record of content investments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the increased investments we are making in original content this year. We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of interest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to grow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt. High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick. 4Board of Directors We are pleased to add Rodolphe Belmer to our board of directors. Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+ \\u200b \\u200b Group in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing percentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our board. Summary Our goal is to entertain people. We are thrilled to be able to do that at great scale.

IR Contact: PR Contact: Spencer Wang Jonathan Friedland Vice President, Finance/IR & Corporate Development Chief Communications Officer 408 809-5360 310 734-2958 Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.

      "Q2 was better-than-expected on membership growth, and foreign exchange was worse-than-expected (stronger US dollar), resulting in 9% revenue growth (13% constant currency). Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product, content, and marketing as we’ve done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience. We’re in a position of strength given our $30 billion-plus in revenue, $6 billion in operating profit last year, growing free cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Our summary results and forecast are below.\n",
      "Q2 Results Revenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year (or 13% excluding a -$339 million foreign currency impact), driven by a 6% and 2% increase in average paid memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), ARM rose 7% year over year. The appreciation of the US dollar (USD) vs. most other currencies since our April earnings report was the primary reason for the variance to our revenue guidance forecast. We slightly under-forecasted global paid net adds in Q2 (-1.0m vs. -2.0m forecast and compared to +1.5m in the year ago quarter).  In APAC, revenue grew 23% year over year, excluding F/X. At over $900 million of revenue, APAC is approaching the size of our LATAM business. We added 1.1m paid memberships in the region (vs. 1.0m last Q2). ARM in APAC was -2% year over year on a F/X neutral basis, due to the impact from our price decrease in India last December as well as plan mix, which was partially offset by 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1higher ARM in Korea and Australia. Excluding India, APAC ARM grew 4% year over year on a constant currency basis.  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM increased 13% and 6% year over year, respectively, while paid net additions totaled -0.8m vs. 0.2m in the year ago quarter.  Revenue in LATAM grew 19% year over year excluding F/X and surpassed the $1 billion quarterly mark for the first time, helped by constant currency ARM growth of 15%. Paid memberships were flat sequentially (compared to 0.8m paid net adds in Q2’21).  In UCAN, ARM and revenue each increased 10% year over year, excluding the impact of F/X. Paid net adds were -1.3m vs. -0.4m in the year ago period. Retention improved over the course of the quarter and, while churn remains slightly elevated, it is now back near pre-price change levels. We’ve adjusted our cost structure for our current rate of revenue growth. This resulted in approximately $70 million of severance costs and an $80m non-cash impairment of certain real estate leases primarily related to rightsizing our office footprint. Excluding these items totaling $150 million, and the F/X impact of the stronger US dollar since our April report, operating profit and operating margin were slightly ahead of our guidance forecast. EPS of $3.20 vs. $2.97 a year ago exceeded our guidance forecast of $3.00 due to a $305 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” Our approximately $5 billion of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge against the Euro for net income, but doesn’t affect operating income. Year to date, our gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro debt is $467 million.\n",
      "Q3 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the current uncertain macro-economic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. The US dollar continues to strengthen meaningfully against most currencies at ahistoric pace, withthe Euro recently falling below the US dollarfor thefirst time in two decades, a significant headwind for all multinational US companies. We have high exposure to this unprecedented appreciation in the USD because nearly 60% of our revenue comes from outside the US and swings in F/X have a large flow through to operating profit as most of our expenses are in USD and don’t benefit from a stronger USD. Our Q3 revenue growth forecast of 5% translates into 12% year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Similarly, excluding the impact of currency, operating profit growth would be -3% year over year (vs our forecast decline of -29%) and operating margin would be 20% (vs our forecast of 16%). As we have written in the past, over the medium term, we intend to continue to adjust our business as appropriate given the relative strength of the USD to protect our operating margin and try to avoid immediate actions that we believe could be detrimental to the business. We forecast paid net adds for Q3 of +1.0m vs. 4.4m in the year ago quarter. We continue to expect full year 2022 operating margin of 19%-20%, excluding the unanticipated $150m of restructuring costs in Q2 2noted above and the material movement in F/X from January 2022, as our guidance was set based on F/X at that time (see ourQ4’21 letter).\n",
      "Content, Marketing, and Product Last quarter, we discussed our slowing revenue growth, which we believe is the result of connected TV adoption, account sharing, competition, and macro factors such as sluggish economic growth and the impacts of the war in Ukraine. We’ve now had more time to understand these issues, as well as how best to address them. First and foremost, we need to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix. This focus on improving our core service has served us well over the past 25 years, and remains our north star to drive continuous growth. It’s why we strive for an ever better content, marketing and product experience. Also as a pure play streaming business, we’re unencumbered by legacy revenue streams. This freedom means we can offer big movies direct-to-Netflix, without the need for extended or exclusive theatrical windows, and let members binge watch TV if they want, without having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. This focus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believe to be a significant long term business advantage. Our content offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of member tastes by providing an unmatched variety and quality of titles. Our Q2 slate is emblematic of this approach, headlined by season four of Stranger Things, which returned to tremendous fanreception and was a smash hit by all measures - including an outstanding drama Emmy nomination (along withOzarkseason 4 andSquid Game). In its first four weeks,Stranger Thingsseason four generated1.3 billion hours viewed2, making it our biggest season of English TV ever. Season four also re-ignited interest in past episodes with season one through three experiencing a greater than five-fold increase in viewing in the month after the release of season four (vs. the prior month). Season four ofStranger Thingsalso showcased theeffectiveness of our marketing strategy in driving conversation around our titles. When we deliver shows and movies that members are talking about in large numbers, we can influence pop culture, build passion for Netflix and create an experience that is differentiated and difficult-to-replicate. For example, the show catapulted the 1985 songRunning Up That Hillto thetop of the music charts. Metallicaalso enjoyed a return to the charts in the US and UK with their 1986 songMaster of Puppetsafter beingfeatured in the new season ofStranger Things. The cumulative Twitter volume forStranger Thingscontinuesto outpace bothObi-Wan KenobiandTop Gun Maverick, highlighting the big conversation aroundthis title and reinforcing that our binge versus one week at a time release strategy drives lots of “water cooler conversation.” 2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release for each title; since some titles have multiple premiere dates, whether weekly or in parts, we count the 28 days from each episode premiere date in each country. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 17, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 3Source: Twitter. We also delivered a wide variety of other English language series hits in Q2, including season three of The Umbrella Academy(284m view hours*) and seasonone ofThe Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama, which generated 277m hours viewed and has been renewed for a second season. We’ve also renewed the endearing, UK-produced young adult dramaHeartstopper(67m view hours) for another two seasons. In unscripted, audiences embraced season five ofSellingSunset, which recorded 95m view hours in its first four weeks, while the debut season of marriage reality showThe Ultimatumhad 148m view hours. In unscripted, we are also taking global formats and creating local versions. This quarter, we hadRhythm + Flow France, our rap competition show, which wasa big local success. The winner of season one, Fresh, was formerly unknown, working in a gym. But since his appearance on the show, he has become a star with his song CHOP that he performed in the finale hitting #1 on every streaming service in France. He was also invited to the Les Ardentes music festival where he performed for an audience of 15,000 people - another example of \"The Netflix Effect.\" We’re making good progress in film. The basketball dramaHustle(starring Adam Sandler) was our biggest Netflix movie in Q2 (186m hours viewed) and was loved by critics and audiences alike, followed by the comedySenior Year, starring Rebel Wilson,with 161m view hours. We continue to invest in animated features; building off our initial titles likeOver the MoonandBackto the Outback, we releasedThe Sea Beast(102m hoursviewed*) early in Q3 to audience and critical acclaim. Today, we announced that we will be acquiring leading animation studioAnimal Logic, with ~800 amazing people mostly in Sydney and Vancouver, which will help us accelerate the development of our animation production capabilities and reinforces our commitment to build a world-class animation studio. We’ve been partnering with Animal Logic for two years now, working onThe Magician’s Elephant (directed by Wendy Rogers) and the recently announcedThe Shrinking of the Treehorns(directed by Ron Howard). Together, we’ll create an animation studio that will produce some of our largest animated 4feature films. We’ll fund the purchase from our existing cash balance. The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals and we anticipate closing later this year. We’re building on our lead in non-English programming. We want Netflix to be relevant to audiences all over the globe and our local language titles are a differentiator for us. We focus first on telling authentic stories for local impact, but we see that great stories can travel everywhere. Another example of this In Q2 wasThe Marked Heart, a Colombian series, whichfound a global audience and ended up in the top 10 in 81 countries around the world by its second week. Similarly,The Takedown, a French film, wasin the top 10 in 91 countries around the world by its second week, again showing the power of an authentic story and our ability to serve those stories - with subtitling, dubbing, and personalized discovery - for members to enjoy around the world. While we always have room to improve, we’re very pleased with how far we’ve come in providing so much satisfaction and enjoyment to our members. For instance, in the US, which is one of the most competitive markets in the world, we drewmore TVviewing time than any other outletduring the 2021-22 TV season (see chart below), nearly matching the combined total of the two most watched broadcast networks. And, as Nielsen will announce on Thursday, our share of US TV viewing reached an all-time high of 7.7% in June (vs. 6.6% in June 2021), demonstrating our ability to grow our engagement share as we continue to improve our service. Since our launch of a small selection of licensed mobile games last November, we’ve released new games every few weeks, with the portfolio growing to the current total of 24. The games are all intended to be accessible to broad audiences, and span several genres and categories, including racing with Asphalt Xtreme, the digital version of the irreverentcard gameExploding Kittens, zombies inInto the Dead 2and the knitting for cats inKnittens. We’vehad millions of our members play games through the service and we are learning about what games work for different audiences. We’re adapting our 5licensing and partner-based development activities in response to these learnings. We’ve also acquired three games studios (Night School Studios, Boss Fight Studios, and Next Games) which gives us a range of expertise in multiple geographies to accelerate the buildout of our internal development capacity. We are building a solid pipeline of new games that will launch over the next several years and are excited to see our members engage with these titles.\n",
      "Near Term Focus In the near term, a key priority to re-accelerate revenue growth is to evolve and improve our monetization. In the early days of streaming, we kept our pricing very simple with just one plan level. In 2014, we introduced three price tiers to better segment demand. Going forward, we will focus on better monetizing usage through both continued optimization of our pricing and tiering structures as well as the addition of a new, lower-priced ad-supported tier. Advertising Our lower priced advertising-supported offering will complementour existing plans, which will remain ad-free. Our global ARM has grown at a 5% compoundannual rate from 2013 to 2021, so it makes sense now to give consumers a choice for a lower priced option with advertisements, if they desire it. We recentlyannouncedMicrosoft as our technologyand sales partner and we’re targeting to launch this tier around the early part of 2023. They are investing heavily to expand their multi-billion advertising business into premium television video, and we are thrilled to be working with such a strong global partner. We’re excited by the opportunity given the combination of our very engaged audience and high quality content, which we think will attract premium CPMs from brand advertisers. We’ll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant. Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So, our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one. Over time, our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that’s more seamless and relevant for consumers, and more effective for our advertising partners. While it will take some time to grow our member base for the ad tier and the associated ad revenues, over the long run, we think advertising can enable substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth (through ad revenues). Paid Sharing We’re in the early stages of working to monetize the 100m+ households that are currently enjoying, but not directly paying for, Netflix. We know this will be a change for our members. As such, we have launchedtwo different approachesin Latin Americato learn more. Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023. We’re encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America. 6Simplicity At Netflix, focus remains very important to us. These initiatives - paid sharing and advertising - do introduce some additional complexity, but our approach has always been tokeep our business model as simple as possible within the context of our growth objectives. In this vein, these initiatives are similar to expanding into originals, launching our service across the world, and building our own studio, each of which also increased complexity but are natural extensions intended to enhance our existing business.\n",
      "F/X Neutral Operating Margin Disclosure To provide additional transparency around our operating margin, we’ll now disclose our year-to-date (YTD) operating margin based on F/X ratesat the beginningof each year. This will allow investors to see how our operating margin is tracking against our target (which was set in January of 2022 based on F/X rates at that time), absent intra-year fluctuations in F/X (which have beensubstantial in 2022). As can be seen from the table below, F/X-driven changes to our revenue have a high flow through to operating income (the operating profit impact ranges from ~75% to 80%+ of the revenue impact). This is because the bulk of our expenses don’t change with F/X fluctuations.  Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year. YTD 2022 through June 30, 2022. Note: There were no adjustments to content amortization for the purposes of this calculation, as titles are amortized at the historical blended rate at the time of capitalization. 7Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was +$103 million vs. -$64 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)3in the quarter totaled+$13 million, compared with -$175 million in Q2’21. Cash declined $190m sequentially, primarily due to our Next Games acquisition ($69m) and the F/X impact on cash ($145m). As we’ve discussed previously, we are now self-funding. For the full year 2022, we expect FCF to be approximately +$1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars (assuming no material further movements in F/X). We expect annual positive FCF going forward (with substantial growth in FCF in 2023 vs. 2022) due to our increasing revenue, solid profitability, and the successful multi-year evolution of our content model. We’re now more than a decade into transforming our service from licensed second run content to mostly Netflix originals - including more than five years into building out our internal studio to produce the majority of our original titles (60% of our net content assets on our balance sheet are Netflix-produced). We’re now through the most cash-intensive part of that transition. As a result, our cash content spend-to-content amortization expense ratio peaked at 1.6x (along with peak negative FCF of -$3.3B in 2019) and is expected to be about 1.2-1.3x in 2022 and to decline going forward, based on our current plans, which assume no material expansion into new content categories in ‘23. 2022 estimate based on the midpoint of 1.2x-1.3x range. 3For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 8Gross debt at quarter end amounted to $14.3 billion, within our targeted range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $5.8 billion, net debt totaled $8.5 billion, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA4. Our capital structure policy remains unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (eg, about $5.3 billion based on Q2 revenue). After meeting those needs, our intent is to return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases.\n",
      "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) At this year’s annual meeting in June, shareholders approved proposals to declassify our board, remove supermajority voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings. We’ve also changed the voting standard for our directors to simple majority in uncontested elections. Our governance structure is now similar to other large cap company governance structures. With more than one billion people living with some form of disability, we want to ensure Netflix is as accessible as possible. In Q2, we announced that we are expanding the availability of audio descriptions and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing to a total of 20 languages - work that recently won the prestigiousDr. Jacob Bolotin Award. We’ve also introducednew badges for our titles that have audio descriptions and subtitles on laptop and iOS, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first.\n",
      "Summary Reaccelerating our revenue growth is a big challenge. But we’ve been through hard times before. We’ve built this company to be flexible and adaptable and this will be a great test for us and our high performance culture. We’re fortunate to be in a position of strength as the leader in streaming entertainment by all metrics (revenue, engagement, subscribers, profit and free cash flow). We’re confident and optimistic about the future.\n"
