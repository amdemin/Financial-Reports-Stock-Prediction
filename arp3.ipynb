       "  'content': \" \\nJuly 17, 2017\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders\\n \\n \\nFor Q2, revenue and operating income were right on forecast. Our streaming membership grew more\\n \\nthan expected, from 99m to 104m, due to our amazing content. We also crossed the symbolic\\n \\nmilestones of 100m members and more international than domestic members. It was a good quarter.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n \\n \\nQ2 Results and Q3 Forecast\\n \\nOur quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q2,\\n \\nwe underestimated the popularity of our strong slate of content which led to higher-than-expected\\n \\nacquisition across all major territories. As a result, global net adds totaled a Q2-record 5.2 million (vs.\\n \\nforecast of 3.2m) and increased 5% sequentially, bucking historical seasonal patterns. For the first six\\n \\nmonths of 2017, net adds are up 21% year-on-year to 10.2m.\\n \\nOur Q3 guidance assumes much of this momentum will continue but we are cognizant of the lessons of\\n \\nprior quarters when we over-forecasted and there was lumpiness in net adds, likely due to demand\\n \\nbeing pulled forward (into Q2 in this case).\\n \\n \\nDomestic net additions of 1.1m represented the highest level of Q2 net adds since the second quarter of\\n \\n2011. For Q3’17, we project that we will add 0.75m US members, compared with 0.37m in Q3’16, which\\n \\nwas impacted by un-grandfathering.\\n \\n \\nOur international segment now accounts for 50.1% of our total membership base. International revenue\\n \\nrose 57% year over year, excluding a -$23 million impact from foreign exchange, while international ASP\\n \\ngrew 10% year over year on a F/X neutral basis. International contribution profit of -$13 million vs. -$69\\n \\nmillion was better than our -$28 million forecast due primarily to higher-than-forecasted paid members.\\n \\n \\nWe’re forecasting Q3’17 international net adds of 3.65 million. We are making good progress with our\\n \\ninternational expansion as improving profitability in our earlier international markets helps fund\\n \\nsignificant investment in our newer territories. As a result, we expect\\n\\u200b\\n positive international\\n \\ncontribution profit for the full year 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, at current F/X exchange rates. This would mark the first ever\\n \\nannual contribution profit from our international segment.\\n \\nFor Q2, global streaming revenue was within 1% of our projection.  As expected, operating margin\\n \\ndipped 516 basis points sequentially due to the timing of content releases, and came in at $128m on\\n \\nforecast of $120m. Through the first half of 2017, our operating margin was 7.1%, putting us on track for\\n \\nour full year target of 7%, which we plan on growing in 2018 and beyond. Q2 EPS was on target at $0.15,\\n \\nas a greater than expected tax benefit offset a -$64 million non-cash unrealized loss from our euro bond\\n \\n(which was recognized in our P&L in interest and other income/expense).\\n \\nContent\\n \\nLast week, the Television Academy nominated 27 Netflix original programs with 91 Emmy nominations,\\n \\nnearly double last year’s tally. With five of the 14 total nominated best series contenders (\\n\\u200b\\nStranger\\n \\nThings, The Crown, House of Cards, Master of None \\n\\u200b\\nand\\n\\u200b\\n Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\\n\\u200b\\n), Netflix had the\\n \\nmost nominated series of any network. We are proud that even as we have increased our volume of\\n \\noriginals across several genres, we continue to grow the recognition for the quality of those shows,\\n \\nincluding brand new series like \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n\\u200b\\n The Crown\\n\\u200b\\n, which will have second season\\n \\npremieres in 2017.\\n \\n \\nThe volume and breadth of our releases in Q2 exemplify our commitment to serve the desires of our\\n \\ndiverse and growing audience. We premiered 14 new seasons of global Netflix original series, 13 original\\n \\n2\\n \\n \\ncomedy specials, 6 original documentaries, 2 original documentary series, 9 original feature films and 7\\n \\nseasons of original series for kids.  You can track the dates of all of our upcoming launches \\n\\u200b\\nhere\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\nWe strive to be bold in our programming choices \\n\\u200b\\nand\\n\\u200b\\n financially disciplined, so we can keep being bold.\\n \\nEvery show has passionate fans and committed talent striving for excellence. Sometimes those shows\\n \\ndon’t attract as many viewers as we had hoped, compared to our other content.  As much as we dislike\\n \\nending a series early, it consoles us that it frees up investment for another new show, or two.  We are\\n \\nprogramming to please our members and we keep that as our guiding light. We love it when we support\\n \\na new series that has big impact like \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things, Cable Girls,\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\n13 Reasons Why\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nAs a global TV network, we also showcase local productions to a worldwide audience through our\\n \\ninvestments in non-English language originals. Our Spanish language original \\n\\u200b\\nIngobernable\\n\\u200b\\n, starring Kate\\n \\ndel Castillo, has been viewed by millions of members outside of Mexico. Similarly, in Q2, our first original\\n \\nfrom Spain, \\n\\u200b\\nLas Chicas del Cable\\n\\u200b\\n (\\n\\u200b\\nCable Girls\\n\\u200b\\n), attracted significant viewership in the US and throughout\\n \\nthe entire Spanish-speaking world.\\n \\nWe understand that our approach to films - debuting movies on Netflix first - is counter to Hollywood’s\\n \\ncentury-old windowing \\n\\u200b\\ntradition\\n\\u200b\\n. But just as we changed and reinvented the TV business by putting\\n \\nconsumers first and making access to content more convenient, we believe internet TV can similarly\\n \\nreinvigorate the film business (as distinct from the theatrical business). This year we will release 40\\n \\nfeatures that range from big budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema.  We are proud to\\n \\nproduce films like \\n\\u200b\\nOkja\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nWar Machine\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nBright,\\n\\u200b\\n with big stars, distinctive directors and compelling\\n \\nstories, as well as to introduce new voices like Macon Blair, whose directorial debut \\n\\u200b\\nI Don’t Feel at Home\\n \\nin This World Anymore\\n\\u200b\\n, produced by Netflix, won the Dramatic Jury competition at the Sundance Film\\n \\nFestival this year. Within a few weeks of the win, it premiered on Netflix everywhere, so that it could be\\n \\nenjoyed by fans, exactly when the world was talking about it.\\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nSince the early days of our streaming service, we have partnered with a wide variety of companies to\\n \\nmake it easier for consumers to enjoy Netflix. Our partnerships began with consumer electronic\\n \\ncompanies and video game consoles and evolved to include smartphone makers, mobile operators and\\n \\nMVPDs and ISPs. In Q2, we announced a partnership with Altice/SFR France, whereby Netflix will be sold\\n \\nin a package with high speed Internet and TV services. These arrangements are mutually beneficial - our\\n \\npartners gain more customers and can upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while Netflix\\n \\ngains more reach and awareness with consumers across a market. We are likely to expand this approach\\n \\nas a complement to our direct-to-consumer primary approach.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nThe competition for entertainment time is always intense, but the silver lining is that the market is vast\\n \\nand diverse. YouTube is earning over a billion hours a day of consumers’ time with one type of\\n \\nentertainment, while we are earning over a billion hours a week with our type of entertainment. Linear\\n \\nTV is still huge, piracy still substantial, and there are thousands of firms and approaches around the\\n \\nworld earning some fraction of consumers’ entertainment time. The entertainment market is so broad\\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nthat we’ve grown from zero to over 50m streaming households in the US over the last 10 years, and yet\\n \\nHBO continues to increase its US subscriptions. It seems our growth just expands the market. The largely\\n \\nexclusive nature of each service’s content means that we are not direct substitutes for each other, but\\n \\nrather complements.\\n \\n \\nIn addition to the many SVOD players around the world (Blim, Globoplay, FilmStruck, Hooq, iflix, Stan,\\n \\netc.) the large-cap tech companies, especially Amazon, are investing heavily in original and licensed\\n \\ncontent around the world. They join all the existing TV networks (BBC, AMC, NHK, etc.) of the world, and\\n \\nus, in bidding for great content. Creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment\\n \\nis pouring into content production around the world.\\n \\n \\nWe are all co-pioneers of internet TV and, together, we are replacing linear TV. The shift from linear TV\\n \\nto on-demand viewing is so big and there is so much leisure time, many internet TV services will be\\n \\nsuccessful. The internet may not have been great for the music business due to piracy, but, wow, it is\\n \\nincredible for growing the video entertainment business around the world.\\n \\n \\nCulture\\n \\nWe recently crafted a major update on our \\n\\u200b\\nculture description\\n\\u200b\\n, to reflect our thinking as we have\\n \\nbecome more global. Our culture plays a major role in our continued evolution and success.\\n \\n \\n \\nFree Cashflow and Capital Structure\\n \\nQ2’17 free cash amounted to -$608 million vs. -$254 million in the year ago quarter and -$423 million in\\n \\nQ1’17. We anticipate free cash flow of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. With our content\\n \\nstrategy paying off in strong member, revenue and profit growth, we think it’s wise to continue to\\n \\ninvest. In continued success, we will deploy increased capital in content, particularly in owned originals,\\n \\nand, as we have said before, we expect to be FCF negative for many years. Since our FCF is driven by our\\n \\ncontent investment, particularly in self-produced originals, we wanted to provide some additional\\n \\ncontext on our content accounting at our \\n\\u200b\\ninvestor relations\\n\\u200b\\n website.\\n \\n \\nWe continue to debt finance our capital needs as we believe this reduces our weighted average cost of\\n \\ncapital, resulting in a more efficient capital structure. In May, we completed a 1.3 billion euro bond\\n \\noffering. In addition to a small natural hedge to our growing European revenues, we are pleased to have\\n \\nbroadened our access to capital markets beyond the US high yield market. Our euro bond may add some\\n \\nvolatility to our net income as each quarter we remeasure the liability on our balance sheet based on\\n \\nthe quarter end euro-to-dollar exchange rate. As a reminder, quarter-to-quarter remeasurement\\n \\nchanges in this liability are reflected as a non-cash unrealized gain (loss) below operating income in\\n \\n“interest and other income/expense” in our P&L (-$64 million impact on net income in Q2’17).\\n \\n \\nSummary\\n \\nIt’s been twenty years since Netflix was founded and we still thrive on connecting people with great\\n \\nstories. Someday, we hope to entertain everyone.\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2016\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJuly 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary, 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2015\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2015\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nJuly 17th, 2017 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST\\n \\nOur video interview with Doug Mitchelson of UBS will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm PST today.\\n \\nQuestions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to \\n\\u200b\\ndoug.mitchelson@ubs.com\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIR Contact:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSpencer Wang\\n \\n  Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations\\n \\n  408 809-5360\\n \\n \\n \\nPR Contact:\\n \\n \\nJonathan Friedland\\n \\nChief Communications Officer\\n \\n \\n \\n310 734-2958\\n \\n \\n \\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free\\n \\ncash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity\\n \\nmetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to\\n \\nrepay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in\\n \\noperations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nshould be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,\\n \\ndiluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures\\n \\nprepared in accordance with GAAP.

We finished the quarter withover 209m paid memberships, slightly ahead of ourforecast. COVID has created some lumpiness in ourmembership growth (higher growth in 2020, slowergrowth this year), which is working its way through.We continue to focus on improving our service forour members and bringing them the best stories fromaround the world. Our summary results andforecast for Q3 are below.\\nQ2 R esults and Q3 F orecast\\nRevenue growth was driven by an 11% increase in averagepaid streaming memberships and 8% growthin average revenue per membership (ARM). ARM rose4%, excluding a foreign exchange (FX) impact of1\\n+$277m. Operating margin of 25.2% expanded 3 percentagepoints compared with the year ago quarter.EPS of $2.97 vs. $1.59 a year ago included a $63mnon-cash unrealized loss from FX remeasurement onour Euro denominated debt.\\nThe pandemic has created unusual choppiness in ourgrowth and distorts year-over-year comparisons asacquisition and engagement per member household spikedin the early months of COVID. In Q2’21, ourengagement per member household was, as expected,down vs. those unprecedented levels but was stillup 17% compared with a more comparable Q2’19. Similarly,retention continues to be strong and betterthan pre-COVID Q2’19 levels, even as average revenueper membership has grown 8% over this two-year\\n1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesalestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nperiod, demonstrating how much our members value Netflix and that as we improve our service we cancharge a bit more.\\nWe added 1.5m paid memberships in Q2, slightly aheadof our 1.0m guidance forecast. The APAC regionrepresented about two-thirds of our global paid net adds in the quarter. As expected, Q2 paidmemberships in the UCAN region were slightly downsequentially (-0.4m paid net adds). We believe ourlarge membership base in UCAN coupled with a seasonallysmaller quarter for acquisition is the mainreason for this dynamic. This is similar to what weexperienced in Q2’19 when our UCAN paid net addswere -0.1m; since then we’ve added nearly 7.5m paidnet adds in UCAN.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report.For Q3’21, we forecast paid net additions of 3.5mvs. 2.2m in the prior year period. If we achieve ourforecast, we will have added more than 54m paid netadds over the past 24 months or 27m on anannualized basis over that time period, which is consistentwith our pre-COVID annual rate of netadditions. We forecast that ARM will grow roughly5% year over year on a FX neutral basis in Q3’21.\\nWe continue to target a 20% operating margin for thefull year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. After our big globallaunch in January 2016, we committed to steadily growingour operating margin thereafter at an averagerate of three percentage points per year over anyfew-year period. Some years we’ll be a little over(likein 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021).Assuming we achieve our margin target this year,wewill have quintupled our operating margin in the lastfive years and are tracking ahead of this averageannual three percentage point pace.\\n2\\nWith revenue and margin both increasing, our operatingprofit dollars have risen dramatically as well(even as we have been investing heavily), from about$100 million per quarter in 2016 to nearly $2billion per quarter so far in 2021. Our belief isthat as we steadily improve our service to betterpleaseour members, this will lead to continued growth inour membership base, ARM, revenue, operatingmargin and profit dollars.\\nContent\\nWe launched our first original scripted TV seriesin 2012 and we’ve since expanded our originalprogramming effort to many additional categories,from all over the world. Our goal is to be everyone’sfirst choice for entertainment because of the varietyand quality of our titles. And despite theCOVID-related production delays in 2020, we were ableto deliver an exciting portfolio of titles in Q2’21that exemplify this ambition.\\nFor example,Shadow and Bone, a fantasy series basedon the popularGrishaverse book series, proved tobe very popular with our members. Over 55m memberhouseholds chose to watch this show in its first28 days and we’ve renewed it for a second season.Sweet Tooth, based on the beloved DC comic, wasanother hit series with 60m member households choosingthis title in its first four weeks.\\nOur expansion into non-fiction series is going well.This past quarter, standout unscripted titles includeseason two of dating showToo Hot to Handleand socialexperiment reality programThe Circle(anestimated 29m and 14m, respectively, chose to watchin the first 28 days) as well as the true crimedocu-seriesThe Sons of Sam(19m). We’re buildingout some of these unscripted titles with localversions of the same formats. As one example,TooHot to Handle: BrazilandToo Hot to Handle: Latinowill be launching later in July and September, respectively,to serve our LATAM region.\\n3\\nWe’re also quickly growing both our live action and animated original film offering, with severalimpactful titles in Q2. Zack Snyder’sArmy of the Deadwas a blockbuster as 75m member householdschose to watch this action packed zombie spectaclein its first 28 days of release. As an extensiontoArmy of the Dead, a prequel,Army of Thieves, willbe released in Q4’21 along with a spinoff anime serieslater in 2022.Fatherhood, a dramedy starring KevinHart, was another hit, drawing an estimated 74mmember households in its first 28 days. And Q2 alsofeatured our biggest Netflix animated film to datewith 53m member households choosing to watchThe Mitchellsvs. The Machines.\\nLast week, Netflix series and specials received 129Emmy nominations. With 24 nominations,The Crowntied for the most nominated series.Bridgertonwith12 nominations was also nominated for Best Dramaseries whileThe Queen’s Gambitreceived 18 nominationsincluding Best Limited Series.Cobra Kai,EmilyIn Parisand the finale season ofThe Kominsky Methodwere all nominated for Best Comedy series.Beyond this acclaim, these are also among our popularseries on Netflix.\\nOur non-English content investments are growing bothin scope and impact. Our P&L content expensefor this content category has more than doubled inthe past two years. Illustrating how great storiescancome from anywhere and be loved everywhere, part twoofLupinfrom France was our largestnon-English title in the quarter with 54m member householdschoosing this title in its first four weeks.Season four ofElitefrom Spain drew 37m member householdsin its first 28 days, while season two ofWho Killed Sara?built on the success of the firstseason with 34m households choosing the latestinstallment of this gripping thriller from Mexico.\\nAs discussed in previous letters, COVID-related productiondelays in 2020 have led to a lighter first half of2021 slate that will build through the course of theyear. In the first six months of 2021, contentamortization grew only 9% year over year (as comparedto 17% in FY20). COVID and its variants makepredicting the future hard, but with productions largelyrunning smoothly so far, we’re optimistic in ourability to deliver a strong second half slate. Throughthe first half of 2021 we’ve already spent $8 billionin cash on content (up 41% yr-over-yr and 1.4x ourcontent amortization) and we expect contentamortization to be around $12 billion for the fullyear (+12% year over year). Our Q3 slate will includenew seasons of fan favoritesLa Casa de Papel(akaMoney Heist),Sex Education, Virgin RiverandNeverHave I Everas well as live action films includingSweet Girl(starring Jason Momoa),Kissing Booth3, andKate(starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the animatedfeature filmVivo, featuring all-new songs fromLin-Manuel Miranda.\\nWe’re also in the early stages of further expandinginto games, building on our earlier efforts aroundinteractivity (eg,Black Mirror Bandersnatch) andourStranger Thingsgames. We view gaming as anothernew content category for us, similar to our expansioninto original films, animation and unscripted TV.Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscriptionat no additional cost similar to films and series.Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games formobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our moviesand TV series offering and we expect a long runwayof increasing investment and growth across all ofourexisting content categories, but since we are nearlya decade into our push into original programming,we think the time is right to learn more about howour members value games.\\nProduct\\n4\\nWe’re constantly innovating across a broad range of areas to improve the viewing experience and betterserve our members. That’s why this quarter we globallylaunchedPlay Somethingon television, ournewfeaturethat lets Netflix do the work when you don’tfeel like choosing what to watch. Recognizing thatbroadband quality and cost varies around the world,we also improved the Netflix download experienceto enable you to start watching a show or film evenif it hasn’t finished downloading.

Like in our other markets,this plan complements our existing three tiers ofservice. In the five markets where we had previouslylaunched a mobile-only plan, we have found thatthe mobile only plan has been an effective way tointroduce more consumers to Netflix while beingroughly revenue neutral as the lower average revenueper membership is offset by incrementalacquisition and generally better retention.\\nCompe tition\\nWe are still very much in the early days of the transitionfrom linear to on-demand consumption ofentertainment. Streaming represents just 27% of USTV screen time, compared with 63% for lineartelevision, according to Nielsen. Based on this samestudy, Nielsen estimates that we are just 7% of USTV screen time. Considering that we are less maturein other countries and that this excludes mobilescreens (where we believe our share of engagementis even lower), we are confident that we have a longrunway for growth. As we improve our service, ourgoal is to continue to increase our share of screentime in the US and around the world.\\n5\\nShare of Total US TV Time, June 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+)\\nSource: Nielsen.\\nThe planned combination of Warner Media Group andDiscovery and Amazon’s pending acquisition ofMGM are examples of the ongoing industry consolidationas firms adapt to a world where streamingsupplants linear TV. The industry has consolidatedmaterially over the years (Time Warner/AT&T,Viacom/CBS, Discovery/Scripps, Disney/Fox, Comcast/NBCU/Sky,etc.) and we don’t believe thisconsolidation has affected our growth much, if atall. While we are continually evaluating opportunities,we don’t view any assets as “must-have” and we haven’tyet found any large scale ones to be sufficientlycompelling to act upon.\\nIn the race to entertain consumers around the world,we continue to compete for screen time with abroad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok(to name just a few). But, we are mostlycompeting with ourselves to improve our service asfast as we can. If we can do that, we’re confidentwecan maintain our strong position and continue to grownicely as we have been over the past two-plusdecades.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nIn Q2, net cash generated by operating activitieswas -$64 million vs. $1 billion in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)for the quarter was-$175 million vs. $899 million in Q2‘20. FCF in lastyear’s2\\nQ2 benefited from COVID-related production shutdowns.We are still expecting full year 2021 free cashflow to be approximately break even. As we discussedpreviously, we believe we no longer have a needto raise external financing to fund our day-to-dayoperations.\\n2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cashprovided by (used in) operating activities, pleaserefer to thereconciliation in tabular form on the attached unauditedfinancial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n6\\nDuring Q2, we increased our revolving credit facility (which remains undrawn) to $1 billion from $750million and extended the maturity from 2024 to 2026.We also repurchased 1m shares for $500 million(at an average per share price of about $500) underour $5 billion share authorization. Our main priorityis to invest in the organic growth of our business while maintaining strong liquidity and retainingfinancial flexibility for strategic investments. Ourgrowing operating profit allows us to complementthispriority with a return of capital to shareholders.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nIn June, the independent sustainability think tankThe Carbon Trustpublished awhite paperexaminingthe carbon impact of video streaming.Key findingsof the work include:\\n●The average carbon footprint for Europe per hour ofvideo streaming is approximately 55gCO2e,equivalent to driving 250 metres in an average petrolcar.\\n●Devices (TVs, laptops/PCs, smartphones, tablets) makeup the largest portion of carbonemissions from streaming (over 50%), compared to othercomponents like energy from datacenters or networks. Good news: Devices are gettingmore efficient over time and total deviceusage is fairly constant (with Netflix gaining sharefrom linear).\\n●Changing resolutions and other viewing settings werefound to result in only a very small changein the carbon impact. Changing from standard definitionto 4K resolution grows transmissionemissions from just under 1g CO2e/hour to just over1g CO2e/hour.\\n●As demand for streaming and other internet servicesincreases, the carbon intensity of theseservices will decrease over time. This is due to (1)networking equipment becoming lessenergy-intensive with technological advances, and(2) increased use of renewable electricity.\\nAs a reminder, our ESG-related information can befound on ourIR website.\\nReference\\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investorletters are:April 2021,January 2021,October 2020,July 2020,April 2020,January 2020,October 2019,July 2019.\\n7\\nRegional Br eakdown\\nJuly 20, 2021 Earnings Interview, 3pm PT\\nOur video interview with Nidhi Gupta of Fidelity Management& Research, Co. will be onyoutube/netflixirat 3pm PT today.

Management believes that free cash flowis an important liquidity metric because it measures,during a given period, the amount of cash generatedthat is available to repay debt obligations, makestrategic acquisitions and investments and for certainother activities like stock repurchases. However,this non-GAAP financial measure should be consideredin addition to, not as a substitute for or superiorto, net income, operating income, diluted earningsper share and net cash provided by (used in)operating activities, or other financial measuresprepared in accordance with GAAP.

Operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $209 million\\n \\nwith our Q3 global operating margin of 7.0% putting us right on track to achieve our full year target of\\n \\n7%. EPS of $0.29 included a pre-tax $51 million non-cash loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro\\n \\nbond (or $39 million after tax based on a 24% tax rate). Higher than expected excess tax benefit from\\n \\nstock based compensation benefited our tax rate by $5 million vs. our forecast. As a reminder, the\\n \\nquarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.\\n \\n \\nWe added a Q3-record 5.3 million memberships globally (up 49% year-over-year) as we continued to\\n \\nbenefit from strong appetite for our original series and films, as well as the adoption of internet\\n \\nentertainment across the world. Relative to our guidance of 4.4 million net adds, we under-forecasted\\n \\nboth US and international acquisition. Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29% versus last year.\\n \\n \\nDomestic contribution margin in Q3 of 35.8% vs. 36.4% last year was below our forecast of 37.1% due\\n \\nprimarily to the earlier-than-anticipated close of certain content deals. The foreign currency impact in\\n \\nthe quarter was +$13 million and  Q3 international revenue grew 54% year over year, excluding\\n \\ncurrency. F/X-neutral ASP increased 7.4% year over year. International contribution profit margin of\\n \\n4.7% exceeded our 2.3% guidance, also due to the timing of content deals.\\n \\n \\nFor Q4, we forecast global net adds of 6.30m (1.25m in the US and 5.05m internationally) vs. 7.05m in\\n \\nthe year ago quarter (which was our all-time high for quarterly net adds). We recently announced price\\n \\nadjustments in many markets to our HD and 4K video plans while keeping our SD plan mostly unchanged\\n \\n(still $7.99 in the US, for instance). Existing members will be notified and their prices will be adjusted on\\n \\na rolling basis over the next few months. Increased revenue over time will help us grow our content\\n \\noffering and continue our global operating margin growth.\\n \\n \\nWe’ve been focused on growing global operating margin as our primary profitability metric since hitting\\n \\nour 2020 US contribution margin goal of 40% this past Q1. This allows us to avoid near term\\n \\noptimization for specific domestic or international contribution margin targets which could impede our\\n \\nlong term growth. For instance, we anticipate our Q4’17 US contribution margin will be 34.4% (a decline\\n \\nboth year-on-year and sequentially) as we boost our marketing investment against a growing content\\n \\nslate. We spend disproportionately in the US to generate media and influencer awareness for our\\n \\nprogramming which we believe, in turn, is an effective way to facilitate word of mouth globally. In our\\n \\ninternational segment, we are on track to generate positive contribution profit for the full year. As we\\n \\nmove into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing\\n \\noperating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the\\n \\nrest of the world.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nContent\\n \\nFive years ago, we embarked on our original programming strategy and we’re very pleased with our\\n \\nprogress in transforming Netflix from a service with not just second run content but also must-see new\\n \\nreleases, like \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOrange is the New Black\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nHouse of Cards, Fuller House, Making a\\n \\nMurderer, Narcos, The Crown\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\n13 Reasons Why\\n\\u200b\\n, among many others.\\n \\n \\nThis quarter, we launched several new series such as the gritty drama \\n\\u200b\\nOzark\\n\\u200b\\n and comedy \\n\\u200b\\nFriends from\\n \\nCollege\\n\\u200b\\n by Nick Stoller as well as \\n\\u200b\\nMarvel’s The Defenders \\n\\u200b\\nand returning seasons of fan favorites like\\n \\nNarcos \\n\\u200b\\nand \\n\\u200b\\nFuller House\\n\\u200b\\n. We’re also making good strides on original films (as measured by member\\n \\nviewing relative to our investment) with the debut of \\n\\u200b\\nDeath Note\\n\\u200b\\n (based on the popular Japanese IP),\\n \\nNaked\\n\\u200b\\n (a romantic comedy featuring Marlon Wayans) and \\n\\u200b\\nTo the Bone\\n\\u200b\\n (an intense drama starring Lily\\n \\nCollins).\\n \\n \\nInvestors often ask us about continued access to content from diversified media companies.  While we\\n \\nhave multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term\\n \\ntrends are clear. Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around\\n \\nNetflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes. Our\\n \\ninvestment in Netflix originals is over a quarter of our total P&L content budget in 2017 and will\\n \\ncontinue to grow.  With $17 billion in content commitments over the next several years and a growing\\n \\nlibrary of owned content ($2.5 billion net book value at the end of the quarter), we remain quite\\n \\ncomfortable with our ability to please our members around the world. We’ll spend $7-8 billion on\\n \\ncontent (on a P&L basis) in 2018.\\n \\n \\nJust as we moved from second-run content to licensed originals and then to Netflix-produced originals,\\n \\nwe are progressing even further up the value chain to work directly with talented content creators. In\\n \\nAugust, we announced an overall deal with \\n\\u200b\\nShonda Rhimes\\n\\u200b\\n, the creator of global smash hits like \\n\\u200b\\nGrey’s\\n \\nAnatomy\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nHow to Get Away with Murder\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nScandal\\n\\u200b\\n, and others. We also acquired \\n\\u200b\\nMillarworld\\n\\u200b\\n, our one\\n \\nM&A transaction in our 20 year history, the home of legendary comic book writer Mark Millar. Our goal\\n \\nis to work with the best creators in the world and own the underlying intellectual property so that we\\n \\ncan continue to deliver amazing content to our members across the globe.\\n \\n \\nIn working with the best talent, we strive hard for awards recognition. At this year’s Primetime Emmys,\\n \\nwe scored 20 wins out of 92 nominations, second only to HBO, spread across eight different titles.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nSince 2013, we’ve taken the \\n\\u200b\\nLong Term View\\n\\u200b\\n that we’re in the early stages of the worldwide,\\n \\nmulti-decade transition from linear TV to internet entertainment. Recently, it’s been unfolding right\\n \\nbefore our eyes: \\n\\u200b\\nDisney\\n\\u200b\\n announced plans to launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and its other\\n \\nbrands, cable network owners are licensing their channels to virtual MVPDs like Hulu, YouTube, Sling TV,\\n \\nand DirecTV Now, CBS’ All Access is expanding \\n\\u200b\\ninternationally\\n\\u200b\\n, Apple is reportedly planning on spending\\n \\n$1 billion on original content and Amazon is streaming NFL games while its Prime Video service has gone\\n \\nglobal. Facebook launched its \\n\\u200b\\nWatch tab\\n\\u200b\\n for original videos.\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nAt the same time, linear TV networks like \\n\\u200b\\nMTV\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nA&E\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nWGN\\n\\u200b\\n are cutting down on scripted series. Last\\n \\nyear, the number of original scripted series on linear TV (across broadcast, premium and basic cable)\\n \\nbegan to decrease as online services ramped up activity.\\n \\nIt’s an exciting period and both media and technology companies see the same big opportunity as we\\n \\ndo. We have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible to please our\\n \\nmembers by earning their viewing time and to stay ahead of the competition in the decades to come.\\n \\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nIronically, as linear networks move outside of the traditional bundle and into direct-to-consumer\\n \\napplications, we are working more closely than ever with MVPDs/ISPs and other distributors. Building on\\n \\nour Q2 partnership with SFR/Altice in France, where Netflix is sold in a package with high speed Internet\\n \\nand TV services, and an earlier, comparable partnership with Proximus of Belgium, this past quarter we\\n \\nannounced the bundling of Netflix into \\n\\u200b\\nT-Mobile’s ONE family plan\\n\\u200b\\n. Our partners are enthusiastic about\\n \\nthe response to these bundles as the excitement around our big content enhances their offerings.\\n \\n \\nOur goal with all of our partnerships is to make it easy for members to sign up, pay and enjoy Netflix. We\\n \\nare pleased with the early results and we will continue pursuing these bundling opportunities as a\\n \\ncomplement to our core direct-to-consumer approach.\\n \\n \\nFree Cashflow and Capital Structure\\n \\nFree cash flow in Q3 totaled -$465 million vs. -$506 million last year and -$608 million in Q2’17. There is\\n \\nno change to our expectation for FCF of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017.  Negative FCF,\\n \\ndespite growing operating income, is due to growth of our content spend, original content in particular,\\n \\nwhere we pay for the titles before consumers enjoy the content, and the asset is amortized by\\n \\nestimated viewing over time. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market as our\\n \\nafter-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity.\\n \\n \\nSummary\\n \\n \\nThis quarter, among other new offerings, we are releasing the second Netflix original series from David\\n \\nFincher (\\n\\u200b\\nMindhunter), \\n\\u200b\\nnew seasons of our globally acclaimed franchises \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things \\n\\u200b\\nand \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown,\\n \\nour first Italian and German original shows (\\n\\u200b\\nSuburra\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n\\u200b\\n Dark)\\n\\u200b\\n and our most ambitious film yet, \\n\\u200b\\nBright\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nstarring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer.\\n \\n \\nWe feel privileged to be working with great artists all over the world and to be able to bring their\\n \\ncreations to a big, and growing, global audience. We’re delighted that consumers are embracing internet\\n \\nentertainment and are finding value and pleasure in the incredible stories offered by Netflix.\\n \\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are:  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2017\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nOctober 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary, 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2015\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nEarnings Interview, 3pm PST October 16th, 2017\\n\\xa0\\nOur video interview with Doug Mitchelson of UBS will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm PST today.\\n \\nQuestions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to \\n\\u200b\\ndoug.mitchelson@ubs.com\\n\\u200b\\n.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity\\n \\nmetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to\\n \\nrepay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in\\n \\noperations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nshould be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,\\n \\ndiluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures\\n \\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nare contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding growing revenues and our position within internet\\n \\nentertainment; price changes, increasing revenues, content spend and growing margin; marketing\\n \\nspend; investment in Asia and Rest of World markets; our original programming strategy; access to\\n \\ncontent, competition, and partnerships, including bundles; free cash flow and financing; domestic and\\n \\ninternational net, total and paid members; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin\\n \\nfor both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin;\\n \\nnet income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are\\n \\nsubject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without\\n \\nlimitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete\\n \\neffectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms and partnerships for streaming our service;\\n \\nfluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet\\n \\nService Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing\\n \\nin-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that\\n \\ncould cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is\\n \\n5\\n \\nincluded in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on\\n \\nForm 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017.

Our challenge andopportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product,content, and marketing as we’ve done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience.We’re in a position of strength given our $30 billion-plus in revenue, $6 billion in operating profit lastyear, growing free cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Our summary results and forecast are below.\\nQ2 R esults\\nRevenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year (or 13% excluding a -$339 million foreign currency impact), drivenby a 6% and 2% increase in average paid memberships and ARM, respectively. Excluding the impact of1\\nforeign exchange (F/X), ARM rose 7% year over year. The appreciation of the US dollar (USD) vs. mostother currencies since our April earnings report was the primary reason for the variance to our revenueguidance forecast. We slightly under-forecasted global paid net adds in Q2 (-1.0m vs. -2.0m forecast andcompared to +1.5m in the year ago quarter).\\n●In APAC, revenue grew 23% year over year, excluding F/X. At over $900 million of revenue, APACis approaching the size of our LATAM business. We added 1.1m paid memberships in the region(vs. 1.0m last Q2). ARM in APAC was -2% year over year on a F/X neutral basis, due to the impactfrom our price decrease in India last December as well as plan mix, which was partially offset by\\n1ARM\\n(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nhigher ARM in Korea and Australia. Excluding India, APAC ARM grew 4% year over year on aconstant currency basis.\\n●Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM increased 13% and 6% year over year, respectively, whilepaid net additions totaled -0.8m vs. 0.2m in the year ago quarter.\\n●Revenue in LATAM grew 19% year over year excluding F/X and surpassed the $1 billion quarterlymark for the first time, helped by constant currency ARM growth of 15%. Paid membershipswere flat sequentially (compared to 0.8m paid net adds in Q2’21).\\n●In UCAN, ARM and revenue each increased 10% year over year, excluding the impact of F/X. Paidnet adds were -1.3m vs. -0.4m in the year ago period. Retention improved over the course of thequarter and, while churn remains slightly elevated, it is now back near pre-price change levels.\\nWe’ve adjusted our cost structure for our current rate of revenue growth. This resulted in approximately$70 million of severance costs and an $80m non-cash impairment of certain real estate leases primarilyrelated to rightsizing our office footprint. Excluding these items totaling $150 million, and the F/X impactof the stronger US dollar since our April report, operating profit and operating margin were slightlyahead of our guidance forecast.\\nEPS of $3.20 vs. $2.97 a year ago exceeded our guidance forecast of $3.00 due to a $305 millionnon-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognizedbelow operating income in “interest and other income.” Our approximately $5 billion of Euro bondsprovides us with some natural hedge against the Euro for net income, but doesn’t affect operatingincome. Year to date, our gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro debt is $467 million.\\nQ3 F orecast\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. Asalways, we strive for accuracy although the current uncertain macro-economic environment leads toless-than-normal visibility.\\nThe US dollar continues to strengthen meaningfully against most currencies at ahistoric pace, withtheEuro recently falling below the US dollarfor thefirst time in two decades, a significant headwind for allmultinational US companies. We have high exposure to this unprecedented appreciation in the USDbecause nearly 60% of our revenue comes from outside the US and swings in F/X have a large flowthrough to operating profit as most of our expenses are in USD and don’t benefit from a stronger USD.\\nOur Q3 revenue growth forecast of 5% translates into 12% year over year revenue growth on a constantcurrency basis. Similarly, excluding the impact of currency, operating profit growth would be -3% yearover year (vs our forecast decline of -29%) and operating margin would be 20% (vs our forecast of 16%).As we have written in the past, over the medium term, we intend to continue to adjust our business asappropriate given the relative strength of the USD to protect our operating margin and try to avoidimmediate actions that we believe could be detrimental to the business.\\nWe forecast paid net adds for Q3 of +1.0m vs. 4.4m in the year ago quarter. We continue to expect fullyear 2022 operating margin of 19%-20%, excluding the unanticipated $150m of restructuring costs in Q2\\n2\\nnoted above and the material movement in F/X from January 2022, as our guidance was set based onF/X at that time (see ourQ4’21 letter).\\nContent, Mark eting, and Pr oduct\\nLast quarter, we discussed our slowing revenue growth, which we believe is the result of connected TVadoption, account sharing, competition, and macro factors such as sluggish economic growth and theimpacts of the war in Ukraine.\\nWe’ve now had more time to understand these issues, as well as how best to address them. First andforemost, we need to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix. This focus on improving our core servicehas served us well over the past 25 years, and remains our north star to drive continuous growth. It’swhy we strive for an ever better content, marketing and product experience. Also as a pure playstreaming business, we’re unencumbered by legacy revenue streams. This freedom means we can offerbig movies direct-to-Netflix, without the need for extended or exclusive theatrical windows, and letmembers binge watch TV if they want, without having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. Thisfocus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believeto be a significant long term business advantage.\\nOur content offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of member tastes by providing an unmatchedvariety and quality of titles. Our Q2 slate is emblematic of this approach, headlined by season four ofStranger Things, which returned to tremendous fanreception and was a smash hit by all measures -including an outstanding drama Emmy nomination (along withOzarkseason 4 andSquid Game). In itsfirst four weeks,Stranger Thingsseason four generated1.3 billion hours viewed, making it our biggest2\\nseason of English TV ever. Season four also re-ignited interest in past episodes with season one throughthree experiencing a greater than five-fold increase in viewing in the month after the release of seasonfour (vs. the prior month).\\nSeason four ofStranger Thingsalso showcased theeffectiveness of our marketing strategy in drivingconversation around our titles. When we deliver shows and movies that members are talking about inlarge numbers, we can influence pop culture, build passion for Netflix and create an experience that isdifferentiated and difficult-to-replicate. For example, the show catapulted the 1985 songRunning UpThat Hillto thetop of the music charts. Metallicaalso enjoyed a return to the charts in the US and UKwith their 1986 songMaster of Puppetsafter beingfeatured in the new season ofStranger Things. Thecumulative Twitter volume forStranger Thingscontinuesto outpace bothObi-Wan KenobiandTop GunMaverick, highlighting the big conversation aroundthis title and reinforcing that our binge versus oneweek at a time release strategy drives lots of “water cooler conversation.”\\n2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release for each title; since some titles have multiple premieredates, whether weekly or in parts, we count the 28 days from each episode premiere date in each country. Fortitles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 17, 2022. Wepublish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10.\\n3\\nSour ce: T witter.\\nWe also delivered a wide variety of other English language series hits in Q2, including season three ofThe Umbrella Academy(284m view hours*) and seasonone ofThe Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama, whichgenerated 277m hours viewed and has been renewed for a second season. We’ve also renewed theendearing, UK-produced young adult dramaHeartstopper(67m view hours) for another two seasons. Inunscripted, audiences embraced season five ofSellingSunset, which recorded 95m view hours in its firstfour weeks, while the debut season of marriage reality showThe Ultimatumhad 148m view hours.\\nIn unscripted, we are also taking global formats and creating local versions. This quarter, we hadRhythm+ Flow France, our rap competition show, which wasa big local success. The winner of season one, Fresh,was formerly unknown, working in a gym. But since his appearance on the show, he has become a starwith his song CHOP that he performed in the finale hitting #1 on every streaming service in France. Hewas also invited to the Les Ardentes music festival where he performed for an audience of 15,000 people- another example of \"The Netflix Effect.\"\\nWe’re making good progress in film. The basketball dramaHustle(starring Adam Sandler) was ourbiggest Netflix movie in Q2 (186m hours viewed) and was loved by critics and audiences alike, followedby the comedySenior Year, starring Rebel Wilson,with 161m view hours.\\nWe continue to invest in animated features; building off our initial titles likeOver the MoonandBacktothe Outback, we releasedThe Sea Beast(102m hoursviewed*) early in Q3 to audience and criticalacclaim. Today, we announced that we will be acquiring leading animation studioAnimal Logic, with~800 amazing people mostly in Sydney and Vancouver, which will help us accelerate the development ofour animation production capabilities and reinforces our commitment to build a world-class animationstudio. We’ve been partnering with Animal Logic for two years now, working onThe Magician’s Elephant(directed by Wendy Rogers) and the recently announcedThe Shrinking of the Treehorns(directed by RonHoward). Together, we’ll create an animation studio that will produce some of our largest animated\\n4\\nfeature films. We’ll fund the purchase from our existing cash balance. The deal is subject to certainregulatory approvals and we anticipate closing later this year.\\nWe’re building on our lead in non-English programming. We want Netflix to be relevant to audiences allover the globe and our local language titles are a differentiator for us. We focus first on telling authenticstories for local impact, but we see that great stories can travel everywhere. Another example of this InQ2 wasThe Marked Heart, a Colombian series, whichfound a global audience and ended up in the top10 in 81 countries around the world by its second week.  Similarly,The Takedown, a French film, wasinthe top 10 in 91 countries around the world by its second week, again showing the power of anauthentic story and our ability to serve those stories - with subtitling, dubbing, and personalizeddiscovery - for members to enjoy around the world.\\nWhile we always have room to improve, we’re very pleased with how far we’ve come in providing somuch satisfaction and enjoyment to our members. For instance, in the US, which is one of the mostcompetitive markets in the world, we drewmore TVviewing time than any other outletduring the2021-22 TV season (see chart below), nearly matching the combined total of the two most watchedbroadcast networks. And, as Nielsen will announce on Thursday, our share of US TV viewing reached anall-time high of 7.7% in June (vs. 6.6% in June 2021), demonstrating our ability to grow our engagementshare as we continue to improve our service.\\nSource:Nielsen.\\nSince our launch of a small selection of licensed mobile games last November, we’ve released newgames every few weeks, with the portfolio growing to the current total of 24. The games are all intendedto be accessible to broad audiences, and span several genres and categories, including racing withAsphalt Xtreme, the digital version of the irreverentcard gameExploding Kittens, zombies inInto theDead 2and the knitting for cats inKnittens. We’vehad millions of our members play games through theservice and we are learning about what games work for different audiences. We’re adapting our\\n5\\nlicensing and partner-based development activities in response to these learnings. We’ve also acquiredthree games studios (Night School Studios, Boss Fight Studios, and Next Games) which gives us a rangeof expertise in multiple geographies to accelerate the buildout of our internal development capacity. Weare building a solid pipeline of new games that will launch over the next several years and are excited tosee our members engage with these titles.\\nNear T erm F ocus\\nIn the near term, a key priority to re-accelerate revenue growth is to evolve and improve ourmonetization. In the early days of streaming, we kept our pricing very simple with just one plan level. In2014, we introduced three price tiers to better segment demand. Going forward, we will focus on bettermonetizing usage through both continued optimization of our pricing and tiering structures as well asthe addition of a new, lower-priced ad-supported tier.\\nAdvertisingOur lower priced advertising-supported offering will complementour existing plans, which will remainad-free. Our global ARM has grown at a 5% compoundannual rate from 2013 to 2021, so it makes sensenow to give consumers a choice for a lower priced option with advertisements, if they desire it.\\nWe recentlyannouncedMicrosoft as our technologyand sales partner and we’re targeting to launch thistier around the early part of 2023. They are investing heavily to expand their multi-billion advertisingbusiness into premium television video, and we are thrilled to be working with such a strong globalpartner. We’re excited by the opportunity given the combination of our very engaged audience and highquality content, which we think will attract premium CPMs from brand advertisers.\\nWe’ll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant. Like most of our newinitiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So,our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one.Over time, our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that’s more seamless andrelevant for consumers, and more effective for our advertising partners. While it will take some time togrow our member base for the ad tier and the associated ad revenues, over the long run, we thinkadvertising can enable substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth(through ad revenues).\\nPaid SharingWe’re in the early stages of working to monetize the 100m+ households that are currently enjoying, butnot directly paying for, Netflix. We know this will be a change for our members. As such, we havelaunchedtwo different approachesin Latin Americato learn more. Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paidsharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.We’re encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in LatinAmerica.\\n6\\nSimplicityAt Netflix, focus remains very important to us. These initiatives - paid sharing and advertising - dointroduce some additional complexity, but our approach has always been tokeep our business model assimple as possible within the context of our growth objectives. In this vein, these initiatives are similarto expanding into originals, launching our service across the world, and building our own studio, each ofwhich also increased complexity but are natural extensions intended to enhance our existing business.\\nF/X Neutr al Oper ating Mar gin Disclosur e\\nTo provide additional transparency around our operating margin, we’ll now disclose our year-to-date(YTD) operating margin based on F/X ratesat the beginningof each year.  This will allow investors to seehow our operating margin is tracking against our target (which was set in January of 2022 based on F/Xrates at that time), absent intra-year fluctuations in F/X (which have beensubstantial in 2022).\\nAs can be seen from the table below, F/X-driven changes to our revenue have a high flow through tooperating income (the operating profit impact ranges from ~75% to 80%+ of the revenue impact). This isbecause the bulk of our expenses don’t change with F/X fluctuations.\\n* Based on F /X rates at the beginning of each y ear. YTD 2022 thr ough June 30, 2022. Not e: Ther e were no adjus tmen ts tocontent amortiz ation f or the purposes of this c alcula tion, as titles ar e amortiz ed a t the his torical blended r ate at the time ofcapitalization.\\n7\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was +$103 million vs. -$64 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)in the quarter totaled+$13 million, compared with  -$175 million in Q2’21.3\\nCash declined $190m sequentially, primarily due to our Next Games acquisition ($69m) and the F/Ximpact on cash ($145m). As we’ve discussed previously, we are now self-funding. For the full year 2022,we expect FCF to be approximately +$1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars (assuming nomaterial further movements in F/X).\\nWe expect annual positive FCF going forward (with substantial growth in FCF in 2023 vs. 2022) due to ourincreasing revenue, solid profitability, and the successful multi-year evolution of our content model.We’re now more than a decade into transforming our service from licensed second run content tomostly Netflix originals - including more than five years into building out our internal studio to producethe majority of our original titles (60% of our net content assets on our balance sheet areNetflix-produced). We’re now through the most cash-intensive part of that transition. As a result, ourcash content spend-to-content amortization expense ratio peaked at 1.6x (along with peak negative FCFof -$3.3B in 2019) and is expected to be about 1.2-1.3x in 2022 and to decline going forward, based onour current plans, which assume no material expansion into new content categories in ‘23.\\n2022 es tima te based on the midpoin t of 1.2x -1.3x r ange.\\n3\\nFor a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes \\nthereto.\\n8\\nGross debt at quarter end amounted to $14.3 billion, within our targeted range of $10-$15 billion. Withcash of $5.8 billion, net debt totaled $8.5 billion, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA. Our capital structure policy4\\nremains unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund newgrowth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimumcash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (eg, about $5.3 billion based on Q2 revenue). Aftermeeting those needs, our intent is to return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nAt this year’s annual meeting in June, shareholders approved proposals to declassify our board, removesupermajority voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings. We’vealso changed the voting standard for our directors to simple majority in uncontested elections. Ourgovernance structure is now similar to other large cap company governance structures.\\nWith more than one billion people living with some form of disability, we want to ensure Netflix is asaccessible as possible. In Q2, we announced that we are expanding the availability of audio descriptionsand subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing to a total of 20 languages - work that recently won theprestigiousDr. Jacob Bolotin Award. We’ve also introducednew badges for our titles that have audiodescriptions and subtitles on laptop and iOS, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first.\\nSummar y\\nReaccelerating our revenue growth is a big challenge. But we’ve been through hard times before. We’vebuilt this company to be flexible and adaptable and this will be a great test for us and our highperformance culture. We’re fortunate to be in a position of strength as the leader in streamingentertainment by all metrics (revenue, engagement, subscribers, profit and free cash flow). We’reconfident and optimistic about the future.\\nReference\\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are:April 2022,January 2022,October 2021,July 2021,April 2021,January 2021,October 2020,July 2020.\\n4\\nDefined as net debt divided by last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA (Net income before interest \\nexpense and other income/expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and \\nequipment and further adjusted to exclude other non-cash charges).\\n9\\nRegional Br eakdown\\nJuly 19, 2022 Earnings Interview, 3pm PT\\nOur video interview with Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan will be onyoutube/netflixirat 3pm PT today.Questions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to douglas.anmuth@jpmorgan.com.Reed Hastings, co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, co-CEO & Chief Content Officer, Greg Peters, COO & Chief ProductOfficer, Spence Neumann, CFO,  and Spencer Wang, VP of IR/Corporate Development will all be on thevideo to answer Doug’s questions.\\n10\\nIR Contact:Spencer WangVP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development408 809-5360PR Contact:Emily FeingoldVP, Corporate Communications323 287-0756\\nUse of Non-GAAP MeasuresThis shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of F/Xneutral operating margin, free cash flow, last twelve months (“LTM”) EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA.Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquiditymetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available torepay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities likestock repurchases.

       "  'content': \"January 22, 2018\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\n \\nWe had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew\\n \\nstreaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million\\n \\nin 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than\\n \\ndoubled global operating income.\\n \\n.\\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nQ4 Results\\n \\nAverage paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in\\n \\nASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5%\\n \\nmargin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating\\n \\nmargin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year.\\n \\n \\nEPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items\\n \\nthat affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X\\n \\nremeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which\\n \\npartially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed\\n \\nrepatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform.\\n \\n \\nIn Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last\\n \\nyear’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than\\n \\nexpected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet\\n \\nentertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based.\\n \\nIn the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3\\n \\nmillion. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although\\n \\ncontribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the\\n \\nmarketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter.\\n \\n \\nInternationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record\\n \\nfor quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue\\n \\nand ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments\\n \\nin a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017\\n \\n(4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution\\n \\nprofit in our history.\\n \\n \\nWe took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward\\n \\nwith. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected\\n \\nexpense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger\\n \\nthan expected member growth and the timing of international content spend.\\n \\nForecast\\n \\nThe guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net\\n \\nadds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally.\\n \\nAs we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year\\n \\n2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year.\\n \\n \\nWe believe our big investments in content are paying off.  In 2017, average streaming hours per\\n \\nmembership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more\\n \\nrevenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nBig hits like \\n\\u200b\\n13 Reasons Why\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nBright \\n\\u200b\\nresult from a combination of great content and\\n \\ngreat marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about\\n \\n$1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content,\\n \\nand we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll\\n \\ngrow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018.\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nQ4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nBlack\\n \\nMirror\\n\\u200b\\n as well as \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n\\u200b\\n In the quarter, we\\n \\nalso successfully launched new titles like the limited series \\n\\u200b\\nGodless\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nMarvel’s The Punisher\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n \\nMindhunter\\n\\u200b\\n (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s\\n \\namazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had \\n\\u200b\\nthree of the Top\\n \\n5\\n\\u200b\\n most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row.\\n \\n \\nOur largest investment in original films to date, \\n\\u200b\\nBright, \\n\\u200b\\na fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a\\n \\nmajor success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, \\n\\u200b\\nBright\\n\\u200b\\n has become one of our\\n \\nmost viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well\\n \\nas additional investment in original films.\\n \\n \\nWe’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nClub de\\n \\nCuervos \\n\\u200b\\nas well as \\n\\u200b\\nThe Day I Met El Chapo,\\n\\u200b\\n both of which are from Mexico; \\n\\u200b\\nSuburra\\n\\u200b\\n from Italy; and an\\n \\nunscripted series from the UK, \\n\\u200b\\nJack Whitehall: Travels with My Father\\n\\u200b\\n. We also debuted \\n\\u200b\\nDark\\n\\u200b\\n, our first\\n \\nGerman original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for\\n \\ninstance, \\n\\u200b\\nDark\\n\\u200b\\n, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions\\n \\nof members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with\\n \\nattractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this\\n \\ninitiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland,\\n \\nIndia, Korea and Japan.\\n \\n \\nWe are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall\\n \\ndeals with \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n producer Shawn Levy and \\n\\u200b\\nOrange is the New Black\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nGLOW\\n\\u200b\\n creator Jenji\\n \\nKohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over\\n \\nthe world.\\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our\\n \\nmutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix,\\n \\nwhile our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of\\n \\nthese types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche\\n \\nTelekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC\\n \\nremoved the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net\\n \\n3\\n \\nneutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the\\n \\nFCC’s action.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nWe have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend\\n \\nbecomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On\\n \\nthe commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large\\n \\ncontent budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with\\n \\nApple Music or with iOS.\\n \\n \\nFacebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their\\n \\nmulti-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for\\n \\nentertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix.\\n \\n \\nTraditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring\\n \\nmost of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand\\n \\nand great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful\\n \\nservices. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content\\n \\nofferings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.\\n \\n \\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nIn Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower\\n \\nend of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of\\n \\ncontent payments, which will now occur in 2018.\\n \\n \\nOur operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is\\n \\ncontent. When we develop a title like \\n\\u200b\\nBright\\n\\u200b\\n, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated\\n \\nmembership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for\\n \\nself-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect\\n \\nthat in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend\\n \\nwill turn our business FCF positive.\\n \\n \\nIn the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re\\n \\ngrowing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had\\n \\nplanned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018.  Given our track record of content\\n \\ninvestments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the\\n \\nincreased investments we are making in original content this year.\\n \\n \\nWe anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of\\n \\ninterest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to\\n \\ngrow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt.  High yield has rarely seen\\n \\nan equity cushion so thick.\\n \\n4\\n \\nBoard of Directors\\n \\nWe are pleased to add \\n\\u200b\\nRodolphe Belmer\\n\\u200b\\n to our board of directors. Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+\\n \\nGroup in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing\\n \\npercentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our\\n \\nboard.\\n \\n \\nSummary\\n \\nOur goal is to entertain people. We are thrilled to be able to do that at great scale.\\n \\n \\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2017\\n\\u200b\\n,  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2017\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJanuary 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary, 2016\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nJanuary 22, 2018 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST\\n \\nOur video interview with Todd Juenger of Bernstein will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm PST today.\\n \\nQuestions that investors would like Todd to ask should be sent to \\n\\u200b\\ntodd.juenger@bernstein.com\\n\\u200b\\n. \\n\\u200b\\nReed\\n \\nHastings, CEO, David Wells, CFO, Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Greg Peters, Chief Product Officer\\n \\nand Spencer Wang, VP of IR/Corporate Development will be answering Todd’s questions.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIR Contact:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSpencer Wang\\n \\n  Vice President, Finance/IR & Corporate Development\\n \\n  408 809-5360\\n \\n \\n \\nPR Contact:\\n \\n \\nJonathan Friedland\\n \\nChief Communications Officer\\n \\n \\n310 734-2958\\n \\n \\n \\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free\\n \\ncash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity\\n \\nmetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to\\n \\nrepay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in\\n \\noperations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nshould be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,\\n \\ndiluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures\\n \\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nare contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding our investments in marketing, technology and\\n \\n5\\n \\ndevelopment, and content, including original content; content and product partnerships; impact of U.S.\\n \\nnet neutrality rules; growth of internet video and competitive landscape; future capital raises;\\n \\nexpectations of positive free cash flow, impact of the new limitation on the deductibility of interest;\\n \\ndomestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and\\n \\ncontribution margin for both domestic and international operations, as well as consolidated operating\\n \\nincome, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking\\n \\nstatements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events\\n \\nto differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;\\n \\nour ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;\\n \\nfluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet\\n \\nService Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing\\n \\nin-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that\\n \\ncould cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is\\n \\nincluded in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on\\n \\nForm 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company\\n \\nprovides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from\\n \\nthese forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on\\n \\nForm 10-K.

       "  'content': \"April 21, 2020\\n \\nFellow Shareholders,\\n \\nIn our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has\\n \\nreached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one\\n \\nknows how or when this terrible crisis will end. What’s clear is the escalating human cost in terms of lost\\n \\nlives and lost jobs, with tens of millions of people now out of work.\\n \\n \\nAt Netflix, we’re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to\\n \\npeople confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to\\n \\nmedium term. Like other home entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and\\n \\nincreased membership growth. In our case, this is offset by a sharply stronger US dollar, depressing our\\n \\ninternational revenue, resulting in revenue-as-forecast. \\n\\u200b\\nWe expect viewing to decline and membership\\n \\ngrowth to decelerate as home confinement ends, which we hope is soon.\\n \\n \\nBy helping people connect with stories they love, we are able to provide comfort and escape as well as a\\n \\nsense of community during this pandemic. So our focus has been on maintaining the quality of our\\n \\nservice while our employees around the world adapt to working from home.\\n \\n \\nFor the most part, this has gone smoothly. Our product teams, for example, have been relatively\\n \\nunaffected. As a precaution, we have temporarily reduced the number of product innovations we try,\\n \\nwhile continuing to release features that we know will add meaningful value for our members, such as\\n \\nimproved parental controls.\\n \\n \\nHowever, we have seen significant disruption when it comes to customer support and content\\n \\nproduction. On the customer support side, we’ve now fixed most of our work-from-home challenges. In\\n \\naddition, we’ve taken on another 2,000 agents (all working remotely), so our customer service levels are\\n \\nalmost fully restored despite the increased demand.\\n \\n \\nWhen it comes to production, almost all filming has now been stopped globally, with the exception of a\\n \\nfew countries like Korea and Iceland. This has been devastating for millions of workers in the TV and film\\n \\nindustry - electricians, hair and make-up artists, carpenters and drivers who are often paid hourly wages\\n \\nand work project-to-project.\\n \\n \\nIn March, we created a \\n\\u200b\\n$100 million fund\\n\\u200b\\n to help with hardship in the industry, starting with the hardest\\n \\nhit workers on our productions, where Netflix has the greatest responsibility. We will have paid these\\n \\ncrews for about seven weeks, with the goal of providing a bridge until government safety nets kick in. In\\n \\naddition, we’re donating $30 million to third parties and non-profits, providing emergency relief to\\n \\nout-of-work crew and cast across the broader TV and film industry in countries where we have a large\\n \\nproduction base.\\n \\n \\nThis includes donations of $1 million each to the \\n\\u200b\\nSAG-AFTRA Foundation COVID-19 Disaster Fund\\n\\u200b\\n, the\\n \\nMotion Picture and Television Fund\\n\\u200b\\n and the \\n\\u200b\\nActors Fund Emergency Assistance\\n\\u200b\\n in the US, and $1 million\\n \\nbetween the \\n\\u200b\\nAFC\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nFondation des Artistes\\n\\u200b\\n in Canada. These are all well established hardship funds. In\\n \\n1\\n \\nother countries where no such funds exist, we’ve been working to set them up, including in the UK (£1\\n \\nmillion) with the \\n\\u200b\\nBritish Film Institute\\n\\u200b\\n, in Italy (\\n€\\n1 million) with the \\n\\u200b\\nItalian Film Commission\\n\\u200b\\n, in France (\\n€\\n1\\n \\nmillion) with \\n\\u200b\\nAudiens\\n\\u200b\\n, in Brazil (R$5 million) with the \\n\\u200b\\nBrazilian Institute of Audiovisual Content\\n\\u200b\\n, in Mexico\\n \\n($1 million) with the \\n\\u200b\\nMexican Academy of Film Arts and Sciences\\n\\u200b\\n, in Spain (\\n\\u200b\\n€\\n\\u200b\\n1 million) with the \\n\\u200b\\nMinistry\\n \\nof Culture and Sport, Accion Cultural and the Film Academy\\n\\u200b\\n and in the Netherlands (\\n\\u200b\\n€\\n\\u200b\\n1 million) with the\\n \\nNetherlands Film Fund\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nIn total, we have committed to spend $150 million supporting the industry through this crisis.\\n \\n \\nNetflix’s culture is designed to empower decision making at all levels of the company. Throughout this\\n \\ncrisis, our employees have been working tirelessly to maintain the quality of our service and to find\\n \\nquick, practical solutions to the problems Netflix and our partners face.\\n \\n \\nFor example, within two weeks of the shelter-in-place orders coming into effect in Los Angeles, most of\\n \\nour animation production team was back up and running, working from home. On the post production\\n \\nside, we’ve been able to get 200+ projects going remotely. Most of our series writers’ rooms are\\n \\noperating virtually. However, we’ve been unable to create dubs in Italian and some other languages due\\n \\nto home confinement of our voice talent for a handful of titles launching in April and May. But we hope\\n \\nthat with the help of guilds around the world, voice actors can be set up from home, ensuring that they\\n \\ncan stay safe and continue to earn a living. Similar efforts are underway for both music and visual\\n \\neffects.\\n \\n \\nThis pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a strong Internet like never before. Over the years,\\n \\nwe’ve invested heavily in Open Connect, a pioneering caching system that puts our library of content as\\n \\nclose to members’ homes as possible. This enables ISPs to run their networks more efficiently and at a\\n \\nlower cost. However, given the surge in internet use, networks in some countries have struggled to\\n \\ncope.\\n \\n \\nIn March, we were asked by a number of governments and ISPs to temporarily reduce the network\\n \\ntraffic of our members. Using our Open Connect technology, our engineering team was able to respond\\n \\nimmediately, \\n\\u200b\\nreducing network use by 25 percent\\n\\u200b\\n virtually overnight in those countries, while also\\n \\nsubstantially maintaining the quality of our service, including in higher definition. We’re now working\\n \\nwith ISPs to help increase capacity so that we can lift these limitations as conditions improve.\\n \\n \\nNetflix employees have been outstanding and to help them support their local communities, we’ve\\n \\ndoubled our charitable match giving program for 2020. So for every $1 donated by our employees to an\\n \\norganization, we now donate an additional $2 to that organization.\\n \\n \\nLast, and most important of all, we want to say thank you on behalf of all our employees to the heroic\\n \\ndoctors, nurses and first responders fighting this pandemic on the frontlines and the grocery, restaurant\\n \\nand other essential workers who take risks to make sure our families are fed and taken care of. We are\\n \\ntruly inspired and humbled by you.\\n \\nOur summary results for Q1 and our Q2 forecast can be found in the table below.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nQ1 Results and Q2 Forecast\\n \\nDespite paid net additions that were higher than forecast, revenue was in-line with our guidance due to\\n \\nthe appreciation in the US dollar vs. other currencies. Excluding a -$115m impact from F/X, streaming\\n \\nARPU grew 8% year over year. Operating margin of 16.6% (vs. 10.2% in the prior year quarter) was lower\\n \\nthan our 18.0% forecast as we incurred $218m in incremental content costs due to paused productions\\n \\nand hardship fund commitments (a 3.8 percentage point impact to operating margin).\\n \\n \\nThere are three primary effects on our financial performance from the crisis. First, our membership\\n \\ngrowth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement. Second, our international revenue will\\n \\nbe less than previously forecast due to the dollar rising sharply. Third, due to the production shutdown,\\n \\nsome cash spending on content will be delayed, improving our free cash flow, and some title releases\\n \\nwill be delayed, typically by a quarter. More on each of these three effects below.\\n \\n \\nDuring the first two months of Q1, our membership growth was similar to the prior two years, including\\n \\nin UCAN. Then, with lockdown orders in many countries starting in March, many more households\\n \\njoined Netflix to enjoy entertainment. This timing of paid membership additions also affected our Q1’20\\n \\nglobal streaming ARPU; this was the primary driver of the sequential decline in streaming ARPU as the\\n \\nrevenue impact from these additions late in the quarter will be mostly felt in Q2’20 and beyond.\\n \\nHopefully, progress against the virus will allow governments to lift the home confinement soon. As that\\n \\nhappens, we expect viewing and growth to decline. Our internal forecast and guidance is for 7.5 million\\n \\nglobal paid net additions in Q2. Given the uncertainty on home confinement timing, this is mostly\\n \\nguesswork. The actual Q2 numbers could end up well below or well above that, depending on many\\n \\n3\\n \\nfactors including when people can go back to their social lives in various countries and how much people\\n \\ntake a break from television after the lockdown. Some of the lockdown growth will turn out to be\\n \\npull-forward from the multi-year organic growth trend, resulting in slower growth after the lockdown is\\n \\nlifted country-by-country. Intuitively, the person who didn’t join Netflix during the entire confinement is\\n \\nnot likely to join soon after the confinement. Plus, last year we had new seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n \\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n in Q3, which were not planned for this year’s Q3. Therefore, we currently guess that\\n \\nQ3’20 and Q4’20 will have lower net additions than last year due to these effects.\\n \\n \\nSecond, partially due to the crisis, the US dollar has appreciated significantly, which creates a drag on\\n \\ninternational revenue growth. As an example, the price for our standard plan in Brazil is R$33, which\\n \\nused to be $8.5 last year but now is $6.5 based on April 2020 F/X rates, so we have a ~25% decline in US\\n \\ndollar average subscription price from Brazil, which offsets strong membership growth.\\n \\n \\nThird, we’ve paused most of our productions across the world in response to government lockdowns\\n \\nand guidance from local public health officials. In Q2, there is only a modest impact on our new releases,\\n \\nwhich is primarily language dubbing. No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart\\n \\nphysical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible,\\n \\nand how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages, and post-production) will play out. The\\n \\nimpact on us is less cash spending this year as some content projects are pushed out. We are working\\n \\nhard to complete the content we know our members want and we’re complementing this effort with\\n \\nadditional licensed films and series.\\n \\n \\nOur content competitors and suppliers will be impacted about as much as we are, in terms of new titles.\\n \\nSince we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our\\n \\nmember satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers’ by a shortage of new content, but it will take\\n \\ntime to tell.\\n \\n \\nWe continue to target a 16% operating margin for the full year 2020, despite the extra costs in Q1. As a\\n \\nreminder, more than half of our revenue is not denominated in US dollars and we don’t hedge our\\n \\nforeign exchange exposure. If the US dollar remains at these elevated levels (or strengthens further), we\\n \\nmay target modestly slower growth in our annual operating margin progression next year. Given that\\n \\nlead time, we believe we can readjust our model to be appropriate in that new stronger US dollar world.\\n \\nContent\\n \\nAs people shelter at home, our hope is that we can help make that experience more bearable by\\n \\nproviding a diverse range of high quality content for our members. While our productions are largely\\n \\npaused around the world, we benefit from a large pipeline of content that was either complete and\\n \\nready for launch or in post-production when filming stopped.\\n \\nFor Q2, we’re looking forward to releasing all of our originally planned shows and films (with some\\n \\nlanguage dubbing impacts on a few titles). We’re also finding ways to bolster our programming this year\\n \\n- including the recent acquisition of Paramount’s and Media Rights Capital’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Lovebirds\\n\\u200b\\n, a comedy\\n \\nstarring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, for Q2’20 and Legendary Pictures’ \\n\\u200b\\nEnola Holmes\\n\\u200b\\n starring Millie\\n \\nBobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin, for Q3 ‘20. So, while we’re certainly\\n \\n4\\n \\nimpacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety\\n \\nof new titles throughout 2020 and 2021.\\n \\nOur Q1 slate highlighted the variety of content that people enjoy en masse all over the world on Netflix:\\n \\nscripted English language series like \\n\\u200b\\nOzark\\n\\u200b\\n season 3 (a projected 29m member households will have\\n \\nchosen to watch this season in its first four weeks), the riveting docu-series \\n\\u200b\\nTiger King: Murder, Mayhem\\n \\nand Madness \\n\\u200b\\n(64m), our breakthrough unscripted dating show \\n\\u200b\\nLove is Blind\\n\\u200b\\n (30m), original film \\n\\u200b\\nSpenser\\n \\nConfidential\\n\\u200b\\n (85m), and season four of the Spanish language hit \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel\\n\\u200b\\n, aka \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n (a\\n \\nprojected 65m), which debuted in early April.\\n \\nIn Q2, we are looking forward to the launch of\\n\\u200b\\n Space Force\\n\\u200b\\n, our new original comedy series created by\\n \\nGreg Daniels (\\n\\u200b\\nThe Office\\n\\u200b\\n) and Steve Carell, starring Carell, John Malkovich and Lisa Kudrow. We just\\n \\nlaunched our latest buzzy unscripted series \\n\\u200b\\nToo Hot to Handle,\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\n#BlackAF\\n\\u200b\\n from Kenya Barris and, outside\\n \\nthe US, the Michael Jordan documentary \\n\\u200b\\nThe Last Dance\\n\\u200b\\n, which we co-produced with ESPN (launching\\n \\non Netflix in the US on July 19)\\n\\u200b\\n. \\n\\u200b\\nWe will also premiere\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nHollywood\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nfrom Ryan Murphy, and, later this\\n \\nweek, \\n\\u200b\\nExtraction\\n\\u200b\\n, a large scale action film starring Chris Hemsworth and directed by Sam Hargrave, who\\n \\nwas the stunt coordinator and choreographer on films like \\n\\u200b\\nAvengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War,\\n \\nDeadpool 2, \\n\\u200b\\nand\\n\\u200b\\n Captain America: Civil War.\\n \\n \\nProduct\\n \\nIn February, we rolled out our \\n\\u200b\\nTop 10 most popular lists\\n\\u200b\\n to nearly 100 countries, after testing this\\n \\nfeature last year in the UK and Mexico. In each of these countries, there are now three daily lists: Top 10\\n \\noverall, Top 10 series and Top 10 films. Our goal with this feature is to help members find great TV\\n \\nshows and films and enable them to be part of the cultural zeitgeist in their country.\\n \\nRecently, we’ve also enhanced our parental controls for our service to improve the experience for family\\n \\nmembers of all ages. \\n\\u200b\\nUpdates\\n\\u200b\\n include (i) PIN-controlled access to content by maturity level; (ii) the\\n \\nability to PIN protect specific titles as well as profiles; (iii) Profile-level content filtering; (iv) the ability to\\n \\ncreate kids’ experiences that can be customized for different age groups (‘teens and below,’ ‘older kids\\n \\nand below’ and ‘little kids’); and (v) the ability to disable post-play for kids from account settings.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nIn Q1, net cash used in operating activities was +$260 million vs. -$380 million in the prior year period.\\n \\nFree cash flow\\n totaled +$162 million compared with -$460 million in the year ago quarter. As we stated\\n \\n1\\nlast quarter, our FCF profile is beginning to improve due to growing operating margin and profits and as\\n \\nwe digest our big move into the production of Netflix originals (which requires more cash upfront vs.\\n \\nlater-window content) that started five years ago.\\n \\n \\nWith our productions currently paused, this will shift out some cash spending on content to future\\n \\nyears. As a result, we’re now expecting 2020 FCF of -$1 billion or better (compared with our prior 2020\\n \\nexpectation of -$2.5 billion and -$3.3 billion actual in 2019). This dynamic may result in more lumpiness\\n \\n1\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the\\n \\nreconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n \\n5\\n \\nin our path to sustained FCF profitability (as, prior to the pandemic, we had been planning for annual\\n \\nimprovement in FCF). However, there has been no material change to our overall time table to reach\\n \\nconsistent annual positive FCF and we believe that 2019 will still represent the peak in our annual FCF\\n \\ndeficit.\\n \\nWe finished the quarter with cash of $5.2 billion, while our $750m unsecured credit facility remains\\n \\nundrawn. Combined with our improved FCF outlook for 2020, we have more than 12 months of liquidity\\n \\nand substantial financial flexibility.

Fullyear revenue of $30 billion grew 19% year over year while operating income of $6.2 billion rose 35% yearover year. We finished Q4 with 222m paid memberships (with 8.3m paid net adds in Q4). Even in a worldof uncertainty and increasing competition, we’re optimistic about our long-term growth prospects asstreaming supplants linear entertainment around the world. We\\'re continually improving Netflix so thatwe can please our members, grow our share of leisure time and lead in this transition. Our summaryresults and forecast are below.\\nQ4 R esults and Q1 F orecast\\nRevenue in Q4’21 grew 16% year over year with a 9% increase in average paid memberships. ARMrose1\\n7% year over year on both a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, two percentage pointsfaster than Q3’21 (ex-F/X). Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 8%, a six percentage point decrease vs.the year ago period. The decline in operating margin was expected given our large content slate in Q4this year. Operating margin was above our beginning of quarter forecast of 6.5% due to slightly lowerthan forecasted content spend. As a result, our full year operating margin was 21% vs. 18% in 2020,\\n1ARM\\n(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nabove our 20% guidance forecast. EPS in Q4 of $1.33 vs. $1.19 a year ago included a $104m non-cashunrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\nWe slightly over-forecasted paid net adds in Q4 (8.3m actual compared to the 8.5m paid net adds in boththe year ago quarter and our beginning of quarter projection). For the full year 2021, paid net addstotaled 18m vs 37m in 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with more than 90% of our paid netadds in 2021 coming from outside the UCAN region.\\nNonetheless, our UCAN region added 1.2m paid memberships in Q4’21 (vs. 0.9m last year), marking ourstrongest quarter of member growth in this region since the early days of COVID-19 in 2020. In APAC, weincreased paid memberships by 2.6m (vs. 2.0m in the year ago quarter) with strong growth in both Japanand India. EMEA was our largest contributor to paid net adds in Q4 (3.5m vs. 4.5m in the prior yearperiod) and the region delivered record quarterly revenue, exceeding $2.5 billion for the first time.LATAM paid net adds totaled 1.0m vs. 1.2m last year.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and in others it willbe low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there willnaturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net adds performance vs. forecast.\\nFor Q1’22, we forecast paid net adds of 2.5m vs. 4.0m in the year ago quarter. Our guidance reflects amore back-end weighted content slate in Q1’22 (for example,BridgertonS2 and our new original filmThe Adam Projectwill both be launching in March).In addition, while retention and engagement remainhealthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels. We think this may be due toseveral factors including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts ofthe world like LATAM.\\n2\\nFor 2022, we are currently targeting an operating margin of 19%-20% (assuming no material swings inforeign currency from current levels). Our operating margin outlook is driven by two main factors. First,as seen in the chart below, we delivered above the three percentage point annual linear progressionover the past two years (average of four percentage points per year).\\nSecond, theUS dollar has strengthened meaningfullyagainst most other currencies. With ~60% of ourrevenue outside of the US due to our international success, we estimate that the US dollar’s appreciationover the past six months has cost us roughly $1 billion in expected 2022 revenue (as a reminder, wedon’t hedge). With the vast majority of our expenses in US dollars, this translates into an estimated twopercentage point negative impact on our 2022 operating margin.\\nAs we have written in the past, over the medium term we believe we can adjust our pricing and coststructure for a stronger US dollar world. In the near term, we want to continue to invest appropriately inour business and don’t want to over-react to F/X fluctuations to the detriment of our long term growth.There is no change to our goal of steadily growing our operating margin at an average increase of threepercentage points per year over any few year period.\\n3\\nContent\\nOur Q4 content slate epitomizes what we strive for: a wide variety of quality TV series and films. We hada number of big hits in Q4. We released new seasons of returning shows likeThe Witcher(484 millionhours viewed),You(468m hours viewed),Emily inParis(287 million hours viewed) and on December 31,2\\nCobra Kai(274m hours viewed*), as well as the criticallyacclaimed limited seriesMaid(469m hoursviewed). The dystopian Korean thrillerSquid Game- a late Q3 release that broke through globally early inQ4 - generated 1.65 billion hours viewed in its first four weeks and is now our biggest TV season ever.The fourth quarter also featured the conclusion to one of our most popular shows -La Casa de PapelakaMoney Heist(6.7 billion hours viewed over its lifetime).We’re excited to expand theLCDPuniverse withour Korean adaptation,Money Heist: Korea - JointEconomic Area, launching later this year.\\nOver the years, we’ve learned that big hits can come from anywhere in the world (with great subtitlesand dubbing), as we’ve seen withLa Casa de Papel,Squid Game, andLupinto name just a few. But ourgoal with non-English originals is to first and foremost thrill audiences in their home country. And in thequarter, we saw big local viewing for titles such asLove is Blind Brazil,My Namefrom Korea, superherofilmMinnal Muralifrom India and Danish thrillerThe Chestnut Man.\\nFilm is incredibly important for our members, which is why our ambition has always been to work withthe world’s best filmmakers and stars to create a wide variety of quality movies. We took a large stepforward in Q4 on this front with our biggest film slate ever. Our blockbusterRed Notice(starring DwayneJohnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds) quickly became our most popular movie launch of all-time with364 million hours viewed in its first four weeks. Other hits this quarter includeThe Unforgivable,starring\\n2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with anasterisk), data is from launch date through January 18, 2022.

Yangand Nina Dobrev (134m hours viewed),animated featureBack to the Outback(105m hours viewed)andThe Harder They Fall(122m hoursviewed). On Christmas Eve, we released the star-studded satireDon’t Look Up(featuring LeonardoDiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep),which is already our second most popular film ever with 353m* hours viewed.\\nOverall in 2021, Netflix series accounted for six out of the 10 most searched shows globally while ourfilms represented two of the top 10.\\nGoogle Year in Search, 2021 (Global)\\nSour ce: Google.\\nIn November we debuted our mobile games experience globally on Android and iOS. Members can nowdiscover and launch games from within the Netflix mobile app. Since launch, we released an additionalfive games, bringing the total to ten for 2021. It’s still very early days but we’re pleased with ourprogress. In 2022, we’ll expand our portfolio of games across both casual and core gaming genres as wecontinue to program a breadth of game types to learn what our members enjoy most.\\nMark eting & Communic ations\\nOne of our goals with marketing is to help drive conversation about and passion for our titles. We knowthat Netflix fans want to dive deeper into what they watch with behind-the-scenes details, interviews,and updates. To make it easier and more engaging for our fans, we’ve launched the siteTudum(namedafter our “sonic logo”) as a home for extending stories and conversation and further building fandom forour TV shows and films.\\nProduct & Pricing\\nNetflix offers a wide variety of TV shows and films to its members, which we know they value. We alsowork hard to make it easy for members to access this content. For instance, in October, we introducedvoice-driven Play Something, first on Amazon Fire TV devices (TVs, sticks, and set top boxes). Now,members can simply say “Play Something on Netflix” or “Play a movie on Netflix” and playback will start\\n5\\nregardless of whether you are browsing Netflix or another service. If they don’t like what’s playing,simply saying “play something else” or “next” will play the next title in the list. Voice-driven PlaySomething makes choosing effectively effortless.\\nIn December, welowered our pricesin India acrossall four plans. India is fairly unique because pay TVpricing is very low. We believe these new prices will make Netflix more accessible to a broader swath ofthe population - strengthening our value perception. Our goal is to maximize long term revenue in eachof our markets.\\nCompe tition\\nConsumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time - competition thathas only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world developtheir own streaming offering. While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth some,we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives havelaunched. This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition fromlinear to streaming and that with under 10% of total TV screen time in the US, our biggest market, Netflixhas tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$403 million vs. -$138 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)for the quarter was-$569 million vs. -$284 million in Q4‘20. For the full year3\\n2021, FCF amounted to -$159 million, in-line with our expectation for “approximately break-even.”\\nWe didn’t engage in share repurchases in Q4 as we funded our acquisition of the Roald Dahl StoryCompany from cash on hand during the quarter.\\nWe anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, weprioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming,followed by selective acquisitions. We’re also targeting $10-$15 billion of gross debt. We finished Q4with gross debt of $15.5 billion and we’ll pay down $700 million of our senior notes due in Q1’22. Aftersatisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above our minimum cash levels will be returned toshareholders via stock repurchases.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nWhile our current governance structure has served our shareholders extraordinarily well with asustained period of substantial growth, we’ve clearly proven our business model: streaming is now anestablished business, we’re self-funding and expect sustained positive free cash flow, and we’vesubstantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margin. So the Netflix Board has decided toevolve to a more standard large-cap governance structure and will recommend several changes at our\\n3\\nFor a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes \\nthereto.\\n6\\nnext annual meeting. These include declassifying our board, removing supermajority voting provisions inour charter and bylaws, and enabling shareholders to call special meetings. We will also change thevoting standard for our directors in uncontested elections.\\nLong T erm St ock Price P erformance\\nIn each January investor letter, we provide an update on our long term stock performance. We continueto manage our business for the long term and under the belief that pleasing our members will lead tostrong value creation for our fellow shareholders.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures,during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, makestrategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However,this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superiorto, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in)operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Paid net adds totaled 6.8m compared to our 7.0m forecast and prior year Q3 of 6.1m. As\\n \\nwe’ve improved the variety, diversity and quality of our content slate, member engagement has grown,\\n \\nrevenue has increased, and we’re able to further fund our content investment.\\n \\n \\n \\nQ3 Results and Q4 Forecast\\n \\nIn Q3’19, average streaming paid memberships and ARPU grew 22% and 9% year over year, respectively.\\n \\nExcluding a -$137m year over year impact from F/X, consolidated revenue growth was 35%, while\\n \\nstreaming ARPU growth was 12%. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above our\\n \\nguidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4’19. EPS\\n \\namounted to $1.47 vs. $0.89 and included a $171 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X\\n \\nremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Our Euro bonds provide us with a small natural hedge\\n \\nfor our growing European revenues.\\n \\n \\nTotal paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. As a reminder,\\n \\nthe quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for\\n \\naccuracy. In Q3, our guidance forecast was our most accurate in recent history.\\n \\n1\\n \\n \\n \\nIn the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are\\n \\n2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention\\n \\nhas not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US\\n \\nmembership growth. On a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a\\n \\nmeaningful impact on paid net adds. However, revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU\\n \\nincreased 16.5% year over year in Q3. With more revenue, we’ll continue to invest to improve our\\n \\nservice to further strengthen our value proposition.\\n \\nInternational paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and\\n \\nslightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over\\n \\nthe course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international\\n \\nrevenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We’re making strides\\n \\nin our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing\\n \\nencouraging signs of progress.\\n \\n \\nFor Q4, we’re expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU\\n \\ngrowth. We’re forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for\\n \\nthe international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last\\n \\nyear. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast\\n \\nreflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content\\n \\nslate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor\\n \\nelevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. As we outline in\\n \\nmore detail below, our long term outlook on our business is unchanged.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n \\n \\nWe’re on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we’ll be targeting\\n \\nanother 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin\\n \\nimprovement we’ve delivered each year since 2017. As we’ve said previously, large swings in F/X could\\n \\nlead to some variations from our steady annual margin progression, partially because we don’t buy\\n \\nderivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars.\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nWe strive to program Netflix with the best variety of high quality content across many genres (scripted\\n \\nseries, films, docs, comedy specials, unscripted TV, kids & family, anime, etc.). Our ambitious approach\\n \\nreflects our goal to satisfy the entertainment desires of our 158m-plus members and to attract as many\\n \\nof the hundreds of millions of non-members as we can. To accomplish this, we need great breadth of\\n \\nquality content because people have very diverse tastes.\\n \\n \\nIf you think about your own habits, you’ll recognize that what you want to watch on a Friday night may\\n \\ndiffer from what you want to watch on Tuesday after a long day of work or what you want to watch with\\n \\nyour family on Saturday morning or what you want to watch with your friends on Sunday afternoon.\\n \\nNow, multiply that by the billions of people on the planet and all the other factors that affect viewing\\n \\npreferences and you will have a sense of the breadth of programming necessary to be as successful as\\n \\nwe desire.\\n \\n \\nWe have been moving increasingly to original content both because of the anticipated pullback of\\n \\nsecond run content from some studios and because our original content is working in the form of\\n \\nmember viewing and engagement. We started first with English scripted TV series more than six years\\n \\nago to great success. We continued in Q3 with \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n Season 3 (the most watched season to\\n \\ndate with 64m member households in its first four weeks). We also introduced new limited series like\\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nUnbelievable\\n\\u200b\\n, one of our most thought provoking and highly viewed dramas (watched by 32m member\\n \\nhouseholds in its first 28 days).\\n \\nWe’re expanding our non-English language original offerings because they continue to help grow our\\n \\npenetration in international markets. In Q3, Season 3 of\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel\\n\\u200b\\n (aka \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n) became the\\n \\nmost watched show on Netflix across our non-English language territories with 44m households\\n \\nwatching the new season in the first four weeks of release. \\n\\u200b\\nSintonia\\n\\u200b\\n, our latest Brazilian original, was the\\n \\nsecond most watched inaugural season in Brazil. \\n\\u200b\\nThe Naked Director\\n\\u200b\\n broke out as the biggest title launch\\n \\nfor us in Japan and was also highly successful throughout Asia. Similarly, in India, we debuted the second\\n \\nseason of \\n\\u200b\\nSacred Games\\n\\u200b\\n, our most watched show in India. To date, we have globally released 100\\n \\nseasons of local language, original scripted series from 17 countries and have plans for over 130 more in\\n \\n2020. We also plan to expand our investment in local language original films and unscripted series.\\n \\n \\nWe’re also investing aggressively in original films and making great progress with improving results. Our\\n \\noriginal film slate in Q3 featured several solid hits like \\n\\u200b\\nSecret Obsession\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Brenda Song) and\\n \\nOtherhood\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by Cindy Chupack in her feature directorial debut), which were  watched by 40\\n \\nmillion and 29 million households in their first four weeks, respectively. \\n\\u200b\\nTall Girl\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n\\u200b\\n a new family film\\n \\nstarring Ava Michelle, was also a success with 41m households watching in the first 28 days. We expect\\n \\nthat our Q4 film releases will continue to build and strengthen our film effort. Q4 film releases include\\n \\nMartin Scorsese’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Irishman\\n\\u200b\\n (with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci), \\n\\u200b\\nMarriage Story\\n\\u200b\\n (starring\\n \\nScarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Two Popes\\n\\u200b\\n (featuring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan\\n \\nPryce), all of which have emerged as early Oscar frontrunners. We also have several big releases such as\\n \\nDolemite is My Name\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Eddie Murphy and featuring a breakout performance from \\n\\u200b\\nDa'Vine Joy\\n \\nRandolph\\n\\u200b\\n), \\n\\u200b\\n6 Underground\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds), \\n\\u200b\\nThe Laundromat\\n\\u200b\\n, from\\n \\ndirector Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman and\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nThe King\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\n(starring \\n\\u200b\\nTimothée\\n \\nChalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton) as well as animated features\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nKlaus\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nI Lost My Body\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\nOur goal is to have the quality of our slate rival the ambition of its scope. An example is \\n\\u200b\\nOrange is the\\n \\nNew Black\\n\\u200b\\n, which wrapped its final new season in Q3. The show was celebrated by fans and the media\\n \\nfor the groundbreaking role it played for Netflix and the culture at large; Time Magazine said\\n \\n \\n“...’Orange is the New Black’ is the most important TV show of the decade.”\\n\\u200b\\n  Our very popular \\n\\u200b\\nOzark,\\n \\nOur Planet, Queer Eye, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nWhen They See Us\\n\\u200b\\n led 40 Netflix original series\\n \\nand films to a record 117 Emmy Nominations and 27 wins in 2019.\\n \\nWith so many firms now looking to provide premium video content to consumers, it’s a great time to be\\n \\na creator of content. Amazing content can be expensive. We don’t shy away from taking bold swings if\\n \\nwe think the business impact will also be amazing. We don’t close every deal we chase and we don’t\\n \\nchase every deal on the table. And while not all projects that we do pursue will work out, our large and\\n \\ngrowing subscription base helps enable us to try many approaches, while the size of our content budget\\n \\n(~$10 billion on P&L spend and ~$15 billion in cash content spend in 2019) insulates us from\\n \\ndependency on any single title. We’ll continue to learn as we go, while staying disciplined by assessing\\n \\neach opportunity individually, steadily marching up our operating margin and improving free cash flow.\\n \\n \\n \\n4\\n \\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe seek to make it easier for future members to sign up and enjoy Netflix. To that end, we rolled out a\\n \\nlower priced mobile plan in India in July and we’re pleased with the results. Our approach with pricing is\\n \\nto grow revenue and so far, uptake and retention on our mobile plan in India has been better than our\\n \\ninitial testing suggested. This will allow us to invest more in Indian content to further satisfy our\\n \\nmembers. While still only a very small percentage of our total subscriber base, we’re continuing to test\\n \\nmobile-only plans in other markets.\\n \\n \\nWe continued to expand our partner-based bundle offerings, adding bundles with Sky Italia, Canal+ in\\n \\nFrance, KDDI in Japan and Izzi in Mexico this quarter. We just localized our service in Vietnamese,\\n \\nHungarian and Czech so that more entertainment fans can enjoy thousands of hours of TV shows and\\n \\nfilms in their preferred language. We’ll continue to expand language coverage and accessibility.\\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nWe compete broadly for entertainment time. This means there are many competitive activities to Netflix\\n \\n(from watching linear TV to playing video games, for example). But there is also a very large market\\n \\nopportunity; today we believe we’re less than 10% of TV screen time in the US (our most mature\\n \\nmarket) and much less than that in mobile screen time. Many are focused on the “streaming wars,” but\\n \\nwe’ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade.\\n \\nThe upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased\\n \\ncompetition, but we are all small compared to linear TV. While the new competitors have some great\\n \\ntitles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming\\n \\nthat we are producing around the world.\\n \\n \\nThe launch of these new services will be noisy. There may be some modest headwind to our near-term\\n \\ngrowth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we’ll\\n \\ncontinue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. By way of\\n \\nexample, our growth in Canada, where Hulu does not exist, is nearly identical to our growth in the US\\n \\n(where Hulu is very successful at about 30 million paid memberships). Our penetration in both markets\\n \\nbelow:\\n \\n5\\n \\n \\n \\nWe believe this is due to the big factor of streaming growing into linear TV plus the fact that streaming\\n \\nvideo services have mostly exclusive content libraries that make them highly differentiated from one\\n \\nanother. In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the\\n \\nshift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast\\n \\nTV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for\\n \\nmany players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and\\n \\nDiscovery didn’t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience\\n \\nshare from broadcast viewing.\\n \\n \\nContent creation is booming around the world and everyone is vying for consumer attention. Over the\\n \\nnext 10 years, many streaming services will grow viewing as streaming replaces linear TV. Our focus will\\n \\ncontinue to be on pleasing our members and growing engagement because that approach has served us\\n \\nwell since 1997. Total viewing, as measured by various 3rd parties, is the best indicator of our relative\\n \\nsuccess since it’s a signal of customer satisfaction, and few of the services will disclose streaming video\\n \\nrevenue, and subscriber figures are hard to interpret (given bundles, discounts and other promotions).\\n \\nOur focused approach to date has driven meaningful growth in our membership base and engagement.\\n \\n \\nWe did well during the first decade of streaming. We’ve been preparing for this new wave of\\n \\ncompetition for a long time. It’s why we started investing in originals in 2012 and expanded aggressively\\n \\never since - across programming categories and countries with an ambition to share stories from the\\n \\nworld to the world. In Q4, with \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nKlaus\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Irishman\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Two Popes\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\n6\\n \\nUnderground\\n\\u200b\\n, and many other amazing titles launching, we’re ready to compete to earn consumers’\\n \\nattention and viewing.\\n \\n \\n \\n6\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash used in operating activities in Q3’19 was -$502 million vs. -$690 million in the prior year period.\\n \\nFree cash flow\\n in Q3 totaled -$551 million vs. -$859 million in Q3’18. For the full year 2019, we’re still\\n \\n1\\nexpecting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding\\n \\noperating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we’re\\n \\nexpecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually\\n \\nbeyond 2020. As we move slowly toward FCF positive, our plan is to continue to use the high yield\\n \\nmarket in the interim to finance our investment needs.\\n \\n \\nNext Year Reporting\\n \\nStarting with our Q4’19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership\\n \\nby region, which is how we think about our business. Our four regions are Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe,\\n \\nMiddle East & Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM), and the US and Canada (UCAN). UCAN is roughly\\n \\n90% US and 10% Canada. Under this new reporting format, we’ll only provide membership guidance for\\n \\nglobal\\n\\u200b\\n paid memberships for the next quarter with each earnings report.\\n \\n \\nAs we self-produce and license more original content that has global rights, we are finding US vs.\\n \\ninternational segment contribution margin reporting is becoming less useful internally. We’ll stop\\n \\nreporting on it in January 2020 and continue to focus on global operating margin as our primary\\n \\nprofitability metric. As a reminder, we’ll no longer report free trial members beginning in 2020 as we\\n \\ninformed you in our \\n\\u200b\\nQ3’18 investor letter\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n1\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the\\n \\nreconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n \\n7\\n \\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2019\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nOctober 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2017\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nOctober 16, 2019 Earnings Interview, 3pm PDT\\n \\nOur video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm\\n \\nPDT today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are\\n \\nimportant liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated\\n \\n8\\n \\n \\nthat is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the\\n \\namount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of\\n \\nthese non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial\\n \\nstatements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding pricing; investments in our service; future content\\n \\nofferings and approach to accessing content; investment in local language original films and unscripted\\n \\nseries; evolution of streaming video services; product tests and changes; impact of and reaction to\\n \\ncompetition; future capital raises; U.S. and international streaming paid memberships, paid net\\n \\nadditions, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin; consolidated revenue, revenue\\n \\ngrowth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; free cash flow; and\\n \\nchanges to earnings reports. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and\\n \\nuncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our\\n \\nability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;\\n \\nmaintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our\\n \\nservice; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,\\n \\nincluding consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed\\n \\ndiscussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ\\n \\nmaterially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and\\n \\nExchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange\\n \\nCommission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on February 8,\\n \\n2019.

Our existing plans remain ad free.\\n●Netflix has higher engagement than any other streamer – with room for growth:\\n○In the UK, Netflix accounts for 8.2% of video viewing, 2.3x Amazon and 2.7x Disney+;1\\n○In the US, Netflix accounts for 7.6% of TV time, 2.6x Amazon and 1.4x Disney + Hulu +Hulu Live.2\\n●Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large,successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix\\'s $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit.\\nAfter a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth. The key is pleasingmembers. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When ourseries and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and staywith us.\\n2Based onNielsen’s Gauge, as of August 20221Based on reporting fromBARB, as of September 2022\\n1\\nQ3 R esults\\nOur 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 5% increase in average paid membershipsand a 1% rise in ARM. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), revenue and ARM grew 13% and3\\n8% year-over-year, respectively. The sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to F/X. Weunder-forecasted paid net additions, which totaled 2.4 million vs. our 1.0m forecast and compared to4.4m in the year ago quarter.\\n●In APAC, revenue grew 19% excluding F/X as average paid memberships rose 23% year-over-year.ARM was -3% year-over-year, excluding F/X, partially driven by lower ARM in India, somewhatoffset by higher ARM in Australia and Korea. We added 1.4m paid memberships in the region (vs.2.2m last Q3).\\n●Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM grew 13% and 7%, respectively. Paid net adds totaled0.6m vs. 1.8m in the year ago quarter.\\n●In LATAM, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, supported by ARM growth of 16% vs. the yearago quarter excluding F/X. We added 0.3m paid memberships, in-line with membership growthin Q3’21.\\n●In UCAN, our most penetrated market, ARM and revenue grew by 12% and 11%, respectively,excluding F/X. Paid net adds totaled 0.1m (similar to the 0.1m in Q3’21).\\nFor Q3, operating income totaled $1.5 billion vs. $1.8 billion in Q3’21. Operating income was above ourbeginning-of-quarter forecast, partially due to higher revenue, as well as a shift in timing of some spendfrom Q3 to Q4. As a result, operating margin of 19% was above our 16% forecast. The four percentagepoint year-over-year decline in operating margin is almost entirely due to the appreciation in the USdollar vs. most other currencies during this period. EPS of $3.10 vs. $3.19 a year ago included a $348million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\nQ4 F orecast\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.The appreciation of the US dollar remains a significant headwind for us (and US-based multinationals ingeneral). For Q4’22, we’re expecting revenue of $7.8 billion with the sequential decline entirely due tothe continued strengthening of the US dollar vs. other currencies. On a constant currency basis, thisequates to 9% year-over-year revenue growth.\\nOur revenue growth forecast is driven by our expectation for 4.5m paid net adds (vs. 8.3m in Q4’21) andARM growth of 6% year-over-year, excluding F/X. Our paid net adds forecast assumes that we experienceour usual seasonality as well as the impact of a strong content slate, counterbalanced by macroeconomicweakness which leads to less-than-normal visibility. While we’re very optimistic about our newadvertising business, we don’t expect a material contribution in Q4’22 as we’re launching our Basic withAds plan intra-quarter and anticipate growing our membership in that plan gradually over time. Our aim\\n3ARM\\n(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n2\\nis to give our prospective new members more choice - not switch members off their current plans.Members who don’t want to change will remain on their current plan, without ads, at the current price.\\nWe forecast Q4’22 operating margin of 4% vs. 8% in the year ago period. The fourth quarter is typicallyour lowest operating margin quarter of the year as it’s usually our largest quarter in terms of content andmarketing spend. In addition, the aforementioned F/X impact has a high flow through to operatingincome (~75%-80% of the revenue impact) as most of our costs are in US dollars. Excluding theyear-over-year impact of F/X, our Q4’22 operating margin forecast would be 10% vs. 8% in Q4’21.\\nTheUS dollar has strengthenedagainst most othercurrencies at a historic rate this year. Based on ourYTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negativelyimpact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively.\\nAs a reminder, our 2022 and 2023 operating margin target of 19%-20% is based on F/X rates in January2022, as we discussed in ourQ4’21 letterand subsequentearnings calls. We’re on track to meet this F/Xneutral operating margin objective for 2022 (excluding the $150m of restructuring costs in Q2) and for2023. With the appreciation of the US dollar though, our reported operating margin would be lower than19%-20% should the US dollar remain above January 2022 levels relative to other currencies.\\nOver the medium term, we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollarworld. Our long term goal remains unchanged - to sustain double digit revenue growth, increaseoperating profit even faster (as we expand margins) and deliver growing positive free cash flow.\\nGuidanc e EvolutionAs discussed in previous letters, we are increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top line metric.This will become particularly important heading into 2023 as we develop new revenue streams likeadvertising and paid sharing, where membership is just one component of our revenue growth. So,\\n3\\nstarting with our Q4’22 letter in January of 2023, we’ll continue to provide guidance for revenue,operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and fully diluted shares outstanding for thefollowing quarter, but not paid membership. Similar to our regional membership disclosure, we’llcontinue to report our global and regional membership each quarter as part of our earnings release.\\nContent & Mark eting\\nWe started our original programming strategy about a decade ago as we anticipated that somecompetitors would eventually stop licensing their content to Netflix. It’s been a huge challenge to build alifetime of entertainment in just ten years in multiple languages and across so many different genres\\n-series, films, animation, stand-up and non-fiction. And while we’ve had our share of misses, we’vemanaged to create a very broad slate with many great series and films, for whatever your mood ortastes, from amazing storytellers around the world. Given everything we’ve learned, we’re confident wecan deliver even more member value per content investment dollar over time.\\nOne of the best ways to understand the success of our content is by understanding our engagement. Sowe’re excited that BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board), the leading audience measurementand video ratings organization in the UK, is now reporting the share of video viewing for streamingservices and broadcast groups in the UK on a monthly basis. In September, Netflix accounted for 8.2% ofviewing, and we have more than 2x the monthly engagement of our next closest streaming competitor.This reporting is similar to Nielsen’s Gauge, which launched in May 2021 when Netflix accounted for 6%of viewing compared to 7.6% in August 2022. Our hope is that other measurement companies aroundthe world will join Nielsen and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming and theviewing share of relevant entertainment companies.\\nWe think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles.This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love. As theGoogle Trends chartshows, theability to watch all ofMonster: The Jeffrey DahmerStoryhelped drive significant interest in the show.\\n4\\nIt’s hard to imagine, for example, how a Korean title likeSquid Gamewould have become a mega hitglobally without the momentum that came from people being able to binge it. We believe the ability forour members to immerse themselves in a story from start to finish increases their enjoyment but alsotheir likelihood to tell their friends, which then means more people watch, join and stay with Netflix.\\nOur Q3 content slate was especially strong. In English scripted TV, we kicked off the quarter withStranger ThingsS4, which generated 1.35 billion hoursviewed- our biggest season of an English4\\nlanguage series ever. This was followed in August byThe Sandman(351 million hours viewed), which wasloved by fans and critics alike. Near the end of the quarter, we launched season five of fan favoriteCobraKai(270 million hours viewed) and limited seriesMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story*(824 million hoursviewed) from Ryan Murphy, which is now our second largest English series.\\nWe continue to see great success with our non-English programming too, withSquid Gamemakingawards history by becoming the first foreign language title to win an Emmy - withsix awards, includingfor directing, production design and lead actor. Also from Korea,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, a uniqueseries about an autistic lawyer, has reached #1 on our weekly non-English series list in 28 countries,notching up 402 million hours viewed and making it our sixth largest non-English TV show ever through28 days.Narco-Saintshas been another huge K-Contentwin this quarter, with 128 million hours viewedsince launch.Sintoniahas been a big hit for Netflixin Brazil, with season three generating 38 millionhours viewed. And while it is still early days for German seriesThe Empress*, it launched with a verystrong start (136 million hours viewed). Our goal is to create authentic local stories for members in thehome territory, which we also make available globally.\\nFilm is incredibly important to our members. We expanded into original film in 2016 because producingour own movies across all budgets and genres has advantages over the next best alternative: onlylicensing from other studios in the first pay TV window (the “pay-one” window). Those advantagesinclude first window availability on Netflix (pay-one movies debut generally well after theatrical release),global rights (pay-one movies are licensed by country), the ability to carry the films on Netflix inperpetuity (typically only for 18-24 months for pay-one films) and copyright ownership, enabling us tocreate derivatives like sequels and to use the intellectual property (IP) in games and consumer products.We continue to complement our original films with 3rd party licensed films - they remain an importantand valued part of our service, but they are just one component of our broader programming strategy.\\nWe’re pleased with the progress of our original film initiative. The big budget action filmThe Gray Man(254 million hours viewed) reflects the scope of our ambition to create theatrical quality blockbustersthat can reach huge audiences on Netflix: 118 million households (many of which are multi person) ifyou divide the total hours viewed by the film’s run time of 2 hours and 9 minutes. But since we’re notlimited by the need to optimize for theatrical attendance, we can also produce a wider variety of filmsthat consumers can enjoy. For example, the romantic dramaPurple Heartswas a hit among ourmembers with 229 million  hours viewed. We’re at an even earlier stage with animated feature films butin early Q3 we releasedThe Sea Beast(165 millionhours viewed), which is our biggest original animated\\n4Hours viewed data is based on viewing in the first 28 days of release for each episode. For titles released less than28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through October 16, 2022. We publish weekly our toptitles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10, whereyou can also find our detailed methodology.\\n5\\nfilm to date. On the non-English language film side,Darlings(33 million hours viewed), starring AliaBhatt, launched to rave reviews and huge fandom in India.Loving Adults(67 million hours viewed), apsychological thriller from Denmark, andCarter(65million hours viewed), a Korean blockbuster, wereour two biggest non-English films of the quarter and are now our seventh and ninth most popularnon-English films ever.\\nWe also continue to invest heavily in marketing, with a particular focus on innovative ways to driveconversation around our titles, which in turn boosts engagement for Netflix. For example, our campaigns forStranger ThingsS4 andThe Gray Mandrove more than9.8 billion and 1.2 billion impressions, respectively,across paid marketing, social media platforms and events. And content forTudum, our global fan eventthatran for its second year in September, generated almost1 billion views- up over 30% from last year.\\nBeyond TV and movies, we’re coming up on the one year anniversary of our gaming launch. As we’vesaid, this will be a multi-year journey for us to learn how to please game players. Our first year was aboutestablishing our gaming infrastructure and understanding how our members interact with games. Wenow have 35 games on service (all included in every Netflix subscription without in-game ads or in-apppurchases) and we’re seeing some encouraging signs of gameplay leading to higher retention.\\nWith 55 more games in development, including more games based on Netflix IP, we’re focused in thenext few years on creating hit games that will take our game initiative to the next level. More generally,we see a big opportunity around content that crosses between TV or film and games. For example, afterthe launch of the animeCyberpunk: Edgerunners(49million hours viewed) in Q3use of CD Projekt’sgame surgedon PCs.\\nProduct and Pricing\\nAs we’ve been discussing over the past few quarters, improving our pricing strategy is an importantnear-term focus. Last week, weannouncedthat we’llbe launching an ad-supported subscription plan onNovember 1 in Canada and Mexico; November 3 in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea,the UK, and the US; and November 10 in Spain. Cumulatively, these 12 markets account for ~$140 billionof brand advertising spend across TV and streaming, or over 75% of the global market.5\\nTo start, we’re keeping it simple by offering one low-priced ad plan – Basic with Ads – at a price that’s20%-40% below our current starting price. So in the US, for example, Netflix will now start at $6.99 permonth (compared to $9.99 today). The Basic with Ads plan will have ~5 minutes of advertising per hour,frequency capping and strong privacy protections.\\nThe reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice,especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue andoperating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plansad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue.\\nFinally, we’ve landed on a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing and we’ll begin rolling thisout more broadly starting in early 2023. After listening to consumer feedback, we are going to offer the\\n5Excluding China and Russia, where we don’t operate.\\n6\\nability for borrowers to transfer their Netflix profile into their own account, and for sharers to managetheir devices more easily and to create sub-accounts (“extra member”), if they want to pay for family orfriends. In countries with our lower-priced ad-supported plan, we expect the profile transfer option forborrowers to be especially popular.\\nCompe tition\\nAs we’ve long said, we operate in a highly competitive industry, where people have many differententertainment choices – from linear TV to streaming, YouTube to TikTok and gaming to social media. Thesilver lining is that the opportunity is very large and growing, and Netflix is still very small relative to thatopportunity (for example, ~8% of total TV time in the US and the UK, two of our most establishedcountries). In the 190 countries in which we operate, our $30 billion-plus of annual revenue is roughly5% of the combined estimated ~$300 billion pay TV/streaming industry, ~$180 billion brandedadvertising market, and $130 billion consumers spend annually on gaming. So, we believe that we have6\\na long runway for growth if we can continue to improve our offering steadily over time.\\nAs it’s become clear that streaming is the future of entertainment, our competitors – including mediacompanies and tech players – are investing billions of dollars to scale their new services. But it\\'s hard tobuild a large and profitable streaming business – our best estimate is that all of these competitors arelosing money on streaming, with aggregate annual direct operating losses this year alone that could bewell in excess of $10 billion, compared with our +$5-$6 billion of annual operating profit. For incumbententertainment companies, this high level of investment is understandable given the accelerating declineof linear TV, which currently generates the bulk of their profit.\\nUltimately though, we believe some of our competitors will seek to build sustainable, profitablebusinesses in streaming - either on their own or through continued industry consolidation. While it’searly days, we’re starting to see this increased profit focus - with some raising prices for their streamingservices, some reigning in content spending, and some retrenching around traditional operating modelswhich may dilute their direct-to-consumer offering. Amidst this formidable, diverse set of competitors,we believe our focus as a pure-play streaming business is an advantage. Our aim remains to be the firstchoice in entertainment, and to continue to build an amazingly successful and profitable business.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $557 million vs. $82 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)amounted to $472 million,compared with -$106 million in Q3’21. We7\\ncontinue to expect FCF of +$1 billion for the full year 2022, plus or minus a few hundred million dollarsand substantial growth in FCF in 2023 (assuming no further material appreciation of the US dollar) .\\nGross debt at quarter end was $14 billion, within our $10-$15 billion target range.

We believe we have a clear path toreaccelerate our revenue growth: continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix, launching paid sharing andbuilding our ads offering. As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building evengreater profitability over time.\\n1As defined by cumulative view hours in the first 28 days\\n1\\nTed Sar andos and Gr eg P eters as our c o-CE Os\\nTo complete our succession process, Reed Hastings has become Executive Chairman, and Greg Peters hasstepped up from COO to become Ted Sarandos’ co-CEO, and a member of the Netflix board. Reed, Greg,and Ted have been working closely together for 15 years, and this makes formal externally how we havebeen operating internally. More details are here on ourblog.\\nTed said: “I want to thank Reed for his visionary leadership, mentorship and friendship over the last 20years. We’ve all learned so much from his intellectual rigor, honesty and willingness to take big bets –and we look forward to working with him for many more years to come. Since Reed started to delegatemanagement to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values andlike-minded approach to growth. I am so excited to start this new chapter with Greg as co-CEO.”\\nGreg said: \"I feel humbled and privileged to become co-CEO of Netflix. Ted and I have worked togetherfor many years – building tremendous trust and respect for each other. We\\'re also motivated by thesame goal: a desire to better serve our members so that we can continue to grow our business.”\\nIn addition to these changes, Bela Bajaria, formerly Head of Global TV, has become Chief Content Officerand Scott Stuber has become Chairman of Netflix Film. Ted said: “Bela and Scott are outstanding creativeexecutives with proven track records at Netflix. In 2022 we premiered many of our most popular seriesand films in Netflix history, including Wednesday, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Purple Hearts,Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, The Adam Project and Harry & Meghan – a testament to theirleadership and creativity. I couldn’t be more excited to work alongside them as we seek to delightaudiences for years to come.”\\nFor full details of Netflix leadership seehere.\\nQ4 R esults\\nYear over year revenue growth of 2% in Q4 (10% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis) was driven2\\nby a 4% increase in average paid memberships. ARMdeclined 2% year over year, but grew 5% on a F/X3\\nneutral basis2. Revenue was slightly above our beginning-of-quarterprojection, as paid net adds of 7.7M(vs. 8.3M in Q4’21) came in higher than our 4.5M forecast, due to both strong acquisition and retention,driven primarily by the success of our Q4 content slate. In addition, the US dollar depreciated vs. mostother currencies during the quarter, which resulted in slightly higher than projected ARM.\\nOperating income of $550M in Q4 was down vs. $632M in Q4 ‘21. This was above our guidance forecastof $330M primarily due to higher than expected revenue as well as slower-than-forecasted hiring.Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 7% compared to 8% in Q4’21. This year over year decline was dueto the appreciation of the US dollar. For the full year 2022, our operating margin amounted to 18% vs.\\n3ARM\\n(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n2Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchangerate movements. Assumes foreign exchange ratesremained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period.\\n2\\n21% in FY21. Based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022 and excluding the $150M in restructuringcharges in Q2’22, this translates into an operating margin of 20%, at the high end of the 19%-20% targetwe set inJanuary of 2022.\\nF/X Neutral Operating Margin (Excluding Restructuring Charges in Q2 2022)\\n* Based on F /X rates at the beginning of each y ear (and e xcluding the $150M of r estructuring c osts in Q2 2022). Not e: Ex cludesF/X impact on c ontent amortiz ation, as titles ar e amortiz ed a t a his torical blended r ate based on timing of spend.\\nEPS in Q4’22 was $0.12 vs. $1.33 in Q4‘21. This was below our $0.36 forecast due to a $462M non-cashunrealized loss from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt as a result of thedepreciation of the US dollar vs. the Euro during Q4’22. As a reminder, our approximately $5B of Eurobonds provides us with some natural hedge on the relative value of the Euro for net income. However, itdoesn’t affect operating income as unrealized gains or losses are recognized below operating income in“interest and other income.” For the full year, we recognized a non-cash unrealized gain of $353M fromthe F/X remeasurement on our Euro bonds.\\nForecast\\nAs we noted in our Q3’22 shareholder letter, revenue is our primary top line metric, particularly as wedevelop additional revenue streams where membership is just one component of our growth (likeadvertising and paid sharing). The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at thetime we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the rollout of major new initiatives (paidsharing and ads) plus current uncertain macroeconomic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility.\\nWe forecast Q1’23 revenue growth of 4% (8% on a F/X neutral basis). We expect our F/X neutral revenuegrowth to be driven by a combination of year over year growth in average paid memberships and ARM.This translates into modest positive paid net adds in Q1 ‘23 (vs. paid net adds of -0.2M in Q1’22). Our\\n3\\nexpectation of fewer paid net adds in Q1’23 vs. Q4’22 is consistent with normal seasonality and factorsin our strong member growth in Q4’22, which likely pulled forward some growth from Q1’23.\\nIn addition, we expect to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1’23 (more details below in theProduct and Pricing section). We anticipate that this will result in a very different quarterly paid net addspattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2’23 than in Q1’23. From our experience inLatin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing, whichimpacts near term member growth. But as borrower households begin to activate their own standaloneaccounts and extra member accounts are added, we expect to see improved overall revenue, which isour goal with all plan and pricing changes.\\nOur long term financial objectives remain unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expandoperating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. For the full year 2023, as we continue toimprove our service, grow our advertising business and launch paid sharing, we expect constant currencyrevenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. We also expect year over year operating profitgrowth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F/X).\\nWe have been targeting a FY23 operating margin of 19%-20% based on F/X rates at the beginning of2022. We now expect to deliver roughly 21%-22% operating margin on this basis (above the 19%-20%range). Rolling forward to F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, this translates into a FY23 operating margintarget of 18%-20%. For Q1’23, we expect operating margin to be down year over year (20% vs. 25%) dueprimarily to the timing of content spend.\\nContent and Mark eting\\nPeople have more choice of films and TV shows than ever so we need to ensure that there’s alwayssomething great for them to watch on Netflix, regardless of their taste, mood, or who they’re watchingwith. It’s why we’re so focused on continuing to improve our content and broaden our slate. 2022\\'ssuccessful slate was the result of having the best creative executives working with best in class creators.Last year alone we launched:4\\n●Five of our Top 10 most popular English language TV seasons ever –Stranger Things 4andWednesday(both of which hit 1B hours viewed), Monster:The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,BridgertonS2 andInventing Anna– as well asHarry & Meghan,our second most successful doc series ever;\\n●Four of our Top 10 most popular English language films ever–The Adam Project, The Gray Man,Purple HeartsandGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery– as well asThe Sea BeastandThe TinderSwindler, our most successful animated and documentaryfilms respectively;\\n●Seven of our Top 10 most popular non-English films ever –Troll(Norway),All Quiet on theWestern Front(Germany),Black Crab(Sweden),ThroughMy Window(Spain),The Takedown(France),My Name is Vendetta(Italy), andLovingAdults(Denmark);\\n●Two of our Top 10 most popular non-English TV shows ever–All of Us Are DeadandExtraordinary Attorney Woo, both from Korea.\\n4For View Hours for these titles, please visitNetflixTop 10.\\n4\\nWe’re also pleased with the progress we’ve made with returning titles. Members watched more Netflixreturning seasons and sequels in 2022 than ever before across a broad range of genres – from film (EnolaHolmes2,Lost Bullet2 and two365 Dayssequels) and unscripted (Selling SunsetS5 andLove is BlindS3)to award winning drama (OzarkS4 andThe CrownS5),local language series (SintoniaS3,Young RoyalsS2andAlice in BorderlandS2, whose success pushed S1back into the Top 10 after its launch) and animation(Big MouthS6).\\nIt’s hard to think of two titles that more successfully pierced the zeitgeist this year thanStranger Things4andWednesday. Both pushed old songs into the musiccharts: Kate Bush’sRunning Up That Hillwent tonumber 1 on Billboard’s Global charts for the first time, 37 years after it was first released, and LadyGaga’sBloody Marymade it onto the Billboard top40 list for the first time ever, 11 years after it was firstreleased. We get amazing results when we have aWednesday,Glass OnionorMonstermoment with ourmembers. We believe people typically sign up for a streaming service because they’ve heard about a title“you simply must watch” from a friend, seen the excitement on social media or read about it in thepress. Generating conversation is our primary marketing goal because we see that it drives acquisitionand encourages existing members to watch more, which in turn helps with retention. For Ryan Murphy’sThe Watcher, conversation about the series led tofans flocking to the house, aSaturday Night Livespoofand a spike inhome security sales. OurWednesdaycampaign, with all our marketing in Wednesday’siconic voice, generated 1.5B organic social impressionspre-launch, a record for a Netflix season one.Over time, we hope to have more and more of these moments across film and TV, and to replicate thesesuccesses on the games side.\\nIt’s now slightly over a year since we launched games on the Netflix service. We’ve madegood progressin that time - creating the infrastructure to deliver games to mobile devices, building a portfolio of 50games across many genres and acquiring four game studios to bolster our internal productioncapabilities. In Q4, we launched season four of unscripted seriesToo Hot to Handle,which was a top 10title for us globally for three consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, we debuted ourToo Hot to Handlegame, which has been our biggest game launch to date and is another encouraging sign in the long termopportunity to entertain members with Netflix intellectual property (IP) across different mediums. In2023, we’ll continue toexpand our offeringwith moregames, with a focus on Netflix-related IP.\\nProduct and Pricing\\nAs discussed over the past few quarters, we’re working to give people more choice when it comes toprice as well as greater control over their Netflix account. In November, we successfully launched ournew, lower priced ad-supported plan in 12 countries. We believe branded television advertising is asubstantial long term incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Netflix, and our ability to stand upthis business in six months underscores our commitment both to give members more choice and toreaccelerate our growth.\\nWhile it’s still early days for ads and we have lots to do (in particular better targeting and measurement),we are pleased with our progress to date across every dimension: member experience, value toadvertisers, and incremental contribution to our business. Engagement, which is consistent withmembers on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected and we believe the lower\\n5\\nprice point is driving incremental membership growth. Also, as expected, we’ve seen very little switchingfrom other plans. Overall the reaction to this launch from both consumers and advertisers has confirmedour belief that our ad-supported plan has strong unit economics (at minimum, in-line with or better thanthe comparable ad-free plan) and will generate incremental revenue and profit, though the impact on2023 will be modest given that this will build slowly over time.\\nLater in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing(100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as buildour business. While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change formembers who share their account more broadly. So we’ve worked hard to build additional new featuresthat improve the Netflix experience, including the ability for members to review which devices are usingtheir account and to transfer a profile to a new account. As we roll out paid sharing, members in manycountries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t livewith. As is the case today,allmembers will be ableto watch while traveling, whether on a TV or mobiledevice.\\nAs we work through this transition – and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don’tconvert to extra members or full paying accounts – near term engagement, as measured by third partieslike Nielsen’s The Gauge, could be negatively impacted. However, we believe the pattern will be similarto what we’ve seen in Latin America, with engagement growing over time as we continue to deliver agreat slate of programming and borrowers sign-up for their own accounts.\\nCompe tition\\nWe continue to operate in a highly competitive market as consumers have a vast number ofentertainment choices. Beyond our direct streaming competitors, we also vie for consumers’ timeagainst linear TV, YouTube, short form entertainment like TikTok, and gaming, to name just a few. Thesilver lining is that the market for entertainment is huge and Netflix is still very small by comparison. Forexample, in the more than 190 countries we operate in, our $30B+ of annual revenue compares againstthe combined annual estimated ~$300B pay TV/streaming industry, $180B branded TV advertising spendand $130 billion consumer spend on gaming.5\\nIt’s not easy to build a large and profitable streaming business. But we’re competing from a position ofstrength, as we lead the industry in terms of engagement, revenue and streaming profit. As a pure-playstreaming company, we’re also not anchored to shrinking legacy business models, like traditionalentertainment firms, allowing us to lean hard into the big growth opportunity ahead of us.\\nAs we’ve said before, beyond revenue and profitability, another way to look at our business is throughengagement, and we are pleased to have Kantar join Nielsen – who have expanded their efforts – andBARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming as well as the viewing share ofdifferent entertainment companies in Brazil, Mexico, and Poland.\\n5Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludeshardware sales.\\n6\\nAs can be seen in the newly reported markets of Mexico, Brazil, and Poland, we are less than 5% of TVviewing. And in our largest markets like the US and the UK, we are still less than 10% of TV screen time.As one of the leaders in streaming across all markets, we’re encouraged by the fact that streamingoverall accounts for less than 40% of viewing across these markets (and as little as 6% in Poland). Webelieve ultimately the vast majority of time spent on TV will happen via streaming, which should providea long runway for growth as we continue to improve our service.\\nSour ce: Nielsen (US,Mexico,Poland), Kantar (Brazil),BARB (UK).

Free cash flow (FCF)for Q4 totaled $0.3B, compared with -$0.6Bin6\\nthe year ago quarter. For FY22, we generated FCF of $1.6B (vs. -$0.2B in FY21), above our forecast ofapproximately $1B.\\nNow that we are a decade into our original programming initiative and have successfully scaled it, we arepast the most cash intensive phase of this buildout. As a result, we believe we will now be generatingsustained, positive annual free cash flow going forward. Assuming no material swings in F/X, we expectat least $3B of FCF for the full year 2023.\\nWe closed two previously announced acquisitions in Q4 - leading animation studioAnimal Logicandgames studioSpry Fox. We funded these purchases fromcash on hand.\\n6Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activitiesless purchases of property and equipment and changein other assets.\\n7\\nGross debt at quarter end totaled $14B, in-line with our targeted range of $10-$15B. With cash and shortterm investments of $6B, net debt totaled $8B, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA.We don’t have any scheduled debt7\\nmaturities in FY23 and only $400M of debt maturities in FY24. All of our debt is fixed rate.\\nOur capital structure policy is unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core businessand to fund new opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintainingminimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (e.g., about $5.2B based on Q4 revenue).After meeting those needs, we intend to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases.Assuming no material acquisitions, we anticipate resuming our share buyback program in 2023.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nTwo years ago we increased our focus on sustainability and related initiatives– building a team of8\\nexperts, announcing an ambitious environmentalcommitment,and exploring creative-friendly ways toreduce emissions in our productions (which account for more than half of our emissions as a company).As a result,Netflix production sets are becomingmore sustainablethrough cleaner technologies,including electric vehicles and clean alternatives to diesel generators.\\nIn 2021, we created theNetflix Fund for CreativeEquity, committing $100M over five years to furtherdevelop our pipeline for underrepresented talent.  Through the fund, Netflix supports externalorganizations committed to creating equitable opportunities in the TV and film industries, as well asbespoke Netflix programsthat help us to identify,train and provide job placement for emerging talentglobally.

Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are importantliquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that isavailable to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain otheractivities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F/X neutral revenue and operating marginallows investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currencyfluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as asubstitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per shareand net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared inaccordance with GAAP.

       "  'content': 'January 21, 2020\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\nWe had a strong finish to 2019, with Q4 revenue growing 31% year over year, bringing full year 2019\\n \\nrevenue to over $20 billion, while FY19 operating income rose 62% to $2.6 billion. During the quarter,\\n \\nwe surpassed 100 million paid memberships outside of the US. Streaming entertainment is a global\\n \\nphenomenon and we’re working hard to build on our early progress.\\n \\n \\n \\nQ4 Results and Q1 Forecast\\n \\nIn Q4, average streaming paid memberships grew 21% year over year while streaming ARPU increased\\n \\n9% year over year. Excluding a -$133 million impact from foreign currency, streaming ARPU rose 12%\\n \\nyear over year. Operating income in Q4 amounted to $459m (vs. $216m last year). While this was\\n \\nslightly lower than our beginning-of-quarter forecast of $475m, we’re primarily managing by our full\\n \\nyear operating margin target, which we met (13% in FY19 vs. 10% in FY18).\\n \\n \\nEPS for Q4 amounted to $1.30 vs. $0.30 a year ago. During Q4, the US Treasury issued final regulations\\n \\non certain aspects of the 2017 US tax reform. As a result, we had over-accrued in the first three quarters\\n \\nof 2019 for tax, which was adjusted in Q4, resulting in our n\\n\\u200b\\net income being higher than operating\\n \\nincome this quarter. We paid US corporate taxes for the full year inclusive of this Q4 adjustment.\\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nGlobal paid net additions totaled 8.8m in Q4, on par with the 8.8m in the prior year period and ahead of\\n \\nour forecast of 7.6m, fueled by our broad slate of original programming and the worldwide adoption of\\n \\nstreaming video. We generated Q4-record paid net adds in each of the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions,\\n \\nwhile UCAN paid net adds totaled 0.55m (with 0.42m in the US) vs. 1.75m in the year ago quarter. Our\\n \\nlow membership growth in UCAN is probably due to our recent price changes and to US competitive\\n \\nlaunches. We have seen more muted impact from competitive launches outside the US (NL, CA, AU). As\\n \\nalways, we are working hard to improve our service to combat these factors and push net adds higher\\n \\nover time.\\n \\n \\n \\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.\\n \\nFor Q1’20, we forecast global paid net adds of 7.0m vs. 9.6m in Q1’19, which was an all-time high in\\n \\nquarterly paid net adds. Our Q1’20 forecast reflects the continued, slightly elevated churn levels we are\\n \\nseeing in the US plus an expectation for more balanced paid net adds across Q1 and Q2 this year, with\\n \\nseasonality more similar to 2018 than 2019. This is due in part to the timing of last year’s price changes\\n \\nand a strong upcoming Q2 content slate, where we’ll have some of our bigger titles like \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa De Papel\\n \\n(aka \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n) season 4.\\n \\n \\nWe’re targeting a 16% operating margin in 2020 (up 300 basis points year over year). As a reminder,\\n \\nlarge swings in foreign exchange (F/X) could lead to some temporary variations from our annual margin\\n \\nprogression, partially because we don’t spend on derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half\\n \\nof our revenue is not in US dollars.\\n \\nContent\\n \\nGreat content grows engagement among our members, which we believe drives word-of-mouth,\\n \\nimproves retention and grows paid memberships. We have many exciting releases for Q1’20 including\\n \\n2\\n \\nreturning seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nSex Education\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n\\u200b\\n Altered Carbon\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nNarcos: Mexico\\n\\u200b\\n, the Spanish series \\n\\u200b\\nElite\\n\\u200b\\n and Korean\\n \\nhistorical zombie thriller \\n\\u200b\\nKingdom,\\n\\u200b\\n as well as action film \\n\\u200b\\nSpenser Confidential\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Mark Wahlberg)\\n \\nand the movie sequel \\n\\u200b\\nTo All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You\\n\\u200b\\n. New original series include the recently\\n \\nreleased \\n\\u200b\\nMessiah\\n\\u200b\\n and the buzzy docu-series \\n\\u200b\\nKiller Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez\\n\\u200b\\n and the\\n \\nupcoming \\n\\u200b\\nI Am Not Okay with This.\\n \\nThese titles build off of a highly successful Q4 content slate, which included new seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown,\\n \\nBig Mouth\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nYou\\n\\u200b\\n and new series and films like \\n\\u200b\\nRhythm & Flow\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nAmerican Son\\n\\u200b\\n, Turkish series \\n\\u200b\\nThe Gift\\n \\nand French film \\n\\u200b\\nBanlieusards \\n\\u200b\\n(aka \\n\\u200b\\nStreet Flow\\n\\u200b\\n). The psychological thriller \\n\\u200b\\nYou\\n\\u200b\\n, which originated on US\\n \\nlinear TV with a modest audience, has evolved into a global phenomenon on Netflix; we estimate, based\\n \\non the first few weeks, 54m member households will choose to watch season 2 in its first 4 weeks. In its\\n \\nfirst four weeks, over 21m member households have chosen to watch season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n (up over\\n \\n40% from Season 2 over the same time period) and in total, over 73m households worldwide have\\n \\nchosen \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n since the series launched. \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n and the all new Season 3 cast just won the\\n \\nScreen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama series and star Olivia Colman won the Golden\\n \\nGlobe for Best Actress in a Drama Series.\\n \\n \\nDuring December, we also launched \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n, which is tracking to be \\n\\u200b\\nour biggest season one TV\\n \\nseries ever\\n\\u200b\\n. Through its first four weeks of release, 76m member households chose to watch this\\n \\naction-packed fantasy, starring Henry Cavill. As a testament to how our hit content can penetrate the\\n \\nglobal zeitgeist and influence popular culture, the show’s launch drove up sales of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nbooks\\n \\nand \\n\\u200b\\ngames\\n\\u200b\\n around the world, and spawned a viral musical \\n\\u200b\\nhit\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nOur Q4 movie slate set a new bar for the variety and high quality of films we produce to appeal to our\\n \\nmembers’ many different tastes. We released \\n\\u200b\\n6 Underground\\n\\u200b\\n, from director Michael Bay and starring\\n \\nRyan Reynolds, and 83m member households chose this crowd-pleasing action film through its first four\\n \\nweeks. The exceptional breadth and quality of our film slate was recognized as we led all studios with 24\\n \\nAcademy Award nominations across eight different films. The nominated feature films produced by the\\n \\nNetflix studio like \\n\\u200b\\nThe Irishman\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nMarriage Story\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Two Popes \\n\\u200b\\nwere also very popular with our\\n \\nmembers. Having launched our original film initiative just under five years ago, this is a proud\\n \\nachievement and a testament to the creative talent with whom we partner\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nAcross both film and TV, we were also recognized for being the home for storytellers and creators from\\n \\nmany diverse backgrounds. We’re honored to lead the industry in nominations at both the \\n\\u200b\\nNAACP Image\\n \\nAwards\\n\\u200b\\n (42 nominations) and the \\n\\u200b\\nGLAAD Media Awards\\n\\u200b\\n (15 nominations).\\n \\n \\nWe know that local audiences love local stories. In fact, local originals were the most popular 2019 titles\\n \\nin many countries, including India, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Thailand, Sweden and the UK. In addition,\\n \\nwe\\'ve seen how members all around the world also love these stories with \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel/Money\\n \\nHeist\\n\\u200b\\n appearing on our top ten lists in more than 70 countries. K-content is also popular globally, and\\n \\nwe\\'re investing heavily in Korean stories. In this past quarter, we inked a TV output deal with JTBC, a\\n \\nleading Korean media company, and a strategic partnership with CJ ENM’s Studio Dragon, Korea’s\\n \\nlargest TV studio. These deals will enable us to bring more K-dramas to fans all over the world.\\n \\n3\\n \\nOver the past several years, we’ve been developing an animation studio within Netflix to produce a wide\\n \\narray of animated content for kids, adults and families. We have amazing creators with pedigree from\\n \\nDisney Animation, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination now working at Netflix on their next\\n \\nbig projects. In Q4, we debuted filmmaker Sergio Pablos’ \\n\\u200b\\nKlaus\\n\\u200b\\n, our first original feature-length\\n \\nanimated film that was also nominated for an Academy Award. In its first 28 days, 40m members chose\\n \\nto watch this heartwarming Santa Claus origin story. Later in 2020, we’ll premiere the ambitious \\n\\u200b\\nOver\\n \\nThe Moon\\n\\u200b\\n, from legendary animator Glen Keane, followed by a schedule that builds to several big\\n \\nanimated feature films per year.\\n \\nAs we’ve expanded our original content, we’ve been working on how to best share content highlights\\n \\nthat demonstrate popularity. Given that we now have titles with widely varying lengths - from short\\n \\nepisodes (e.g. \\n\\u200b\\nSpecial\\n\\u200b\\n at around 15 minutes) to long films (e.g. \\n\\u200b\\nThe Highwaymen\\n\\u200b\\n at 132 minutes), we\\n \\nbelieve that reporting households viewing a title based on 70% of a single episode of a series or of an\\n \\nentire film, which we have been doing, makes less sense. We are now reporting on households\\n \\n(accounts) that chose to watch a given title\\n. Our new methodology is similar to the BBC iPlayer in their\\n \\n1\\nrankings\\n\\u200b\\n based on “requests” for the title, “most popular” articles on the New York Times which include\\n \\nthose who opened the articles, and YouTube view counts. This way, short and long titles are treated\\n \\nequally, leveling the playing field for all types of our content including interactive content, which has no\\n \\nfixed length. The new metric is about 35% higher on average than the prior metric. For example, 45m\\n \\nmember households chose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nOur Planet\\n\\u200b\\n under the new metric vs. 33m under the prior metric.\\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nIn Product, we are investing our resources to grow engagement and our storytelling capabilities (like the\\n \\nbranching narratives in \\n\\u200b\\nBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\\n\\u200b\\n), deepen our penetration in key markets and help\\n \\nour members find great content through better suggestions. To do this, we try many approaches; in\\n \\n2019 alone, we conducted hundreds of product tests to try to improve our member experience from\\n \\nsign up to billing and payments to content discovery. About 30% of these led to a gain in retention,\\n \\nengagement or revenue, up from 20% in the prior year. It’s a humbling exercise as so many of our ideas\\n \\ndo not “win” with members, but this helps tune our judgment and innovation priorities for the future.\\n \\n \\nIn Q4, we launched a mobile-only plan in Malaysia and Indonesia (which we introduced to India in Q3\\n \\nlast year). We’ve seen similar results with this plan driving incremental subscriber growth and improving\\n \\nretention. We expect the mobile-only plan to be revenue-positive which will allow us to further invest in\\n \\ncontent to be enjoyed by our members and continue to feed the virtuous cycle. We plan to continue to\\n \\ntest adding this plan, as well as additional ideas in other countries around the world.\\n \\nCompetition\\n \\n \\nMany media companies and tech giants are launching streaming services, reinforcing the major trend of\\n \\nthe transition from linear to streaming entertainment. This is happening all over the world and is still in\\n \\nits early stages, leaving ample room for many services to grow as linear TV wanes. We have a big\\n \\n1\\n Chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes -- long enough to indicate the choice was intentional\\n \\n-- is the precise definition\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nheadstart in streaming and will work to build on that by focusing on the same thing we have focused on\\n \\nfor the past 22 years - pleasing members. We believe if we do that well, Netflix will continue to prosper.\\n \\nAs an example, in Q4, despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per\\n \\nmembership grew both globally and in the US on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters.\\n \\nBelow is a comparison of \\n\\u200b\\nGoogle search trends\\n\\u200b\\n for \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n, Disney’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Mandalorian\\n\\u200b\\n, Amazon’s\\n \\nJack Ryan\\n\\u200b\\n and Apple’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Morning Show\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nSource: Google Trends. Note: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+ are global x-China, while Disney+ is only in NL, US, CA, and AU. If\\n \\nDisney+ were global we don’t think the picture would be much different, to judge from the \\n\\u200b\\nNL results\\n\\u200b\\n where Disney+ first launched.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nIn Q4, net cash used in operating activities was -$1.5 billion vs. -$1.2 billion in the prior year period. Free\\n \\ncash flow (FCF)\\n in Q4 totaled -$1.7 billion vs. -$1.3 billion in Q4’18. For the full year, FCF was -$3.3\\n \\n2\\nbillion which we believe is the peak in our annual FCF deficit.\\n \\n \\nOur plan is to continually improve FCF each year and to move slowly toward FCF positive. For 2020, we\\n \\ncurrently forecast FCF of approximately -$2.5 billion. Along the way, we’ll continue to use the debt\\n \\nmarket to finance our investment needs as we did in Q4’19, when we raised $1.0 billion 4.875% senior\\n \\nnotes and \\n€\\n1.1 billion 3.625% senior notes, both due in 2030. With our FCF profile improving, this means\\n \\nthat over time we’ll be less reliant on public markets and will be able to fund more of our investment\\n \\nneeds organically through our growing operating profits.\\n \\n \\n2\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the\\n \\nreconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n \\n5\\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2019\\n\\u200b\\n,  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2019\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJanuary 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2018\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nAppendix\\n \\nTable 1\\n\\xa0\\n \\n \\n6\\n \\nTable 2 (Final letter for this table)\\n\\xa0\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7\\n \\nJanuary 21, 2020 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST\\n \\nOur video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm\\n \\nPST today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are\\n \\nimportant liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated\\n \\nthat is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the\\n \\namount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of\\n \\nthese non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial\\n \\nstatements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding global paid net additions; churn; seasonality;;\\n \\ndistribution of net adds across quarters; full-year operating margin target; future content offerings;\\n \\nproduct tests; revenue impact of product changes; future capital raises; reliance on public markets for\\n \\ncash needs; impact of competition; global streaming paid memberships and growth; consolidated\\n \\nrevenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and\\n \\npeak free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties\\n \\nthat could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract\\n \\nnew members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and\\n \\nexpansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service\\n \\ndisruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including\\n \\nconsumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion\\n \\nof these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially\\n \\nfrom such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange\\n \\n8\\n \\nCommission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange\\n \\nCommission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on February 8,\\n \\n2019.

       "  'content': 'October 19, 2021\\nFellow shareholders,\\nAfter a lighter-than-normal content slate in Q1 and Q2 due to COVID-related production delays in 2020,we are seeing the positive effects of a stronger slate in the second half of the year. In Q3, we grewrevenue 16% year over year to $7.5 billion, while operating income rose 33% vs. the prior year quarter to$1.8 billion. We added 4.4m paid net adds (vs. 2.2m in Q3’20) to end the quarter with 214m paidmemberships. We’re very excited to finish the year with what we expect to be our strongest Q4 contentoffering yet, which shows up as bigger content expense and lower operating margins sequentially.\\nQ3 R esults and Q4 F orecast\\nRevenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 9% and 7% increase in average paid streaming memberships andARM, respectively. Excluding a foreign exchange (FX)impact of +$128m, ARM rose 5% year over year.1\\nOperating margin for Q3 amounted to 23.5%, a three percentage point increase vs. the year ago period.This was above our beginning of quarter forecast due to the timing of content spend, as well as lowerthan forecasted marketing spend. EPS of $3.19 vs. $1.74 a year ago included a $136m non-cashunrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\nWe under-forecasted paid net adds for the quarter (4.4m actual vs. our 3.5m projection), while endingpaid memberships of 214m was within 0.4% of our forecast. For the second consecutive quarter, theAPAC region was our largest contributor to membership growth with 2.2m paid net adds (half of totalpaid net adds) as we are continuing to improve our service in this region. In EMEA, paid net adds of 1.8mimproved sequentially vs. the 188k in Q2 as several titles had a particularly strong impact. The UCAN and\\n1ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nLATAM regions grew paid memberships more slowly. These regions have higher penetration ofbroadband homes although we believe we still have ample runway for growth as we continue to improveour service.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we reportand we strive for accuracy. For Q4’21, we forecast paid net adds of 8.5m, consistent with Q4’20 paid netadditions. For the full year 2021, we forecast an operating margin of 20% or slightly better. This meansthat Q4’21 operating margin will be approximately 6.5% compared with 14% in Q4’20. The year overyear decline in operating margin is due mostly to our backloaded big content release schedule in this Q4,which will result in a roughly 19% year over year increase in content amortization for Q4’21 (comparedwith ~8% growth year to date).\\nContent\\nOur programming strategy is to provide members with a wide variety of high quality content that’s lovedand watched in large numbers. Season five ofLa Casade Papel(akaMoney Heist) and season three ofSex Educationwere two of our biggest returning showsin the quarter with 69m and 55m memberhouseholds, respectively, choosing to watch these fan favorites in the first four weeks. On the heels ofThe Queen’s Gambit, we’ve had another limited serieshit withMaidwhich launched just afterquarter-end on October 1. We expect this story about living on the poverty line by award-winningplaywright and screenwriter Molly Smith Metzler to reach 67m households during its first four weeks.\\nLa Casa de Papelwas our first non-English languagetitle to show that - with subtitling and dubbing -great stories truly can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. We are now producing local TVand film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communitiesaround the world. While the goal of our local content executives is always to create locally authenticstories that will resonate in their country (likeThe Chestnut Manwhich we expect to be watched by\\n2\\napproximately two thirds of our Danish members during its first four weeks), Netflix is a global,direct-to-consumer service which enables creators to reach broader audiences - and gives our membersan even greater choice of stories to enjoy.\\nThere is no better example of this thanSquid Game,a unique Korean story that first captured thezeitgeist in Korea and then globally. Released on September 17, it has becomeour biggest TV show ever.A mind-boggling142mmember households globally havechosen to watch the title in its first four weeks.The breadth ofSquid Game’s popularity is truly amazing;this show has been ranked as our #1 program in94 countries (including the US). Like some of our other big hits,Squid Gamehas also pierced the culturalzeitgeist, spawning aSaturday Night Liveskitandmemes/clips on TikTokwith more than 42 billion views.Demand for consumer products to celebrate the fandom forSquid Gameis high and those items are ontheir way to retail now.\\nOur film slate also continues to build with a variety of successful Q3 titles such as action filmSweetGirlstarring Jason Momoa (68m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks),Kissing Booth 3(59m), the last installment in the rom com trilogy, the animated family filmVivo(46m) andBlood RedSky, a German-language action horror movie (53m).\\nLater in the year, we will shift to reporting on hours viewed for our titles rather than the number ofaccounts that choose to watch them. There is some difference in rankings, as you see below, but wethink engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of ourtitles and member satisfaction. It also matches how outside services measure TV viewing and givesproper credit to rewatching. In addition, we will start to release title metrics more regularly outside ofour earnings report so our members and the industry can better measure success in the streamingworld.\\n3\\n* Total hour s vie wed per title in its fir st 28 da ys on Ne tflix. ** The number of acc ounts tha t have watched a t leas t two minut esof tha t title in its fir st 28 da ys on Ne tflix. Da ta as of 9/27/21.\\nWe’re honored to have garnered the most Emmys ever for any single network or service in a season oftelevision, with 44 (tying CBS’ tally in 1974 when there were only three national networks). This includedour first best Drama series win (The Crown), whileThe Queen’s Gambitwon 11 out of 18 nominations,including the coveted best limited series. Both titles are among our most popular ever, demonstratingcritical and commercial success.\\nDuring Q3, we announced our agreement to acquire theRoald Dahl Story Company, pending regulatoryapproval. This was an opportunity to purchase a beloved and enduring portfolio of intellectual propertyincludingCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,Matilda,The BFG,James and the Giant Peach,Fantastic Mr.FoxandThe Twits, to name just a few. Roald Dahl’sbooks have been translated into 63 languages andhave sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. Once we close, we’ll be looking to develop evenmore of these stories into new formats across the live action television and films, animation andpre-school categories.\\nWe’ve begun testing our games offering in select countries. It remains very early days for this initiativeand, like other content categories we’ve expanded into, we plan to try different types of games, learnfrom our members and improve our game library. During Q3, we acquiredNight School Studio, themaker of critically acclaimed games likeOXENFREE,to help build out our game development capabilities.\\n4\\nAs a reminder, games on Netflix will be included in members’ subscriptions and will not haveadvertisements or in-app purchases so game play is purely focused on enjoyment versus monetization.\\nWe’re eagerly anticipating the rest of our Q4 slate, which includes a great mix of popular returningEnglish language series likeThe Witcher,You, TigerKingandCobra Kai, big returning non-English serieslikeSintoniaand the final chapter ofLa Casa dePapel(akaMoney Heist), as well as exciting new moviessuch as the action filmRed Notice(starring DwayneJohnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds),Don’t LookUpwith an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio,Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill,Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep, as well asThe Harder They FallfeaturingJonathanMajors, Zazie Beetz, LaKeith Stanfield, Regina King and Idris Elba,Army of Thieves(the prequel to ourhitmovie,Army of the Dead) andThe UnforgivablestarringSandra Bullock, Viola Davis and Jon Bernthal.The latest films from acclaimed directors Jane Campion (The Power Of The Dog) and Paolo Sorrentino(The Hand of God) are also coming to Netflix in Q4.\\nAssuming no new Covid waves or unforeseen events that result in large scale production shutdowns, wecurrently anticipate a more normalized content slate in 2022, with a greater number of originals in 2022vs. 2021 and a release schedule that is more balanced over the course of the year, as compared to 2021.\\nProduct\\nWe try many different approaches to see what might help our growth. One example in Q3 was thelaunch of a free plan for mobile users in Kenya. This plan is a great way for anyone in Kenya with anAndroid mobile phone to explore Netflix - with access to great content, personalized recommendations,and parental controls. We hope that this encourages more people to sign up for a paid membership sothat they can watch Netflix on any device (mobile, TV, or laptop), access more features (e.g. downloads)and enjoy our entire catalog. It will take a year or two to determine if this technique helps our paidmembership growth or not.\\nWe know that members most value the variety and quality of our content. Great recommendations arekey to ensuring they can experience that breadth and diversity. So we continue to invest in ourrecommendations to ensure members can easily find great stories to enjoy on our service. One exampleof our ability to surface relevant programming isManifest, a TV series that aired on NBC for threeseasons and was subsequently cancelled in June 2021. We addedManifestto our service in the US andCanada during the summer of 2021. In the UCAN region, 25m member households chose to watch thistitle in its first 28 days and we’ve ordered a fourth and final season given the popularity of the show.\\nMark eting & Communic ations\\nIn addition to having best in class content and a product experience that allows members to easily findshows and movies they love, we also want our programming to be talked about and in the culturalzeitgeist. In September, we held our first global fan event,TUDUM, which featured news, first looksandtrailers from over 100 of the most anticipated Netflix films and series of the next 12 months. TUDUMwas a new way for us to connect fans with our titles, talent and brand and to drive conversation at aglobal scale and trended at #2 globally the day of the event on Twitter. Additionally, TUDUM and the\\n5\\ntrailers/content released following the event were watched by fans in over 180 countries, generatingclose to 700m views and more than 3 billion impressions in less than four days.\\nCompe tition\\nWe compete with a staggeringly large set of activities for consumers’ time and attention like watchinglinear TV, reading a book, browsing TikTok, or playing Fortnite, to name just a few. As one example of thisdynamic, on October 4, when Facebook experienced a global outage for several hours, our engagementsaw a 14% increase during this time period.\\nWe are still quite small, with a lot of opportunity for growth; in our largest and most penetrated market,according to Nielsen, we are still less than 10% of US television screen time. Our approach as always is toimprove our service as quickly as we can so that we can earn a greater share of people’s time.\\nShare of Total US TV Time, September 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+)\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $82 million vs. $1.3 billion in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)for the quarter was-$106 million vs. $1.1 billion in Q3‘20. FCF in last year’s2\\nQ3 was helped by COVID-related production shutdowns. Year to date FCF is $410m. With productionvolume ramping successfully and a lower operating margin in Q4, we anticipate Q4 ‘21 FCF to benegative. We continue to expect full year 2021 FCF to be approximately breakeven (plus or minus severalhundred million dollars depending on the timing of production starts and related cash spending oncontent). We anticipate being FCF positive on an annual basis in 2022 and beyond.\\n2\\nFor a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes \\nthereto.\\n6\\nAs we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund ourday-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repurchased 0.2m shares for $100 million. Our slowerbuyback pace this quarter reflects the pick up in our M&A activity. As a reminder, we prioritize our cashto reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selectiveacquisitions. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above and beyond our minimum cash levelswill be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nIn March, we committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022 and to reduceour emissions to be in line with the latest climate science, ensuring that our internal reductions are\\nconsistent with a trajectory of no more than 1.5\\n℃\\n of warming. We’ve been making progress on thisinitiative.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures,during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, makestrategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However,this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superiorto, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in)operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to theGAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unauditedfinancial statements.\\nForward-Looking StatementsThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federalsecurities laws, including statements regarding our expected results for the fiscal quarter and yearending December 31, 2021; investment in our service; average revenue per membership; adoption ofinternet entertainment and impact on growth; competitive position; future content offerings, includinggames, and the number, timing and performance of such offerings; product enhancements and offerings;cash spending on content; stock repurchases; impact of production delays; emissions commitments;future capital and external financing needs; debt; global streaming paid memberships, paid netadditions, membership growth and retention; consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income,operating margin, net income, content amortization and earnings per share; and free cash flow.

       "  'content': \"July 16, 2020\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\nWe live in uncertain times with restrictions on what we can do socially and many people are turning to\\n \\nentertainment for relaxation, connection, comfort and stimulation. In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant\\n \\npull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million\\n \\npaid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million). As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020\\n \\ncompared to the prior year. As we navigate these turbulent circumstances, we’re focused on our\\n \\nmembers by continuing to improve the quality of our service and bringing new films and shows to\\n \\npeople's screens. Our Q2 summary results and forecast for Q3 are in the table below.\\n \\n \\n \\nTed Sarandos appointed co-CEO and elected to Board of\\n \\nDirectors\\n \\nTed joined Netflix over 20 years ago, and we are thrilled to appoint him to be co-CEO with Reed.  “Ted\\n \\nhas been my partner for decades. This change makes formal what was already informal -- that Ted and I\\n \\nshare the leadership of Netflix,” says Hastings.  Lead Independent director Jay Hoag says “Having\\n \\nwatched Reed and Ted work together for so long, the board and I are confident this is the right step to\\n \\nevolve Netflix’s management structure so that we can continue to best serve our members and\\n \\nshareholders for years to come.”\\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nTed will also continue to serve as Chief Content Officer. In addition, Greg Peters has been appointed\\n \\nCOO adding to his Chief Product Officer role. “We want Greg to help us stay aligned and effective as we\\n \\ngrow so quickly around the world,” said Hastings.\\n \\nQ2 Results and Q3 Forecast\\n \\nIn Q2, revenue grew 25% year over year, while quarterly operating income exceeded $1 billion. Average\\n \\nstreaming paid memberships in Q2 rose 25% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 0.4% year\\n \\nover year. Excluding a -$289m impact from foreign exchange (F/X), streaming ARPU grew 5% year over\\n \\nyear. Operating margin expanded 770 basis points year over year to 22.1%, above our guidance forecast\\n \\ndue to higher than expected membership and revenue growth. In addition, content and marketing\\n \\nexpenses were lower than we expected, as the pandemic delayed some planned spend. EPS of $1.59 vs.\\n \\n$0.60 a year ago included a $119m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro\\n \\ndenominated debt and a $220m non-cash valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (due to recent\\n \\nlegislation limiting the use of California R&D credits). Our Q2 effective tax rate of 30.5% includes about a\\n \\n21% point negative impact due to the valuation allowance.\\n \\n \\nWe added a Q2-record 10.1m paid memberships vs. 2.7m in last year’s Q2. The positive variance relative\\n \\nto our 7.5m forecast was due to better-than-forecast acquisition and retention. In the first half of this\\n \\nyear, we’ve added 26m paid memberships, nearly on par with the 28m we achieved in all of 2019.\\n \\nHowever, as we expected (and can be seen in the graph below), growth is slowing as consumers get\\n \\nthrough the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions. Our paid net additions for the month of June\\n \\nalso included the subscriptions we \\n\\u200b\\ncancelled\\n\\u200b\\n for the small percentage of members who had not used the\\n \\nservice recently.\\n \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nThe quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for\\n \\naccuracy. We forecast 2.5m paid net adds for Q3’20 vs. 6.8m in the prior year quarter. As we indicated in\\n \\nour Q1’20 letter, we’re expecting paid net adds will be down year over year in the second half as our\\n \\nstrong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year. In\\n \\naddition, Q3’19 included the positive impact of new seasons of both \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de\\n \\nPapel (\\n\\u200b\\naka\\n\\u200b\\n Money Heist)\\n\\u200b\\n. We continue to view the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not\\n \\nthat meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment which we believe\\n \\nprovides us with many years of strong growth ahead.\\n \\n \\nFor the full year 2020, we’re still targeting a 16% operating margin. We’re currently on track to exceed\\n \\n16% although F/X (and the relative strength of the US dollar) remains a wildcard. As always, our\\n \\nintention is to grow our annual operating margin year over year - we’re currently targeting 19% for\\n \\n2021.\\n \\nContent\\n \\nAs the world slowly re-opens, our main business priority is to restart our productions safely and in a\\n \\nmanner consistent with local health and safety standards to ensure that our members can enjoy a\\n \\ndiverse range of high quality new content. Given the significant differences between countries (e.g.,\\n \\nincidence of new Covid-19 cases, availability of testing, government and industry regulations), there is\\n \\nno one-size-fits-all approach, and we’re adapting to local circumstances.\\n \\n \\nToday, we’re slowly resuming productions in many parts of the world. We are furthest along in Asia\\n \\nPacific (where we never fully shut down in Korea, for example) and are now shooting live action series\\n \\nlike season 2 of our Japanese original \\n\\u200b\\nThe Naked Director\\n\\u200b\\n. In EMEA, we are now back in production in\\n \\nmany countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Italy, and the UK. While we recently resumed\\n \\nproduction on two films in California and two stop-motion animation projects in Oregon and expect\\n \\nsome more of our US productions to get going this quarter, current infection trends create more\\n \\nuncertainty for our productions in the US. Parts of the world like India and some of Latin America are\\n \\nalso more challenging and we are hoping to restart later in the year in these regions.\\n \\nSince our content production lead time is long, our 2020 plans for launching original shows and films\\n \\ncontinue to be largely intact. For 2021, based on our current plan, we expect the paused productions\\n \\nwill lead to a more second half weighted content slate in terms of our big titles, although we anticipate\\n \\nthe total number of originals for the full year will still be higher than 2020. We’ll also round out our\\n \\ncontent offering with film acquisitions like \\n\\u200b\\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\\n\\u200b\\n from Aaron Sorkin and \\n\\u200b\\nThe\\n \\nSpongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run\\n\\u200b\\n (global excluding US and China). We also acquired nearly\\n \\ncompleted seasons of unreleased original series like \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai \\n\\u200b\\n(seasons 1, 2 and a brand new season 3)\\n \\nand \\n\\u200b\\nEmily in Paris \\n\\u200b\\nstarring Lily Collins.\\n \\n \\nThe pandemic and pauses in production are impacting our competitors and suppliers similarly. With our\\n \\nlarge library of thousands of titles and strong recommendations, we believe our member satisfaction\\n \\nwill remain high.\\n \\n3\\n \\nIn Q2, we notched successes in many of our key content verticals. In English scripted TV, \\n\\u200b\\nNever Have I\\n \\nEver\\n\\u200b\\n, a fun, young adult dramedy from Mindy Kaling, broke through with 40m households choosing to\\n \\nwatch this show in its first four weeks, and 40m households for our new comedy \\n\\u200b\\nSpace Force\\n\\u200b\\n (starring\\n \\nSteve Carell). On the heels of \\n\\u200b\\nLove is Blind\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nToo Hot to Handle\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nFloor is Lava\\n\\u200b\\n are the latest in our line\\n \\nof buzzy unscripted shows (51m and a projected 37m households, respectively, in the first four weeks).\\n \\n \\nIn original films, 27 million households chose to watch Spike Lee’s \\n\\u200b\\nDa 5 Bloods\\n\\u200b\\n, which was celebrated as\\n \\na “\\n\\u200b\\nsoul stirring film for the ages\\n\\u200b\\n.” \\n\\u200b\\nExtraction\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Chris Hemsworth) and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Wrong Missy\\n\\u200b\\n, a comedy\\n \\nstarring David Spade and Lauren Lapkus, were also big hits with audiences (99m and 59m households,\\n \\nrespectively, chose to watch in their first 28 days). In addition, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Willoughbys\\n\\u200b\\n (38m households in the\\n \\nfirst four weeks) is an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster\\n \\nour offering for kids and families.\\n \\n \\nWe also saw increased viewing for some older titles like \\n\\u200b\\n13th\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nAmerican Son\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nDear White People\\n\\u200b\\n - all\\n \\npart of our \\n\\u200b\\nBlack Lives Matter Collection\\n\\u200b\\n - as our members sought out stories that speak to racial\\n \\ninjustice and the Black experience in America.\\n \\n \\nOur local language originals - like \\n\\u200b\\nDark\\n\\u200b\\n in Germany, \\n\\u200b\\nControl Z\\n\\u200b\\n in Mexico, \\n\\u200b\\nExtracurricular\\n\\u200b\\n in Korea, \\n\\u200b\\nThe\\n \\nWoods\\n\\u200b\\n in Poland, or \\n\\u200b\\nBlood & Water\\n\\u200b\\n in South Africa - continue to be highly impactful, driving large\\n \\nviewing, buzz and sign-ups in their home countries. We continue to see these stories find audiences all\\n \\nover the world. The best example of this was \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist): Part 4\\n\\u200b\\n, which we\\n \\nlaunched on April 3; through its first 28 days, 65m households chose to watch this hit show.\\n \\n \\nFor Q3, we recently released \\n\\u200b\\nThe Old Guard\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Charlize Theron), which continues our recent string\\n \\nof adrenaline-filled action movies. Later in July, we’re looking forward to launching season 2 of \\n\\u200b\\nThe\\n \\nUmbrella Academy\\n\\u200b\\n, followed by \\n\\u200b\\nThe Kissing Booth 2\\n\\u200b\\n (the sequel to our hit romantic comedy), \\n\\u200b\\nProject\\n \\nPower\\n\\u200b\\n (an action movie starring Jamie Foxx) and \\n\\u200b\\nEnola Holmes\\n\\u200b\\n (featuring Millie Bobbie Brown as the\\n \\nsister of Sherlock Holmes, played by Henry Cavill) later in the quarter.\\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe continue to test different pricing approaches in some countries including lower priced, mobile-only\\n \\nplans and our bundled offerings with MVPDs and ISPs. While some of these carry lower ARPU, the goal is\\n \\nto accelerate membership growth on neutral-to-better short term revenue (with incremental acquisition\\n \\nand improved retention offsetting the lower price). We think this strategy will increase long term\\n \\nrevenue as a larger membership base can generate more word-of-mouth around our content and help\\n \\nus better understand peoples’ needs in that country - so that we can more quickly improve our catalog\\n \\nand product experience, which would then lead to higher member satisfaction and growth as well as\\n \\nimproved long term retention.\\n \\n \\nA very small percentage of our members have not watched anything for the last two years and although\\n \\nwe make it easy for people to cancel their subscriptions with just a few clicks, they have not taken\\n \\nadvantage of that ability. So we decided to stop billing them and will do so for members meeting the\\n \\nsame criteria going forward. Like all of our former members, they can easily restart their membership in\\n \\nthe future. While this change resulted in a slight hit to revenue, we believe that pro-consumer policies\\n \\n4\\n \\nlike this are the right thing to do and that the long term benefits will outweigh the short term costs. In a\\n \\nworld where consumers have many subscriptions, auto-pause on billing after an extended period of\\n \\nnon-use should be how leading services operate.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nAll of the major entertainment companies like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal are pushing their\\n \\nown streaming services and two of the most valuable companies in the world, Apple and Amazon, are\\n \\ngrowing their investment in premium content. In addition, TikTok’s growth is astounding, showing the\\n \\nfluidity of internet entertainment. Instead of worrying about all these competitors, we continue to stick\\n \\nto our strategy of trying to improve our service and content every quarter faster than our peers. Our\\n \\ncontinued strong growth is a testament to this approach and the size of the entertainment market.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash generated in operating activities in Q2 was +$1 billion vs. -$544 million in the prior year period.\\n \\nFree cash flow\\n was positive for a second consecutive quarter at +$899m vs. -$594 million. Free cash\\n \\n1\\nflow was higher than net income due primarily to the loss on FX remeasurement and the valuation\\n \\nallowance for deferred tax assets, both of which were non-cash items that reduced net income.\\n \\n \\nOur FCF profile is continuing to improve, which is being driven in part by our growing operating margin\\n \\nand the digestion of our big move into the production of Netflix originals that requires more cash\\n \\nupfront vs. licensed content. In addition, the pause in production has also pushed out cash spending on\\n \\ncontent into the second half of 2020 and into 2021.\\n \\nDue to the pause in production from the pandemic combined with higher-than-forecast paid net adds\\n \\nyear to date, we now expect free cash flow for the full year 2020 to be breakeven to positive, compared\\n \\nwith our prior expectation for -$1 billion or better. As we indicated last quarter, in 2021 we project that\\n \\nfull year free cash flow will dip back to being negative again, although we believe the FCF deficit will be\\n \\nmaterially better than our peak deficit level of -$3.3 billion in 2019. There has been no material change\\n \\nin our overall estimated timetable to reach consistent annual positive FCF within the next few years.\\n \\n \\nWe’re often asked by investors what our FCF profile would be at “steady state” or when our cash\\n \\ncontent spending matches our content amortization. The pandemic and the resulting pause in\\n \\nproductions provides one early snapshot of what that may look like. In Q2’20, our cash spending on\\n \\ncontent was $2.6 billion, equivalent to our content amortization of $2.6 billion, or a 1x cash\\n \\ncontent-to-content amortization ratio\\n. This resulted in a FCF margin of +15% in Q2. Of course, our plan\\n \\n2\\nis to continue to grow our content spend (as we don’t believe we are anywhere near maturity), but the\\n \\nabove analysis may prove illustrative. And by the time our cash content-to-content amortization ratio\\n \\n1\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer\\n \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes\\n \\nthereto.\\n \\n2\\n For additional details on these concepts, please refer to our Content Accounting Overview slide deck on\\n \\nour investor relations \\n\\u200b\\nsite\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n5\\n \\nreaches 1x on a sustained basis (which is still many years away), we hope to have many more members\\n \\nand much greater revenue, operating margin and FCF.\\n \\n \\nIn April, we raised $1 billion of debt at a blended rate of ~3.3% across both US dollar and Euro tranches.\\n \\nWe ended Q2 with more than $7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.\\n \\n \\nAs part of our commitment to racial equity, we allocated about two percent of our cash holdings -\\n \\ninitially up to $100 million - into financial institutions and organizations that directly \\n\\u200b\\nsupport Black\\n \\ncommunities\\n\\u200b\\n in the US. We hope other US large-caps will also consider taking this small and relatively\\n \\neasy step to bolster US racial economic equity.\\n \\n \\nWith our cash balance, $750 million credit facility (which remains undrawn) and improving FCF profile,\\n \\nwe have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for over 12 months. As a result, we don’t expect to\\n \\naccess the debt markets for the remainder of 2020 and we believe our need for external financing is\\n \\ndiminishing.\\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2020\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2020\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2019\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJuly 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2018\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n6\\n \\nRegional Breakdown\\n \\n \\n \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 16, 2020 Earnings Interview, 3pm PT\\n \\nOur video interview with Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays Capital will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm\\n \\nPT today.  \\n\\u200b\\nQuestions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to\\n \\nkannan.venkateshwar@barclayscapital.com. \\n\\u200b\\nReed Hastings, co-CEO, Spence Neumann, CFO, Ted\\n \\nSarandos, co-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Greg Peters, COO and Chief Product Officer and Spencer\\n \\nWang, VP of IR/Corporate Development will all be on the video to answer Kannan’s questions.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7\\n \\nIR Contact:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSpencer Wang\\n \\n  VP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development\\n \\n  408 809-5360\\n \\n \\n \\nPR Contact:\\n \\n \\nRichard Siklos\\n \\nVP,  Communications\\n \\n      408 540-2629\\n \\n \\n \\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free\\n \\ncash flow and adjusted EBITDA.

However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

       "  'content': \"July 17, 2019\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\nAs expected, revenue growth accelerated 400 basis points to 26%, and operating income increased 53%\\n \\nyear over year in Q2. Paid membership grew by 2.7m, less than the 5.5m in Q2 a year ago and our 5.0m\\n \\nforecast. In Q3, we expect to grow by 7m paid memberships, more than the 6.1m in Q3 a year ago.\\n \\nConsumers around the world continue to move from linear television to internet entertainment at a\\n \\nremarkable rate.\\n \\n \\n \\nQ2 Results and Q3 Forecast\\n \\nAverage streaming paid memberships increased 24% year over year, while ARPU increased 3% year over\\n \\nyear on a reported basis. Excluding the year over year foreign exchange (F/X) impact on revenue of\\n \\n-$265 million, global streaming ARPU grew 9%, with 12% and 7% ARPU growth in the US and\\n \\ninternational segments, respectively. Operating margin of 14.3% (up 250 bps year over year) was higher\\n \\nthan our beginning-of-quarter forecast as some marketing spend was shifted into the second half of the\\n \\nyear. EPS amounted to $0.60 vs. $0.85 and included a $61 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X\\n \\nremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming content obligations decreased 2%\\n \\nsequentially, reflecting our shift to more owned (vs. licensed) content.\\n \\n1\\n \\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.\\n \\nWe strive for accuracy (not conservatism), which means that in some quarters we will be high and other\\n \\nquarters low relative to our guidance. In Q2’19, our membership growth forecast was high.\\n \\n \\n \\nOur missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases. We don’t\\n \\nbelieve competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape\\n \\nduring Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our\\n \\nover-forecast was in every region). Rather, we think Q2’s content slate drove less growth in paid net\\n \\nadds than we anticipated. Additionally, Q1 was so large for us (9.6m net adds), there may have been\\n \\nmore pull-forward effect than we realized. In prior quarters with over-forecasts, we’ve found that the\\n \\nunderlying long-term growth was not affected and staying focused on the fundamentals of our business\\n \\nserved us well.\\n \\n \\nQ3 has started with \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n season 3, and the first two weeks of Q3 are strong. In addition to\\n \\nthe recently released season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n, our second half content slate includes new seasons of\\n \\nLa Casa de Papel\\n\\u200b\\n (\\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n), \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n, and the final season of the iconic \\n\\u200b\\nOrange is the New Black\\n\\u200b\\n as\\n \\nwell as big films like \\n\\u200b\\nThe Irishman\\n\\u200b\\n from Martin Scorsese and action movie \\n\\u200b\\n6 Underground\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by\\n \\nMichael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds).\\n \\n \\nWhile our US paid membership was essentially flat in Q2, we expect it to return to more typical growth\\n \\nin Q3, and are seeing that in these early weeks of Q3. We forecast Q3 global paid net adds of 7.0m, up\\n \\nvs. 6.1m in Q3’18, with 0.8m in the US and 6.2m internationally. Our internal forecast still currently calls\\n \\nfor annual global paid net adds to be up year over year. There’s no change to our 13% operating margin\\n \\ntarget for FY19, up 300 basis points year over year.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nOur Q2 content slate featured several highly watched titles. We launched \\n\\u200b\\nDead to Me\\n\\u200b\\n, a dramedy\\n \\nstarring 2019 Emmy nominated Best Actress Christina Applegate, which was watched by 30m\\n \\nhouseholds in its first four weeks. We’ve renewed this half hour comedy for a second season. We’re also\\n \\nproud of \\n\\u200b\\nWhen They See Us\\n\\u200b\\n, a moving limited series based on the Central Park Five case, from Ava\\n \\nDuVernay. This powerful story was watched by 25m households in its first four weeks and has stirred a\\n \\nglobal conversation about race, identity, and criminal justice. \\n\\u200b\\nWhen They See Us\\n\\u200b\\n was also just nominated\\n \\nfor 16 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Limited Series. \\n\\u200b\\nOur Planet\\n\\u200b\\n was our most ambitious\\n \\nundertaking in the documentary category to date and it’s also our highest-watched original docu-series\\n \\nthrough its first four weeks (33m households) and was just nominated for 10 Emmy Awards.\\n \\nWe are making good progress with our original films portfolio with more and more of our films creating\\n \\nlarger audiences than our pay 1 licensed movies. At the end of June, we premiered our latest Adam\\n \\nSandler movie \\n\\u200b\\nMurder Mystery\\n\\u200b\\n (also starring Jennifer Aniston), which is the most watched Adam Sandler\\n \\nNetflix original film to date; over 73m households watched this film in its first four weeks. In Q2, the\\n \\nyoung adult romantic comedy movie \\n\\u200b\\nThe Perfect Date\\n\\u200b\\n (featuring Noah Centineo from our big film \\n\\u200b\\nTo All\\n \\nThe Boys I’ve Loved Before\\n\\u200b\\n) was a global hit with 48m households in its first four weeks. Similarly, Ali\\n \\nWong co-starred with Randall Park in \\n\\u200b\\nAlways Be My Maybe \\n\\u200b\\n(directed by Nahnatchka Khan), which was\\n \\nviewed by 32m households in its first four weeks.\\n \\n \\nSeason 2 of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Rain\\n\\u200b\\n was among the largest returning seasons for one of our non-English language\\n \\noriginals, while Swedish series \\n\\u200b\\nQuicksand\\n\\u200b\\n was a new show that was highly watched both locally and\\n \\nglobally. We also debuted several local-language titles that were very popular in their home territories\\n \\nlike the first two installments of the \\n\\u200b\\nHistoria de un Crimen \\n\\u200b\\nfranchise (\\n\\u200b\\nHistoria de un Crimen: Colosio\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n \\n3\\n \\nHistoria de un Crimen: Colmenares\\n\\u200b\\n) in Latin America, while \\n\\u200b\\nFamily Business\\n\\u200b\\n was a breakthrough hit for us\\n \\nin France.\\n \\n \\nWe’ve been moving our content from semi-exclusive catalog and 2nd-window unbranded content to\\n \\nbranded exclusive 1st window original content for many years. Much of our domestic, and eventually\\n \\nglobal, Disney catalog, as well as \\n\\u200b\\nFriends\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Office\\n\\u200b\\n, and some other licensed content will wind down\\n \\nover the coming years, freeing up budget for more original content. We don’t have material viewing\\n \\nconcentration as even our largest titles (that are watched by millions of members) account for only a\\n \\nlow single digit percentage of streaming hours. From what we’ve seen in the past when we drop strong\\n \\ncatalog content (Starz and Epix with Sony, Disney, and Paramount films, or 2nd run series from Fox, for\\n \\nexample) our members shift over to enjoying our other great content.\\n \\n \\nForty of our original series, films and specials were nominated for 117 Emmy Awards, including\\n \\nOutstanding Comedy and Drama Series, Limited Series, Animated Series and Reality Series, as well as\\n \\nVariety, Children’s, short form and interactive programs. We are incredibly proud to offer best in class\\n \\noriginal programming in so many different forms.\\n \\nMarketing\\n \\nAs Netflix has shifted to original content, our marketing has evolved to increasingly focus on launching\\n \\nour key titles to build excitement amongst existing and non-members. We’re continuing to invest in\\n \\nowned and earned media, where we can have strong, direct relationships with fans. We’re very excited\\n \\nto welcome \\n\\u200b\\nJackie Lee-Joe\\n\\u200b\\n as our new CMO to help us take our marketing to the next level.\\n \\n \\nWe’re also building out our licensing and brand partnerships effort, which is optimizing for fan and\\n \\nviewer engagement over revenue maximization. For example, for the launch of \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n season\\n \\n3, we partnered with best-in-class brands like \\n\\u200b\\nCoke\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nNike\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nBurger King\\n\\u200b\\n, and \\n\\u200b\\nBaskin Robbins\\n\\u200b\\n to build deep\\n \\nconnections with our fans.\\n \\nAt E3, the largest video gaming event of the year, we announced a new \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n mobile game, a\\n \\ngame based on our upcoming new show \\n\\u200b\\nDark Crystal: Age of Resistance \\n\\u200b\\n(a prequel to the 1982 film),\\n \\nand a partnership with Epic Games, the developers of \\n\\u200b\\nFortnite\\n\\u200b\\n. Like our other merchandising initiatives,\\n \\nthese games are designed to build fandom for our titles and don’t signal a push into gaming as a new\\n \\nbusiness for Netflix.\\n \\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe recently entered into a new partnership with AT&T in the US to integrate Netflix into their new\\n \\nset-top box. In the US, we now partner with a wide range of ISPs and MVPDs, including Comcast, DISH,\\n \\nVerizon, T-Mobile, Charter, and Altice, in addition to AT&T.\\n \\nAfter several months of testing, we’ve decided to roll out a lower-priced mobile-screen plan in India to\\n \\ncomplement our existing plans. We believe this plan, which will launch in Q3, will be an effective way to\\n \\nintroduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market\\n \\nwhere Pay TV ARPU is low (below $5). We will continue to learn more after launch of this plan.\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nOver the next 12 months, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, NBCU and others are joining Hulu, Amazon, BBC,\\n \\nHotstar, YouTube, Netflix, and many others in offering streaming entertainment. The competition for\\n \\nwinning consumers’ relaxation time is fierce for all companies and great for consumers. The innovation\\n \\nof streaming services is also drawing consumers to shift more and more from linear television to\\n \\nstreaming entertainment. If you watch \\n\\u200b\\nOur Planet\\n\\u200b\\n on a new TV with Dolby Vision or HDR10, you will see\\n \\nwhy: the quality of streaming television is spectacular. In the US, our most developed market, we still\\n \\nonly earn about 10% of consumers’ television time, and less of their mobile screen time, so we have\\n \\nmuch room for growth.\\n \\nWe, like HBO, are advertising free. That remains a deep part of our brand proposition; when you read\\n \\nspeculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be confident that this is false. We believe we will\\n \\nhave a more valuable business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue and instead\\n \\nentirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash used in operating activities in Q2’19 was -$544 million vs. -$518 million in the prior year period.\\n \\nFree cash flow (FCF)\\n totaled -$594 million vs. -$559 million in Q2’18. We’re still forecasting FCF of\\n \\n1\\napproximately -$3.5 billion for the full year 2019 and expect improvement in 2020. From there, we’ll\\n \\ncontinue to reduce our free cash flow deficit as we intend to continue growing our member base,\\n \\nrevenues, and operating margin, which provides a clear path towards positive FCF. In the meantime, our\\n \\nplan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments as we did in April. In our most recent\\n \\nround, we raised 10.5 year senior notes of \\n€\\n1.2 billion (3.875% coupon) and $900 million (5.375%\\n \\ncoupon).\\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2018\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJuly 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2017\\n\\u200b\\n,  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2017\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the\\n \\nreconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n \\n5\\n \\nAppendix\\n \\n \\nJuly 17, 2019 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST\\n \\nOur video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm\\n \\nPST today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are\\n \\nimportant liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated\\n \\nthat is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the\\n \\namount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\n6\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of\\n \\nthese non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial\\n \\nstatements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding future content offerings and evolution of our content\\n \\nmix; marketing investments; factors impacting our marginal growth; impact of competition; new pricing\\n \\nplans; remaining an advertising free service; future capital raises; US paid membership growth; US and\\n \\ninternational streaming paid memberships, paid net additions, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and\\n \\ncontribution margin; consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net\\n \\nincome, and earnings per share; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are\\n \\nsubject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without\\n \\nlimitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete\\n \\neffectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer\\n \\nusage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,\\n \\ncompetition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.\\n \\nA detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and\\n \\nevents to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the\\n \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities\\n \\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC\\n \\non February 8, 2019.

       "  'content': \"October 20, 2020\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\nAs we expected, growth has slowed with 2.2m paid net adds in Q3 vs. 6.8m in Q3’19. We think this is\\n \\nprimarily due to our record first half results and the pull-forward effect we described in our April and\\n \\nJuly letters. In the first nine months of 2020, we added 28.1m paid memberships, which exceeds the\\n \\n27.8m that we added for all of 2019. In these challenging times, we’re dedicated to serving our\\n \\nmembers.\\n \\n \\nQ3 Results and Q4 Forecast\\n \\nQ3 average streaming paid memberships rose 25%, while streaming ARPU decreased 1.6% year over\\n \\nyear. Excluding a foreign exchange (F/X) impact of -$158m, streaming ARPU increased 1% vs. prior year.\\n \\nRevenue was 2% above our beginning-of-quarter guidance primarily due to slightly higher than expected\\n \\nARPU (favorable plan mix in our UCAN, LATAM and APAC regions plus intra-quarter appreciation in the\\n \\nEuro and British pound which helped lift EMEA ARPU).  As a result, operating margin of 20% (up 170bps\\n \\nyear over year) exceeded our guidance forecast as well. EPS of $1.74 vs. $1.47 a year ago included a\\n \\n$249m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which\\n \\naccounted for the variance with our EPS guidance.\\n \\n \\nWe added 2.2m net memberships in Q3, compared with our 2.5m guidance. Retention remains healthy\\n \\nand engagement per member household was up solidly year over year in Q3’20. As a reminder, our\\n \\n1\\n \\nguidance is our internal forecast and we strive for accuracy. That means in some quarters our results will\\n \\nbe high relative to our guidance forecast and, in others, it will be low.\\n \\n \\nOur APAC region was the largest contributor to our paid membership growth this quarter (46% of Q3\\n \\nglobal paid net adds) and APAC revenue rose 66% year over year. We’re pleased with the progress we’re\\n \\nmaking in this region and, in particular, that we’ve achieved double digit penetration of broadband\\n \\nhomes in both South Korea and Japan. While this is encouraging, we still have much work to do and\\n \\nwe're working hard to replicate this success in India and other countries.\\n \\n \\nFor Q4‘20, we forecast 6.0m paid net adds vs 8.8m in Q4‘19. As we have highlighted in our recent\\n \\ninvestor letters, we believe our record first half paid net additions would result in slower growth in the\\n \\nback half of this year. If we achieve our forecast, it will put us at a record 34m paid net adds for 2020,\\n \\nwell above our prior annual high of 28.6m in 2018.\\n \\nThe state of the pandemic and its impact continues to make projections very uncertain, but as the world\\n \\nhopefully recovers in 2021, we would expect that our growth will revert back to levels similar to\\n \\npre-COVID. In turn, we expect paid net adds are likely to be down year over year in the first half of 2021\\n \\nas compared to the big spike in paid net adds we experienced in the first half of 2020. We continue to\\n \\nview quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not that meaningful in the context of the long\\n \\nrun adoption of internet entertainment, which we believe is still early and should provide us with many\\n \\nyears of strong future growth as we continue to improve our service.\\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nWe forecast Q4 operating margin of 13.5% vs. 8.4% last year, which means we’ll over-deliver this year\\n \\non our original full year margin target; our FY20 operating margin is now expected to be 18% (vs. 16%\\n \\noriginally) or a 500 basis point increase year over year. Since 2016, we will have more than quadrupled\\n \\nour annual GAAP operating margin (which is our primary profitability metric).\\n \\n \\nAs in the past, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year and at an average rate of\\n \\n300 basis points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate more lumpiness. Some years we’ll\\n \\nbe a little over (like this year when we expect to grow operating margin 500bps), some years a little\\n \\nunder, but we are trying to keep on a 300 bps per year long-term trajectory. The increased lumpiness is\\n \\ndue to increased F/X exposure from our international success and COVID’s impact on the timing of\\n \\nspending. By moving to this multi-year model, we’ll be able to manage our short term expenses more\\n \\nsmoothly as well as grow slightly more efficiently than in the past. As we wrote last quarter, for 2021,\\n \\nwe’re targeting a 19% operating margin.\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nWe are making good and careful progress returning to production, particularly in EMEA and APAC, but\\n \\nalso across much of LATAM and UCAN. We’ve restarted production on some of our biggest titles\\n \\nincluding season four of \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n, action film \\n\\u200b\\nRed Notice\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot\\n \\nand Ryan Reynolds) and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n season two. Since the almost-global shutdown of production back\\n \\nin mid-March, we have already completed principal photography on 50+ productions and, while the\\n \\ncourse and impact of C-19 remains unpredictable, we’re optimistic we will complete shooting on over\\n \\n150 other productions by year-end.\\n \\nFor our 2021 slate, we continue to expect the number of Netflix originals launched on our service to be\\n \\nup year over year in each quarter of 2021 and we’re confident that we’ll have an exciting range of\\n \\nprogramming for our members, particularly relative to other entertainment service options. As\\n \\n3\\n \\ndiscussed last quarter, some of our most popular returning titles are expected to launch in the second\\n \\nhalf of next year.\\n \\n \\nThis past quarter, the breadth of our programming was demonstrated with standout titles across many\\n \\ngenres. In English language series, we debuted new seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Umbrella Academy \\n\\u200b\\nand \\n\\u200b\\nLucifer\\n\\u200b\\n; 43m\\n \\nand 38m member households chose to watch these titles in the first 28 days, respectively. In\\n \\nmid-September, we also premiered Ryan Murphy’s \\n\\u200b\\nRatched\\n\\u200b\\n, a thriller based on the character from \\n\\u200b\\nOne\\n \\nFlew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest\\n\\u200b\\n. In its first four weeks, 48m member households chose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nRatched\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\nOur #1 and #2 most watched documentary feature films ever were released in Q3.  \\n\\u200b\\nAmerican Murder:\\n \\nThe Family Next Door\\n\\u200b\\n is projected to have 52m members households choose the title in its first 28 days\\n \\nand \\n\\u200b\\nThe Social Dilemma\\n\\u200b\\n had 38m in its first 28 days.\\n \\n \\nWe continue to invest heavily in local language content because we believe that great stories are\\n \\nuniversal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Season one of the Mexican\\n \\ntelenovela \\n\\u200b\\nOscuro Deseo\\n\\u200b\\n (\\n\\u200b\\nDark Desire\\n\\u200b\\n) was our biggest local language original globally this quarter. Our\\n \\nslate of Korean dramas continue to travel well throughout APAC and beyond, while anime is another\\n \\ncategory of content with fans all over the world.\\n \\n \\nAnother example of our content traveling around the globe is our non-fiction series \\n\\u200b\\nIndian\\n \\nMatchmaking\\n\\u200b\\n, which was watched by a quarter of our members in India and millions of members\\n \\noutside of India in its first four weeks.\\n \\n \\nOriginal film continues to be an area of opportunity for us and we had several big hits in Q3. Action\\n \\nthriller \\n\\u200b\\nThe Old Guard\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Charlize Theron and \\n\\u200b\\ndirected by Gina Prince-Bythewood\\n\\u200b\\n) was our most\\n \\npopular title of the quarter with 78m member households choosing to watch in its first four weeks. Our\\n \\nromantic comedy \\n\\u200b\\nThe Kissing Booth 2\\n\\u200b\\n received strong reception (66m member households chose to\\n \\nwatch in the first 28 days), while action film \\n\\u200b\\nProject Power\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Jamie Foxx) was also very popular\\n \\n(75m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks). Late in September, we debuted \\n\\u200b\\nEnola\\n \\nHolmes\\n\\u200b\\n, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill as her famed detective brother. We estimate 76m\\n \\nmember households will have chosen this film in the first 28 days.\\n \\n \\nOur content successes highlight our ability to tap into our global audience of nearly 200m members and\\n \\nunderscore the notion that content is \\n\\u200b\\nd i s c o v e r e d\\n\\u200b\\n on Netflix. This applies not only to Netflix originals, but\\n \\nalso to second run programming, like \\n\\u200b\\nSchitt’s Creek\\n\\u200b\\n and earlier seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nLucifer\\n\\u200b\\n, both of which are very\\n \\npopular with our members. The latest example is \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai\\n\\u200b\\n (based on \\n\\u200b\\nThe Karate Kid\\n\\u200b\\n films), which\\n \\noriginally debuted on YouTube’s subscription service in May 2018 and recently launched on Netflix on\\n \\nAugust 28. In its first four weeks of release on Netflix, 50m member households chose to watch season\\n \\none, dramatically expanding its audience.\\n \\n \\nWe’re looking forward to season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai\\n\\u200b\\n premiering exclusively on Netflix on January 8, 2021. In\\n \\naddition to the recently released \\n\\u200b\\nThe Haunting of Bly Manor\\n\\u200b\\n (a follow up to the acclaimed \\n\\u200b\\nThe Haunting\\n \\nof Hill House\\n\\u200b\\n), season one of \\n\\u200b\\nEmily in Paris\\n\\u200b\\n and Adam Sandler’s latest film \\n\\u200b\\nHubie Halloween\\n\\u200b\\n, other\\n \\nnotable Q4 titles include our animated family film \\n\\u200b\\nOver the Moon\\n\\u200b\\n from legendary creator Glen Keane\\n \\n(premiering this weekend), season four of our award-winning series \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n and the first season of\\n \\nSelena\\n\\u200b\\n. We’ll also have a great slate of films, including \\n\\u200b\\nThe Midnight Sky\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by and starring George\\n \\n4\\n \\nClooney), \\n\\u200b\\nHillbilly Elegy\\n\\u200b\\n (from Ron Howard), \\n\\u200b\\nMa Rainey’s Black  Bottom\\n\\u200b\\n (with Viola Davis and Chadwick\\n \\nBoseman), \\n\\u200b\\nThe Christmas Chronicles 2\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\n(from Chris Columbus),  \\n\\u200b\\nJingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey\\n\\u200b\\n (with\\n \\nForest Whitaker), \\n\\u200b\\nMANK\\n\\u200b\\n (David Fincher’s first feature at Netflix) and Ryan Murphy’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Prom\\n\\u200b\\n (starring\\n \\nMeryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden and Kerry Washington).\\n \\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe strive to be a global entertainment service that can satisfy the needs of members all over the world.\\n \\nCommissioning and producing local language content is an important part of that. But we also invest\\n \\nheavily into improving our product, partnerships and overall consumer experience. For example, in India\\n \\nin Q3, we localized our service to support Hindi in our user interface.\\n \\n \\nWe’re also working with local partners like Reliance Jio, India’s largest mobile operator, where in Q3 we\\n \\nlaunched a bundle with their mobile and fiber broadband plans. As part of this broad partnership, we’ll\\n \\nintegrate Netflix with two of Jio’s set top boxes. We’ve also partnered with financial institutions in India\\n \\nto make payment processing easier and more seamless for our members, which we expect will have\\n \\nretention benefits. All of these initiatives are important and work in concert with our big investment in\\n \\nlocal originals to improve the Netflix experience for our members.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nCompetition for consumers’ time and engagement remains vibrant.  Linear television and other big\\n \\ncategories of entertainment, like video games and user generated content from YouTube and TikTok are\\n \\nall vying for consumers’ attention and are strong drivers of screen time usage.  We remain quite small\\n \\nrelative to overall screen time.\\n \\n \\nThis past quarter, we saw the debut of Comcast’s Peacock, which comes on the heels of the launch of\\n \\nHBO Max and Disney+. Disney’s recent management reorganization signals that it is embracing the shift\\n \\nto streaming entertainment. We’re thrilled to be competing with Disney and a growing number of other\\n \\n5\\n \\nplayers to entertain people; both consumers and content creators will benefit from our mutual desire to\\n \\nbring the best stories to audiences all over the world.\\n \\n \\nWe’ll continue to focus on pleasing our members and improving our service as quickly as possible so\\n \\nthat we can be everyone's first choice for online entertainment.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was +$1.3 billion vs. -$502 million in the prior year\\n \\nperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)\\n was positive for a third consecutive quarter at +$1.1b vs. -$551 million in\\n \\n1\\nQ3‘19. Year to date free cash flow is +$2.2 billion vs. -$1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2019.\\n \\n \\nAs productions increasingly restart, we expect Q4’20 FCF to be slightly negative and therefore, for the\\n \\nfull year 2020, we forecast FCF to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of\\n \\nbreak-even to positive. This change is due primarily to our higher operating margin expectation for 2020\\n \\nand the timing of cash spending on content. We expect our FCF profile over the coming years to\\n \\ncontinue to improve as we increase our profitability and our transition to the production of Netflix\\n \\noriginals (which requires more cash upfront vs. second run content) matures. For 2021, we currently\\n \\nexpect free cash flow to be -$1 billion to break-even.\\n \\nWith $8.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter plus our $750m credit facility\\n \\n(which is undrawn), our need for external financing is diminishing.

However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Streaming iswinning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relativelyhigh household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts -combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streamingobscured the picture until recently. While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth - throughimprovements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing - we’ll beholding our operating margin at around 20%. Key to our success has been our ability to create amazingentertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewingthan our competitors. These are Netflix\\'s core strengths and competitive advantages. Together with ourstrong profitability, we believe we have the foundation from which we can both significantly improve,and better monetize, our service longer term.\\nGrowth Outlook\\nSince launching streaming in 2007, we’ve operated under the firm belief that internet-delivered, ondemand entertainment will supplant linear TV, and that this transition represents a once-in-a-generationopportunity to build a highly popular and profitable entertainment company. People love movies, TVshows and games; broadband and smart TV penetration continue to grow globally with more and moreconnected devices; and while hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world’sbroadband homes don’t yet, representing huge future growth potential.\\n1\\nIn the near term though, we’re not growing revenue as fast as we’d like. COVID clouded the picture bysignificantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021was due to the COVID pull forward. Now, we believe there are four main inter-related factors at work.\\nFirst, it’s increasingly clear that the pace of growthinto our underlying addressable market (broadbandhomes) is partly dependent on factors we don’t directly control, like the uptake of connected TVs (sincethe majority of our viewing is on TVs), the adoption of on-demand entertainment, and data costs. Webelieve these factors will keep improving over time, so that all broadband households will be potentialNetflix customers.\\nSecond, in addition to our 222m paying households,we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region. Account sharing as a percentage ofour paying membership hasn’t changed much over the years, but, coupled with the first factor, meansit’s harder to grow membership in many markets - an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth.\\nThird, competition for viewing with linear TV as wellas YouTube, Amazon, and Hulu has been robust forthe last 15 years. However, over the last three years, as traditional entertainment companies realizedstreaming is the future, many new streaming services have also launched. While our US televisionviewing share, for example, has been steady to up according to Nielsen, we want to grow that sharefaster. Higher view share is an indicator of higher satisfaction, which supports higher retention andrevenue.\\nSource: Nielsen. Note: Hulu and YouTube figures include their virtual MVPD services.\\nFourth, macro factors, including sluggish economicgrowth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events suchas Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID are likely having an impact aswell.\\n2\\nOur plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects ofNetflix - in particular the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our membersvalue most. On the content side, we’re doubling down on story development and creative excellence,which we see reflected in big Q1’22 TV hits likeBridgerton(627 million hours viewed for season 2*, our1\\nbiggest English language series in our history) andInventing Anna(512m hours viewed) - both from ourextremely successful partnership with Shonda Rhimes - and films likeTinder Swindler(166m hoursviewed, our biggest documentary film ever released) andThe Adam Project(233m hours viewed), whichcome on the back of our Q4 hitsRed NoticeandDon’tLook Up. On the product side, we recentlylaunched “double thumbs up” so members can better express what they truly love versus simply like -enabling us to continue to improve our personalized recommendations and overall experience.\\nThis focus on continuous improvement has served us well over the past 25 years - from our big battlewith Blockbuster nearly 20 years ago through the launch and growth of streaming, to the switch fromlicensed second run TV series and films to original programming, and our development from a domesticbusiness with primarily English language content to a global entertainment service. It’s why we are nowthe largest subscription streaming service in the world on all key metrics: paid memberships,engagement, revenue and profit.\\nAnother focus is how best to monetize sharing - the 100M+ households using another household’saccount. This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying ourservice. Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. Andwe\\'ve always tried to make sharingwithina member’shousehold easy, with features like profiles andmultiple streams. While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and howNetflix can be shared with other households. So early last year we started testing different approaches tomonetize sharing and, in March, introduced two newpaid sharing features, where current membershave the choice to pay for additional households, in three markets in Latin America. There’s a broadrange of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing. So while wewon’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity. As wework to monetize sharing, growth in ARM, revenue and viewing will become more important indicatorsof our success than membership growth.\\nOver the longer term, much of our growth will come from outside the US. Traditionally, USentertainment companies have viewed “international” as an export market for US content. But we sawlong ago that great stories can be made anywhere and loved everywhere - dramatically broadening thepool of creators with whom we can work, increasing the variety of our programming and better servinglocal tastes. To support this, we’ve been building out capabilities like creative development,personalization, and language presentation/localization. Netflix is now producing films and TV in morethan 50 countries with a high degree of integration in the local entertainment ecosystem resulting in thecreation of blockbusters from every region. In fact, three out of our six most popular TV seasons of alltime are non-English language titles:Squid Game,La Casa de PapelPart 4 andAll Of Us Are Dead, which\\n1Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with anasterisk), data is from launch date through April 17, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based onhours viewed atNetflix Top 10.\\n3\\nlaunched in Q1’22 and has accumulated 561m hours viewed in its first four weeks. So an important focusis working to extend our lead in this area.\\nOur goal is to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating income even faster (as we expandmargins) and generate growing positive free cash flow (FCF). During this period of slower revenuegrowth, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange (F/X), we aim to protect our profitability andmanage to a minimum operating margin roughly in line with current levels (i.e., this year’s 19-20%guidance). Once we’ve re-accelerated revenue growth, we’re committed to steadily growing ouroperating margin.\\nQ1 R esults and Q2 F orecast\\nOur 10% revenue growth in Q1’22 was driven by an 8% year over year increase in average streaming paidmemberships and 2% year over year growth in ARM.Excluding a F/X impact of -$280 million, year over2\\nyear revenue and ARM growth were +14% and +6%, respectively. Operating income of $2.0 billion wasabove our beginning of quarter forecast of $1.8 billion due to lower than projected content expense. EPSof $3.53 vs. $3.75 a year ago included a $162 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurementon our Euro denominated debt.\\nPaid net additions were -0.2m compared against our guidance forecast of 2.5m and 4.0m in the samequarter a year ago. The suspension of our service in Russia and winding-down of all Russian paidmemberships resulted in a -0.7m impact on paid net adds; excluding this impact, paid net additionstotaled +0.5m. The main challenge for membership growth is continued soft acquisition across allregions. Retention was also slightly lower relative to our guidance forecast, although it remains at a veryhealthy level (we believe among the best in the industry). Recent price changes are largely trackingin-line with our expectations and remain significantly revenue positive.\\nIn EMEA (-0.3M paid net adds, or +0.4m excluding the Russia impact), we saw a slowdown in ourbusiness in Central and Eastern Europe in March, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Paid netadditions in LATAM totaled -0.4M; similar to recent quarters, we believe a combination of forcesincluding macroeconomic weakness and our price changes (F/X neutral ARM grew 20% year over year)were a drag on our membership growth. UCAN paid net adds of -0.6M was largely the result of our pricechange which is tracking in-line with our expectations and is significantly revenue positive. We’re makinggood progress in APAC where we are seeing nice growth in a variety of markets including Japan, India,Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.For Q2’22, we forecast paid net additions of -2.0m vs. +1.5m in the year ago quarter. Our forecastassumes our current trends persist (such as slow acquisition and the near term impact of price changes)plus typical seasonality (Q2 paid net adds are usually less than Q1 paid net adds). We project revenue togrow approximately 10% year over year in Q2, assuming roughly a mid-to-high single digit year over year\\n2ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n4\\nincrease in ARM on a F/X neutral basis. We still target a 19%-20% operating margin for the full year 2022,assuming no material swings in F/X rates from when we set this goal in January of 2022.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $923 million vs. $777 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flowamounted to $802 million vs.$692 million. We continue to expect to be free cash3\\nflow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond.\\nDuring the quarter, we completed two acquisitions (leading visual effects companyScanlineand gamingstudioBoss Fight Entertainment), which had a -$125million impact on cash. We also announced ourpurchase of Helsinki-based gaming companyNext Games.We’ve completed the tender offer and expectto complete the transaction in the second half of 2022.\\nWe finished Q1 with gross debt of $14.6 billion after repaying $700 million of our senior notes. We’renow within the top end of our gross debt target range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $6.0 billion, netdebt was $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter, equating to a 1.3x LTM leverage ratio. Given those uses4\\nof cash and our minimum cash target, we didn’t engage in share repurchase activity during the quarter.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nWe recently published our2021 ESG Report(March 30,2022). We’ve made good progress on ourclimatecommitmentsannounced last year - reducing or avoidingmore than 14,000 metric tons of emissions in2021. This enabled us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 footprint by more than 10% from what it otherwisewould have been and puts us on track to cut 45% of these emissions by 2030.\\nWe continue to develop our inclusion lens. In 2021, women made up 51.7% of our global workforce, up5\\nfrom 48.7% in 2020. Half of our US workforce (50.5%) is made up of people from one or more historicallyexcluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds, including Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern,Native American, and Pacific Islander. That’s upfrom 46.8% in the previous year. The number of US6\\nBlack employees increased from 8.6% to 10.7% and Black leadership increased from 10.9% to 13.3%. Thenumber of US Hispanic or Latino employees increased from 7.9% to 8.6%, and US Hispanic or Latinoleadership grew slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%.\\nAs noted in our last investor letter and our2022preliminary proxy, the board has decided to recommendto shareholders that Netflix evolve to a more standard large cap company governance structure.

In Q1, there were no substantial variations from our January guidance forecast.\\n \\n \\nDue to content (primarily \\n\\u200b\\nHouse of Cards \\n\\u200b\\nseason 5) moving from Q1 to Q2, we had higher operating\\n \\nmargins in Q1 (as forecasted) at 9.7% than our plan for the year (about 7%).  We forecast operating\\n \\nmargin at 4.4% in Q2, placing us on track to reach our 7% target for the full year.\\n \\n \\nThe other effect of the content moves is lower net adds in Q1 compared to prior year (as expected) and\\n \\nheavier net adds in Q2 compared to prior year (about double).  We have come to see these quarterly\\n \\nvariances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV. For the first half of\\n \\nthis year, for example, we expect to have 8.15 million net adds, compared to 8.42 million net adds in the\\n \\nfirst half last year.\\n \\n \\nInternational net additions decreased 22% year over year, as we lapped our January 2016 launch of over\\n \\n130 countries, and the accompanying early surge demand, in Q1 2016. Revenue for the international\\n \\nsegment grew 62% year over year, excluding a -$12 million impact from currency, while ASP rose 12%\\n \\nyear over year on a F/X neutral basis. Q1 was the first quarter of consolidated profit for our international\\n \\nsegment as profit growth in our more mature territories offset investments in newer markets.  Our\\n \\nforward guidance shows that we intend to continue to invest internationally, projecting a small loss for\\n \\nQ2.\\n \\nWe have high satisfaction and are rapidly growing in Latin America, Europe, and North America. We are\\n \\nmaking good strides in improving our content offering to match local tastes in Asia, Middle East, and\\n \\nAfrica, but have much progress to make, like in Latin America a few years ago.\\n \\n \\nOur year-over-year streaming revenue growth is benefiting from a price change in mid 2016, and will\\n \\nmoderate over the course of the year to track membership growth more closely. We are seeing a small\\n \\nbut steady migration to our 4-stream, 4K-UHD-HDR video quality tier, which is our high end plan. That\\n \\nwill keep revenue growth slightly above membership growth, holding F/X constant.\\n \\n \\nFor the last several years we’ve had flat operating margins due to established markets funding\\n \\ninternational expansion with every spare dollar we had. Because of that, the major indicators of our\\n \\nprogress were member and revenue growth and US contribution margins. Starting this year, we can be\\n \\nprimarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics. The\\n \\nsummary table above has been reorganized to reflect that, while maintaining comparability to the past.\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nWith a growing member base spread across the world, we seek to please diverse tastes with a wide\\n \\nbreadth of content. The key releases this past quarter highlight this range of programming: \\n\\u200b\\nA Series of\\n \\nUnfortunate Events\\n\\u200b\\n, a dark comedy for the entire family, \\n\\u200b\\nSanta Clarita Diet\\n\\u200b\\n, a “zom-com” starring Drew\\n \\nBarrymore and \\n\\u200b\\nUltimate Beastmaster\\n\\u200b\\n, our first competition show which pits athletes from around the\\n \\nglobe against a fearsome 600-foot obstacle course.\\n \\n2\\n \\nIn addition to these titles, on March 17, we debuted \\n\\u200b\\nMarvel’s Iron Fist\\n\\u200b\\n, which has quickly become\\n \\nanother highly viewed Marvel series, and sets the stage for \\n\\u200b\\nThe Defenders\\n\\u200b\\n, which brings together all the\\n \\ncharacters from the Marvel series later this year. A week later, we launched \\n\\u200b\\nIngobernable\\n\\u200b\\n, our second\\n \\nMexican series, starring Kate del Castillo, which has been very popular in Mexico. On the last day of Q1,\\n \\nwe unveiled \\n\\u200b\\n13 Reasons Why\\n\\u200b\\n. Below is global search volume for several of our big launches over the last\\n \\nyear.\\n \\n \\n \\nWe have also stepped up our investment in stand up comedy which we believe can help grow our\\n \\nbusiness, like our original series. Early results are promising; the triumphant return of a comedy legend\\n \\nin \\n\\u200b\\nDave Chappelle: Collection 1\\n\\u200b\\n was our most viewed comedy special ever. We are also finding this to be\\n \\ntrue in international markets as well, with comedian Gad Elmaleh’s \\n\\u200b\\nGad Gone Wild\\n\\u200b\\n, a breakout hit in\\n \\nFrance last quarter.\\n \\nJust ahead of the release of our third film from Adam Sandler, \\n\\u200b\\nSandy Wexler\\n\\u200b\\n, we announced the renewal\\n \\nof our deal with Sandler to premiere an additional four films exclusively on Netflix around the world. We\\n \\ncontinue to be excited by our Sandler relationship and our members continue to be thrilled with his\\n \\nfilms. Since the launch of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Ridiculous 6\\n\\u200b\\n, Netflix members have spent more than half a billion hours\\n \\nenjoying the films of Adam Sandler.\\n \\n \\nWe recently hired \\n\\u200b\\nScott Stuber\\n\\u200b\\n to lead our original films initiative. Our goal remains the same: to offer a\\n \\nvariety of new movies that will attract and delight members at better economics relative to licensing\\n \\nmovies under traditional windowing. Some of our early movies have been successful by this measure,\\n \\nsuch as the Sandler movies and \\n\\u200b\\nSiege of Jadotville\\n\\u200b\\n. Others, such as \\n\\u200b\\nCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon:\\n \\nSword of Destiny\\n\\u200b\\n, have not.  Scott’s mandate is to increase both the portfolio and the percentage of\\n \\nfilms that delight many of our members relative to the film’s cost.\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nSince our members are funding these films, they should be the first to see them. But we are also open to\\n \\nsupporting the large theater chains, such as AMC and Regal in the US, if they want to offer our films,\\n \\nsuch as our upcoming Will Smith film \\n\\u200b\\nBright\\n\\u200b\\n, in theatres simultaneous to Netflix. Let consumers choose.\\n \\n \\nProduct\\n \\nAs always, our product team has dozens of tests running in the endless quest for even higher member\\n \\nsatisfaction. One test that won conclusively last year and has now been rolled out to all members is our\\n \\nnew “thumbs-up thumbs-down” feedback model, replacing the 5-star model we have had from our DVD\\n \\ndays. The amount of usage we get with this new approach is over twice as many ratings.  With this\\n \\nadditional personal input, we’ll be able to improve personalization, making your front screen on Netflix\\n \\neven more relevant.\\n \\n \\nA multi-year effort ahead is to have video replace still images in our user experience in ways that please\\n \\nour members and help them choose what to watch. Video for choosing video is an obvious direction, but\\n \\ndoing it well through our interface takes judgment, creativity, and testing.\\n \\nIn April, we will add Thai and later in the quarter, Romanian and Hebrew, to the 24 languages we\\n \\ncurrently support.\\n \\n \\nMarketing\\n \\nAs our slate of content expands, we’ll spend over $1 billion in 2017 marketing our content to drive\\n \\nmember acquisition. As part of this, we are investing more in programmatic advertising with the aim of\\n \\nimproving our ability to do individualized marketing at scale and to deliver the right ad to the right\\n \\nperson at the right time. Buttressing this activity is the substantial earned media coverage around the\\n \\nNetflix brand, technology and content we generate globally through events and activities aimed at\\n \\njournalists and social media influencers. We also market our content extensively to members through\\n \\nour service and with our partners. For instance, we participated in Comcast’s Watchathon in April,\\n \\nproviding X1 subscribers unlimited access to Netflix for a week.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nOur investors often ask us about ecosystem change, such as the advent in the US of virtual MVPDs (like\\n \\nSling, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, YouTube TV and Hulu’s forthcoming service). We believe VMVPDs\\n \\nwill likely be more directly competitive to existing MVPD services since they offer a subset of the same\\n \\nchannels at $30-$60 per month, and may appeal to a segment of the population that doesn’t subscribe\\n \\nto a pay TV bundle. But we don’t think it will have much of an impact on us as Netflix is largely\\n \\ncomplementary to pay TV packages. Our focus also is on on-demand, commercial free viewing rather\\n \\nthan live, ad-supported programming.\\n \\n \\nAdditionally, investors ask us about Amazon’s move into NFL football.  That is not a strategy that we\\n \\nthink is smart for us since we believe we can earn more viewing and satisfaction from spending that\\n \\nmoney on movies and TV shows.\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nFree cash flow in Q1’17 was -$423 million vs. -$261 million in the year ago quarter and an improvement\\n \\nfrom -$639 million in Q4’16. The growth in our original content means we continue to plan to have\\n \\naround $2B in negative FCF this year.\\n \\n \\nWe have a large market opportunity ahead of us and we’re optimizing long-term FCF by growing our\\n \\noriginal content aggressively. Negative near-term FCF is the result of the big increases in our original\\n \\ncontent, combined with small but growing operating margins. Since we want our operating margins to\\n \\ngrow slowly so we can spend enough to quickly grow revenue and original content, we anticipate\\n \\nnegative FCF to accompany our rapid growth for many years. Our operating margins are our key\\n \\nindicator of improving global profitability; they are already growing and we plan to keep them growing\\n \\nfor many years ahead. Eventually, at a much larger revenue base, original content and revenue growth\\n \\nwill be slower, and we anticipate substantial positive FCF, like our media peers.\\n \\nOur debt to total cap ratio, at under 10%, is quite conservative compared to most of our media peers at\\n \\n30-70%, and conservative compared to efficient capital structure theory. Thus we will continue to add\\n \\nlong-term debt as needed to finance our expansion of original content, including in Q2’17.\\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2016\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nApril 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary, 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2015\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2015\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2015\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSummary\\n \\nWe remain incredibly excited about the opportunity in front of us to build a truly global and durable\\n \\ninternet TV business.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity\\n \\nmetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to\\n \\nrepay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in\\n \\noperations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nshould be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,\\n \\ndiluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures\\n \\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nare contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding the company’s business opportunity, balancing\\n \\ncontribution profit and investment in the service, localization efforts, operating margins, plans to invest\\n \\nin growth; product initiatives; marketing spend; impacts on our business from competition; localization\\n \\nefforts; content strategy, including local content, original and licensed content investments; use of\\n \\ncapital; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue;\\n \\ncontribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and\\n \\ninternational operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income,\\n \\nearnings per share and free cash flow.

EPS of $3.75 vs. $1.57 a year agoincluded a $253m non-cash unrealized gain from F/Xremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\nThe extraordinary events of Covid-19 led to unprecedentedmembership growth in 2020, as it pulledforward growth from 2021, and delayed production acrossevery region. In turn, we ended 2020 with abigger membership and revenue base than we would otherwisehave had, contributing to record Q1’21revenues. And since we were still ramping productionlevels late last year, we had lower content spendin\\n1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesalestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nQ1’21 - content amortization only grew 9.5% year over year in Q1’21 vs. 17% in FY20. The result was a 10percentage point year over year jump in our operatingmargin to 27% in Q1, which is an all-time high.\\nAs we discussed in past letters, these dynamics arealso contributing to a lighter content slate in thefirsthalf of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth. In Q1, paid net additions of 4m werebelow our 6m guidance (and the 16m net additions inthe year ago quarter) primarily due to acquisition,as retention in Q1 was in line with our expectations.We don’t believe competitive intensity materiallychanged in the quarter or was a material factor inthe variance as the over-forecast was across allof ourregions. We also saw similar percentage year-over-yeardeclines in paid net adds in all regions (see ourRegional Breakdown table below), whereas the levelof competitive intensity varies by country.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report.That means in some quarters our results will be highrelative to our guidance forecast and, in others,itwill be low, as can be seen in the chart below. Asour membership base continues to grow, there willnaturally be more volatility in our absolute paidnet additions performance vs. forecast.\\nWith similar pull forward and delayed slate dynamicsplus our typical seasonality expected to impactQ2’21, we project paid net additions of 1m (vs. 10min the prior year quarter) with our UCAN and LATAMregions expected to be roughly flattish in memberships(+/- a couple hundred thousand paid net adds).We anticipate paid membership growth will re-acceleratein the second half of 2021 as we ramp into avery strong back half slate with the return of bighits likeSex Education,The Witcher,La Casa dePapel(akaMoney Heist), andYou, as well as an excitingarray of original films including the finale toTheKissingBoothtrilogy and large scale, star-driven featureslikeRed Notice(starring Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnsonand Ryan Reynolds) andDon’t Look Up(with an all-starcast including Leonardo DiCaprio, JenniferLawrence, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and MerylStreep). We’ll also have our mostcomprehensive offering to date of local language titlesincludingToo Hot to Handlefor Brazil and Mexico,\\n2\\na special based on our Korean hit franchiseKingdom, the action-thrillerDhamaka(India), as well as newseasons ofSintonia(Brazil), andControl Z(Mexico).\\nAs always, we’re focusing on the fundamentals of ourbusiness, which remain healthy. In addition to ourrecord financial results, engagement per member householdgrew solidly year over year in Q1’21. We’realso seeing how much members value Netflix with Q1’21churn below Q1‘20 levels, demonstrating thatas we improve the service, we can charge a bit more.Our FY21 operating margin target of 20% vs. 18%last year remains unchanged. We are optimistic aboutthe future and believe we are still in the earlydaysof the adoption of internet entertainment, which shouldprovide us with many years of growth ahead.\\nContent\\nAs seen in the weekly growth chart above, in earlyQ1, with the benefit ofBridgerton,LupinandCobraKai, we were following a growth trajectory similarto recent years. As we’ve noted previously, theproduction delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will leadto a 2021 slate that is more heavily second halfweighted with a large number of returning franchises.And while the roll out of vaccines is very unevenacross the world, we are back up and producing safelyin every major market, with the exception ofBrazil and India. Assuming this continues, we’ll spendover $17 billion in cash on content this year andwe’ll continue to deliver an amazing range of titlesfor our members with more originals this year thanlast.\\nThere are several facets to our content strategy.First and foremost, we want to deliver a wide varietyofbest-in-class stories that our members love and watchin big numbers. Examples of this breadth in Q1include season one ofFirefly Lane(49m chose to watchthis title in its first 28 days), season 3 ofCobraKai(45m),Fate: The Winx Saga(57m), andGinny &Georgia(52m). Our top movies in Q1 includeI CareALot(56m),YES DAY(62m),Outside the Wire(66m) andthe last installment ofTo All the Boys I’ve Loved\\n3\\nBeforetrilogy (51m). We program across many genres because tastes are very diverse. Even for oneperson, what they desire will vary widely dependingon their mood or who they are watching with.\\nAnother goal is to create great, locally authenticstories in countries all around the world. It’s whyourpriority for local language titles is to have a bigimpact in the home territory so we don’t sacrificelocalimpact for “travelability.” But we’re increasinglyseeing that these local titles find significant audiencesaround the world, which supports our thesis that greatstories are universal: they can come fromanywhere and be loved everywhere. Notable standoutsthis quarter includeBelow Zerofrom Spain (47mchose to watch in its first four weeks),Space Sweepersfrom Korea (26m),Squared Lovefrom Poland(31m) andWho Killed Sara?from Mexico (an estimated55m), which is also our most popularnon-English title ever in the US in its first 28 days(with season 2 launching on May 19).\\nWe want our titles to be talked about by audiencesacross the globe. Because of our broad distributionand highly engaged members, our titles not only generatehigh levels of viewing but also can pierce thecultural zeitgeist and transcend the film and TV industry.There were two recent standout examples ofthis:Lupin, our French language series about a daringgentleman burglar played by Omar Sy, was notonly our most popular new title this quarter on Netflix(76m member households chose to watch in thefirst 28 days), but it alsopropelled book salesofthe novel in France;Lupin: Part 2will debut laterinQ2’21. Similarly, driven by the late December launchof season one ofBridgerton, Julia Quinn’s bookshitThe New York Timesbestseller list for the first timein 18 years.\\nNetflix led all studios for recent award nominationsincluding the Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG Awards,BAFTA and the NAACP Image Awards, among others. Headinginto the Academy Awards this weekend,we have 36 nominations across 17 films including twonominees in each of the Best Picture (Mank,TheTrial of the Chicago 7), Best Documentary Feature(Crip Camp,My Octopus Teacher), and Best AnimatedFeature (Over the Moon,A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon)categories.Mankled all films with 10nominations.\\nProduct\\nWe are constantly working to make it easier for membersto access and enjoy something they will love,regardless of their location or mood. In Q1, we launchedan opt-inDownloads for Youfeature for Android(with iOS coming soon) that automatically downloadsrecommended shows and movies onto amember\\'s mobile device, ensuring that they alwayshave something to watch irrespective ofconnectivity. Knowing that bandwidth and storage canbe precious, this feature tries to choose only themost relevant content to download.\\nThis quarter we also launchedFast Laughs, a mobilefeed of short comedy clips from Netflix favorites-it\\'s initially available in several countries includingthe US on iOS and will be on Android soon. Fortelevision viewers, this month we unveiled an updatedand improved experience for Kids Profile thatmore vividly and easilyconnects childrenwith theirfavorite titles and characters.\\n4\\nCompe tition\\nWe compete with many activities for consumers’ entertainmenttime, ranging from watching linear TV,video gaming, and viewing user generated content,just to name a few. Against this backdrop, theentertainment market is huge, giving us plenty ofroom to grow, if we can continue to improve ourservice. We believe we are less than 10% of TV screentime in the US and even smaller in other regionsand when including mobile devices.\\nMore and more new streaming services are launching,reinforcing our vision that linear TV will slowlygive way to streaming entertainment. Despite our 10+year head start, we are continually seekingoperational and creative excellence; we’re workingas hard as ever to continually improve our servicesothat we are the best entertainment option availablewith best in class stories, an ever-improving productexperience and authentic local titles that our memberslove. Our ability to evolve from a DVD-by-mail toan internet entertainment business, from a US-onlyto a global service, and from a licensor of secondwindow content to a producer of original content acrossso many different categories fuels ourconfidence and optimism for our next decade of challenges,growth and innovation.\\nWhen comparing services, subscriber figures alonetell only part of the story (given bundles, discountsand other promotions) so it’s important to also focuson engagement and revenue as key indicators ofsuccess; they drive the flywheel of investment ineven more amazing stories for our members and futuregrowth. It’s our job to please our members so muchon Monday, that on Tuesday, they start with us, andthen they stick with us as their first choice forentertainment.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was$777 million vs. $260 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)for the quarter was$692 million vs. $162 million in Q1‘20. We are ontrack2\\nfor full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximatelybreak even. As we discussed last quarter, we believewe are very close to being sustainably FCF positiveand that we no longer have a need to raise externalfinancing to fund our day-to-day operations.\\nDuring the quarter, we repaid our 5.375% February1, 2021 bond ($500 million principal) out of balancesheet cash, reducing our total gross debt balanceto $15.7 billion as of March 31, 2021. We intend tomaintain $10-$15 billion of gross debt. Our boardhas approved a program to repurchase up to $5 billionof our common stock beginning in 2021 with no fixedexpiration date. We expect our buyback programwill begin this quarter.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nWe’ve added a new section to our investor relationssite that collates all of ourESG informationforourinvestors, including our recently published2020 ESGReport(filed March 30, 2021).

These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT.\\n \\n1\\n \\n \\noutside the UCAN region. Our EMEA region accounted for 41% of our full year paid net adds, while APAC\\n \\nwas the second largest contributor to paid net additions with 9.3m (up 65% year over year).\\n \\n \\n \\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report\\n \\nand we strive for accuracy. For Q1’21, we expect paid net adds of 6.0m vs. last Q1’s 15.8m, which\\n \\nincluded the impact from the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. Since the start of 2018, our paid memberships\\n \\nhave risen from 111m to 204m and our average revenue per membership has grown from $9.88 to\\n \\n$11.02, despite significant F/X headwinds. This approach has allowed us to organically increase revenue\\n \\nby $4-$5 billion annually over the past several years.\\n \\n \\nWe’ve made good progress growing our profitability with FY20 operating margin of 18% rising five\\n \\npercentage points over prior year. For FY21, we’re now targeting a 20% operating margin, up two\\n \\npercentage points from 2020 and higher than our previous 19% forecast, due to a more favorable\\n \\nrevenue outlook. As we said last quarter, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year\\n \\nat an average rate of three percentage points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate some\\n \\nlumpiness. Some years we’ll be a little over (like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021), but we\\n \\nare trying to keep on an average three percentage points per year long-term trajectory.\\n \\nContent\\n \\nThe big growth in streaming entertainment has led legacy competitors like Disney, WarnerMedia and\\n \\nDiscovery to compete with us in new ways, which we’ve been expecting for many years. This is, in part,\\n \\nwhy we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a\\n \\nwide range of genres and nations. Our fourth quarter slate highlights the breadth and diversity of our\\n \\nentertainment offering.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nIn scripted English language television, season four of the critically acclaimed \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n was the biggest\\n \\nseason so far and drove new watchers of prior seasons. In its first 28 days, more member households\\n \\nchose to watch season four of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown \\n\\u200b\\nthan each of the prior seasons, helping to grow the number of\\n \\nmember households that have chosen to watch this series to over 100m since its initial launch. In late\\n \\nDecember, we released our first original series from Shonda Rhimes, \\n\\u200b\\nBridgerton.\\n\\u200b\\n This title has proven\\n \\nimmensely popular and we’ll have some exciting news about \\n\\u200b\\nBridgerton\\n\\u200b\\n later this week.\\n \\n \\nOur largest original film of the quarter was \\n\\u200b\\nThe Midnight Sky\\n\\u200b\\n, starring and directed by George Clooney;\\n \\nwe estimate 72m member households will choose to watch this title in its first four weeks. In its first 28\\n \\ndays, 43m member households chose to watch our animated feature film \\n\\u200b\\nOver the Moon\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by\\n \\nlegendary creator Glen Keane) with high levels of rewatching. \\n\\u200b\\nWe Can Be Heroes\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by Robert\\n \\nRodriguez) was another successful family film with a projected 53m member households choosing this\\n \\ntitle in its first four weeks.\\n \\n \\nOur holiday movie slate also resonated with our members; in the first four weeks, 68m and 61m\\n \\nmember households chose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nHolidate\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Emma Roberts) and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Christmas Chronicles:\\n \\nPart Two \\n\\u200b\\n(starring Kurt Russell), respectively. Our first Portuguese language holiday film from Brazil, \\n\\u200b\\nJust\\n \\nAnother Christmas\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Leandro Hassum)\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n\\u200b\\n was also a big hit with 26m member households globally\\n \\nchoosing to watch in the first 28 days of release.\\n \\n \\nWe continue to ramp up our local original content slate. Our top local titles this quarter include\\n \\nBarbarians \\n\\u200b\\n(a historical action series from Germany that 37m member households globally chose to\\n \\nwatch in the first four weeks), \\n\\u200b\\nSweet Home\\n\\u200b\\n, our Korean language horror show (22m member\\n \\nhouseholds), \\n\\u200b\\nSelena: The Series\\n\\u200b\\n, which particularly resonated with members throughout Mexico and the\\n \\nUS (25m member households globally), and \\n\\u200b\\nAlice in Borderland\\n\\u200b\\n, a sci-fi thriller from Japan (18m member\\n \\nhouseholds). While designed to be very impactful in the home country, we see many cases of our local\\n \\noriginals traveling more broadly. For example, \\n\\u200b\\nLupin\\n\\u200b\\n, an adrenalin-filled French language heist series\\n \\nreleased in early January, has hit #2 in our US Top 10 list and ranked #1 in dozens of other countries\\n \\nincluding Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Vietnam, the Philippines and many more. We\\n \\nproject 70m member households will choose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nLupin\\n\\u200b\\n in its first 28 days of release.\\n \\nIn addition to titles with big viewership, we also aspire to have hits that become part of the cultural\\n \\nzeitgeist. In 2020 alone, we had \\n\\u200b\\nTiger King\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nBridgerton\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Queen’s Gambit\\n\\u200b\\n. Not only did 62m\\n \\nmember households choose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nThe Queen’s Gambit\\n\\u200b\\n in its first 28 days (making this show our\\n \\nbiggest limited series in Netflix history), but it ignited\\n\\u200b\\n sales of chess sets\\n\\u200b\\n and inspired the next generation\\n \\nof chess prodigies. In fact, Netflix series accounted for nine out of the 10 most searched shows globally\\n \\nin 2020, while our films represented two of the top 10.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nGoogle Year in Search, 2020 (Global)\\n \\n \\nSource: Google. Note: \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai\\n\\u200b\\n seasons 1 & 2 originally debuted on YouTube Red. Season 3 is a Netflix original.\\n \\nOur productions are back up and running in most regions - we have learned that flexibility and\\n \\nadaptability are paramount in this fast-changing environment.

These enhancements include allowing members to filter out content at the title level or by\\n \\nmaturity rating, creating a profile lock PIN and customizing autoplay settings for any profile. We also\\n \\nextended parental control support to downloads to give parents peace of mind regardless of how Netflix\\n \\nis used. And we provided parents with more transparency into the themes, characters and content that\\n \\ntheir kids love with the Kids Activity Report, a weekly message designed to keep parents informed about\\n \\nthe content their children are watching.\\n \\nAs we bring our members more great programming, we’re always listening and working to make it\\n \\neasier for them to find the right show and film to watch. That’s why last year we debuted our Top 10\\n \\nlists around the world, and in October we introduced the New & Popular tab in our television user\\n \\ninterface, which includes a new Worth the Wait section, highlighting titles as far as a year away that you\\n \\ncan remind yourself about. As another exciting step in this effort, we’ve been testing a new feature that\\n \\n4\\n \\n \\ngives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse. The\\n \\nresponse has been positive and we plan to roll it out globally in the first half of 2021.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nIt’s a great time to be a consumer of entertainment. There are a wealth of options ranging from linear\\n \\nTV to video gaming to user generated content on YouTube and TikTok. We continue to work hard to\\n \\ngrow our small share of screen time against these major competitors.\\n \\n \\nDiscovery\\n\\u200b\\n recently launched its streaming service. Disney+ is \\n\\u200b\\nexpanding\\n\\u200b\\n in new countries and with more\\n \\ncontent. ViacomCBS will be unveiling its plans for Paramount+ in 2021. Combined with the launch of\\n \\nAppleTV+, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming services, this signifies that\\n \\nthese companies all recognize the future is streaming entertainment, a vision we have been working\\n \\ntowards since inception.\\n \\n \\nOur strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members,\\n \\nwe can be their first choice for streaming entertainment. This past year is a testament to this approach.\\n \\nDisney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid\\n \\nmembership growth in our history.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$138 million vs. -$1.5 billion in the prior year\\n \\nperiod. Free cash flow\\n (FCF) for the quarter was -$284 million vs. -$1.7 billion in Q4‘19, bringing full year\\n \\n2\\n2020 free cash flow to +$1.9 billion vs. -$3.3 billion in 2019.\\n \\nWe believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive. For the full year 2021, we currently\\n \\nanticipate free cash flow will be around break even (vs. our prior expectation for -$1 billion to break\\n \\neven). Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750m undrawn credit facility, \\n\\u200b\\nwe believe\\n \\nwe\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nno longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations.\\n\\u200b\\n Our 5.375%\\n \\nFebruary 1, 2021 bonds mature in Q1.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it\\n \\nmeasures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt\\n \\nobligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations,\\n \\nincluding investments in global streaming content. However, this non-GAAP measure should be\\n \\nconsidered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted\\n \\nearnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in\\n \\naccordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are\\n \\ncontained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding investment in our service; average revenue per\\n \\nmembership; future content offerings and the number and timing of such offerings; viewing metrics for\\n \\ncertain titles; product enhancements and offerings; future capital and external financing needs; debt\\n \\nrepayment; global streaming paid members, paid net additions and membership growth; consolidated\\n \\nrevenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and\\n \\nfree cash flow.

Our streaming membership grew more\\n \\nthan expected, from 99m to 104m, due to our amazing content. We also crossed the symbolic\\n \\nmilestones of 100m members and more international than domestic members. It was a good quarter.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n \\n \\nQ2 Results and Q3 Forecast\\n \\nOur quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q2,\\n \\nwe underestimated the popularity of our strong slate of content which led to higher-than-expected\\n \\nacquisition across all major territories. As a result, global net adds totaled a Q2-record 5.2 million (vs.\\n \\nforecast of 3.2m) and increased 5% sequentially, bucking historical seasonal patterns. For the first six\\n \\nmonths of 2017, net adds are up 21% year-on-year to 10.2m.\\n \\nOur Q3 guidance assumes much of this momentum will continue but we are cognizant of the lessons of\\n \\nprior quarters when we over-forecasted and there was lumpiness in net adds, likely due to demand\\n \\nbeing pulled forward (into Q2 in this case).\\n \\n \\nDomestic net additions of 1.1m represented the highest level of Q2 net adds since the second quarter of\\n \\n2011. For Q3’17, we project that we will add 0.75m US members, compared with 0.37m in Q3’16, which\\n \\nwas impacted by un-grandfathering.\\n \\n \\nOur international segment now accounts for 50.1% of our total membership base. International revenue\\n \\nrose 57% year over year, excluding a -$23 million impact from foreign exchange, while international ASP\\n \\ngrew 10% year over year on a F/X neutral basis. International contribution profit of -$13 million vs. -$69\\n \\nmillion was better than our -$28 million forecast due primarily to higher-than-forecasted paid members.\\n \\n \\nWe’re forecasting Q3’17 international net adds of 3.65 million. We are making good progress with our\\n \\ninternational expansion as improving profitability in our earlier international markets helps fund\\n \\nsignificant investment in our newer territories. As a result, we expect\\n\\u200b\\n positive international\\n \\ncontribution profit for the full year 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, at current F/X exchange rates. This would mark the first ever\\n \\nannual contribution profit from our international segment.\\n \\nFor Q2, global streaming revenue was within 1% of our projection.  As expected, operating margin\\n \\ndipped 516 basis points sequentially due to the timing of content releases, and came in at $128m on\\n \\nforecast of $120m. Through the first half of 2017, our operating margin was 7.1%, putting us on track for\\n \\nour full year target of 7%, which we plan on growing in 2018 and beyond. Q2 EPS was on target at $0.15,\\n \\nas a greater than expected tax benefit offset a -$64 million non-cash unrealized loss from our euro bond\\n \\n(which was recognized in our P&L in interest and other income/expense).\\n \\nContent\\n \\nLast week, the Television Academy nominated 27 Netflix original programs with 91 Emmy nominations,\\n \\nnearly double last year’s tally. With five of the 14 total nominated best series contenders (\\n\\u200b\\nStranger\\n \\nThings, The Crown, House of Cards, Master of None \\n\\u200b\\nand\\n\\u200b\\n Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\\n\\u200b\\n), Netflix had the\\n \\nmost nominated series of any network. We are proud that even as we have increased our volume of\\n \\noriginals across several genres, we continue to grow the recognition for the quality of those shows,\\n \\nincluding brand new series like \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n\\u200b\\n The Crown\\n\\u200b\\n, which will have second season\\n \\npremieres in 2017.\\n \\n \\nThe volume and breadth of our releases in Q2 exemplify our commitment to serve the desires of our\\n \\ndiverse and growing audience. We premiered 14 new seasons of global Netflix original series, 13 original\\n \\n2\\n \\n \\ncomedy specials, 6 original documentaries, 2 original documentary series, 9 original feature films and 7\\n \\nseasons of original series for kids.  You can track the dates of all of our upcoming launches \\n\\u200b\\nhere\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\nWe strive to be bold in our programming choices \\n\\u200b\\nand\\n\\u200b\\n financially disciplined, so we can keep being bold.\\n \\nEvery show has passionate fans and committed talent striving for excellence. Sometimes those shows\\n \\ndon’t attract as many viewers as we had hoped, compared to our other content.  As much as we dislike\\n \\nending a series early, it consoles us that it frees up investment for another new show, or two.  We are\\n \\nprogramming to please our members and we keep that as our guiding light. We love it when we support\\n \\na new series that has big impact like \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things, Cable Girls,\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\n13 Reasons Why\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nAs a global TV network, we also showcase local productions to a worldwide audience through our\\n \\ninvestments in non-English language originals. Our Spanish language original \\n\\u200b\\nIngobernable\\n\\u200b\\n, starring Kate\\n \\ndel Castillo, has been viewed by millions of members outside of Mexico. Similarly, in Q2, our first original\\n \\nfrom Spain, \\n\\u200b\\nLas Chicas del Cable\\n\\u200b\\n (\\n\\u200b\\nCable Girls\\n\\u200b\\n), attracted significant viewership in the US and throughout\\n \\nthe entire Spanish-speaking world.\\n \\nWe understand that our approach to films - debuting movies on Netflix first - is counter to Hollywood’s\\n \\ncentury-old windowing \\n\\u200b\\ntradition\\n\\u200b\\n. But just as we changed and reinvented the TV business by putting\\n \\nconsumers first and making access to content more convenient, we believe internet TV can similarly\\n \\nreinvigorate the film business (as distinct from the theatrical business). This year we will release 40\\n \\nfeatures that range from big budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema.  We are proud to\\n \\nproduce films like \\n\\u200b\\nOkja\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nWar Machine\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nBright,\\n\\u200b\\n with big stars, distinctive directors and compelling\\n \\nstories, as well as to introduce new voices like Macon Blair, whose directorial debut \\n\\u200b\\nI Don’t Feel at Home\\n \\nin This World Anymore\\n\\u200b\\n, produced by Netflix, won the Dramatic Jury competition at the Sundance Film\\n \\nFestival this year. Within a few weeks of the win, it premiered on Netflix everywhere, so that it could be\\n \\nenjoyed by fans, exactly when the world was talking about it.\\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nSince the early days of our streaming service, we have partnered with a wide variety of companies to\\n \\nmake it easier for consumers to enjoy Netflix. Our partnerships began with consumer electronic\\n \\ncompanies and video game consoles and evolved to include smartphone makers, mobile operators and\\n \\nMVPDs and ISPs. In Q2, we announced a partnership with Altice/SFR France, whereby Netflix will be sold\\n \\nin a package with high speed Internet and TV services. These arrangements are mutually beneficial - our\\n \\npartners gain more customers and can upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while Netflix\\n \\ngains more reach and awareness with consumers across a market. We are likely to expand this approach\\n \\nas a complement to our direct-to-consumer primary approach.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nThe competition for entertainment time is always intense, but the silver lining is that the market is vast\\n \\nand diverse. YouTube is earning over a billion hours a day of consumers’ time with one type of\\n \\nentertainment, while we are earning over a billion hours a week with our type of entertainment. Linear\\n \\nTV is still huge, piracy still substantial, and there are thousands of firms and approaches around the\\n \\nworld earning some fraction of consumers’ entertainment time. The entertainment market is so broad\\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nthat we’ve grown from zero to over 50m streaming households in the US over the last 10 years, and yet\\n \\nHBO continues to increase its US subscriptions. It seems our growth just expands the market. The largely\\n \\nexclusive nature of each service’s content means that we are not direct substitutes for each other, but\\n \\nrather complements.\\n \\n \\nIn addition to the many SVOD players around the world (Blim, Globoplay, FilmStruck, Hooq, iflix, Stan,\\n \\netc.) the large-cap tech companies, especially Amazon, are investing heavily in original and licensed\\n \\ncontent around the world. They join all the existing TV networks (BBC, AMC, NHK, etc.) of the world, and\\n \\nus, in bidding for great content. Creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment\\n \\nis pouring into content production around the world.\\n \\n \\nWe are all co-pioneers of internet TV and, together, we are replacing linear TV. The shift from linear TV\\n \\nto on-demand viewing is so big and there is so much leisure time, many internet TV services will be\\n \\nsuccessful. The internet may not have been great for the music business due to piracy, but, wow, it is\\n \\nincredible for growing the video entertainment business around the world.\\n \\n \\nCulture\\n \\nWe recently crafted a major update on our \\n\\u200b\\nculture description\\n\\u200b\\n, to reflect our thinking as we have\\n \\nbecome more global. Our culture plays a major role in our continued evolution and success.\\n \\n \\n \\nFree Cashflow and Capital Structure\\n \\nQ2’17 free cash amounted to -$608 million vs. -$254 million in the year ago quarter and -$423 million in\\n \\nQ1’17. We anticipate free cash flow of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. With our content\\n \\nstrategy paying off in strong member, revenue and profit growth, we think it’s wise to continue to\\n \\ninvest. In continued success, we will deploy increased capital in content, particularly in owned originals,\\n \\nand, as we have said before, we expect to be FCF negative for many years. Since our FCF is driven by our\\n \\ncontent investment, particularly in self-produced originals, we wanted to provide some additional\\n \\ncontext on our content accounting at our \\n\\u200b\\ninvestor relations\\n\\u200b\\n website.\\n \\n \\nWe continue to debt finance our capital needs as we believe this reduces our weighted average cost of\\n \\ncapital, resulting in a more efficient capital structure. In May, we completed a 1.3 billion euro bond\\n \\noffering. In addition to a small natural hedge to our growing European revenues, we are pleased to have\\n \\nbroadened our access to capital markets beyond the US high yield market. Our euro bond may add some\\n \\nvolatility to our net income as each quarter we remeasure the liability on our balance sheet based on\\n \\nthe quarter end euro-to-dollar exchange rate. As a reminder, quarter-to-quarter remeasurement\\n \\nchanges in this liability are reflected as a non-cash unrealized gain (loss) below operating income in\\n \\n“interest and other income/expense” in our P&L (-$64 million impact on net income in Q2’17).\\n \\n \\nSummary\\n \\nIt’s been twenty years since Netflix was founded and we still thrive on connecting people with great\\n \\nstories. Someday, we hope to entertain everyone.\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2016\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJuly 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary, 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2015\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2015\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nJuly 17th, 2017 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST\\n \\nOur video interview with Doug Mitchelson of UBS will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm PST today.\\n \\nQuestions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to \\n\\u200b\\ndoug.mitchelson@ubs.com\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIR Contact:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSpencer Wang\\n \\n  Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations\\n \\n  408 809-5360\\n \\n \\n \\nPR Contact:\\n \\n \\nJonathan Friedland\\n \\nChief Communications Officer\\n \\n \\n \\n310 734-2958\\n \\n \\n \\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free\\n \\ncash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity\\n \\nmetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to\\n \\nrepay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in\\n \\noperations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nshould be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,\\n \\ndiluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures\\n \\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nare contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding the acquisition impact of our content slate; growth of\\n \\ninternet video; content strategy, including future launches; future capital raises; impact of Euro bond\\n \\nraise on net income; partnership strategies; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers;\\n \\nrevenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic international operations,\\n \\nas well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free\\n \\ncash flow.

We finished the quarter withover 209m paid memberships, slightly ahead of ourforecast. COVID has created some lumpiness in ourmembership growth (higher growth in 2020, slowergrowth this year), which is working its way through.We continue to focus on improving our service forour members and bringing them the best stories fromaround the world. Our summary results andforecast for Q3 are below.\\nQ2 R esults and Q3 F orecast\\nRevenue growth was driven by an 11% increase in averagepaid streaming memberships and 8% growthin average revenue per membership (ARM). ARM rose4%, excluding a foreign exchange (FX) impact of1\\n+$277m. Operating margin of 25.2% expanded 3 percentagepoints compared with the year ago quarter.EPS of $2.97 vs. $1.59 a year ago included a $63mnon-cash unrealized loss from FX remeasurement onour Euro denominated debt.\\nThe pandemic has created unusual choppiness in ourgrowth and distorts year-over-year comparisons asacquisition and engagement per member household spikedin the early months of COVID. In Q2’21, ourengagement per member household was, as expected,down vs. those unprecedented levels but was stillup 17% compared with a more comparable Q2’19. Similarly,retention continues to be strong and betterthan pre-COVID Q2’19 levels, even as average revenueper membership has grown 8% over this two-year\\n1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesalestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nperiod, demonstrating how much our members value Netflix and that as we improve our service we cancharge a bit more.\\nWe added 1.5m paid memberships in Q2, slightly aheadof our 1.0m guidance forecast. The APAC regionrepresented about two-thirds of our global paid net adds in the quarter. As expected, Q2 paidmemberships in the UCAN region were slightly downsequentially (-0.4m paid net adds). We believe ourlarge membership base in UCAN coupled with a seasonallysmaller quarter for acquisition is the mainreason for this dynamic. This is similar to what weexperienced in Q2’19 when our UCAN paid net addswere -0.1m; since then we’ve added nearly 7.5m paidnet adds in UCAN.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report.For Q3’21, we forecast paid net additions of 3.5mvs. 2.2m in the prior year period. If we achieve ourforecast, we will have added more than 54m paid netadds over the past 24 months or 27m on anannualized basis over that time period, which is consistentwith our pre-COVID annual rate of netadditions. We forecast that ARM will grow roughly5% year over year on a FX neutral basis in Q3’21.\\nWe continue to target a 20% operating margin for thefull year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. After our big globallaunch in January 2016, we committed to steadily growingour operating margin thereafter at an averagerate of three percentage points per year over anyfew-year period. Some years we’ll be a little over(likein 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021).Assuming we achieve our margin target this year,wewill have quintupled our operating margin in the lastfive years and are tracking ahead of this averageannual three percentage point pace.\\n2\\nWith revenue and margin both increasing, our operatingprofit dollars have risen dramatically as well(even as we have been investing heavily), from about$100 million per quarter in 2016 to nearly $2billion per quarter so far in 2021. Our belief isthat as we steadily improve our service to betterpleaseour members, this will lead to continued growth inour membership base, ARM, revenue, operatingmargin and profit dollars.\\nContent\\nWe launched our first original scripted TV seriesin 2012 and we’ve since expanded our originalprogramming effort to many additional categories,from all over the world. Our goal is to be everyone’sfirst choice for entertainment because of the varietyand quality of our titles. And despite theCOVID-related production delays in 2020, we were ableto deliver an exciting portfolio of titles in Q2’21that exemplify this ambition.\\nFor example,Shadow and Bone, a fantasy series basedon the popularGrishaverse book series, proved tobe very popular with our members. Over 55m memberhouseholds chose to watch this show in its first28 days and we’ve renewed it for a second season.Sweet Tooth, based on the beloved DC comic, wasanother hit series with 60m member households choosingthis title in its first four weeks.\\nOur expansion into non-fiction series is going well.This past quarter, standout unscripted titles includeseason two of dating showToo Hot to Handleand socialexperiment reality programThe Circle(anestimated 29m and 14m, respectively, chose to watchin the first 28 days) as well as the true crimedocu-seriesThe Sons of Sam(19m). We’re buildingout some of these unscripted titles with localversions of the same formats. As one example,TooHot to Handle: BrazilandToo Hot to Handle: Latinowill be launching later in July and September, respectively,to serve our LATAM region.\\n3\\nWe’re also quickly growing both our live action and animated original film offering, with severalimpactful titles in Q2. Zack Snyder’sArmy of the Deadwas a blockbuster as 75m member householdschose to watch this action packed zombie spectaclein its first 28 days of release. As an extensiontoArmy of the Dead, a prequel,Army of Thieves, willbe released in Q4’21 along with a spinoff anime serieslater in 2022.Fatherhood, a dramedy starring KevinHart, was another hit, drawing an estimated 74mmember households in its first 28 days. And Q2 alsofeatured our biggest Netflix animated film to datewith 53m member households choosing to watchThe Mitchellsvs. The Machines.\\nLast week, Netflix series and specials received 129Emmy nominations. With 24 nominations,The Crowntied for the most nominated series.Bridgertonwith12 nominations was also nominated for Best Dramaseries whileThe Queen’s Gambitreceived 18 nominationsincluding Best Limited Series.Cobra Kai,EmilyIn Parisand the finale season ofThe Kominsky Methodwere all nominated for Best Comedy series.Beyond this acclaim, these are also among our popularseries on Netflix.\\nOur non-English content investments are growing bothin scope and impact. Our P&L content expensefor this content category has more than doubled inthe past two years. Illustrating how great storiescancome from anywhere and be loved everywhere, part twoofLupinfrom France was our largestnon-English title in the quarter with 54m member householdschoosing this title in its first four weeks.Season four ofElitefrom Spain drew 37m member householdsin its first 28 days, while season two ofWho Killed Sara?built on the success of the firstseason with 34m households choosing the latestinstallment of this gripping thriller from Mexico.\\nAs discussed in previous letters, COVID-related productiondelays in 2020 have led to a lighter first half of2021 slate that will build through the course of theyear. In the first six months of 2021, contentamortization grew only 9% year over year (as comparedto 17% in FY20). COVID and its variants makepredicting the future hard, but with productions largelyrunning smoothly so far, we’re optimistic in ourability to deliver a strong second half slate. Throughthe first half of 2021 we’ve already spent $8 billionin cash on content (up 41% yr-over-yr and 1.4x ourcontent amortization) and we expect contentamortization to be around $12 billion for the fullyear (+12% year over year). Our Q3 slate will includenew seasons of fan favoritesLa Casa de Papel(akaMoney Heist),Sex Education, Virgin RiverandNeverHave I Everas well as live action films includingSweet Girl(starring Jason Momoa),Kissing Booth3, andKate(starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the animatedfeature filmVivo, featuring all-new songs fromLin-Manuel Miranda.\\nWe’re also in the early stages of further expandinginto games, building on our earlier efforts aroundinteractivity (eg,Black Mirror Bandersnatch) andourStranger Thingsgames. We view gaming as anothernew content category for us, similar to our expansioninto original films, animation and unscripted TV.Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscriptionat no additional cost similar to films and series.Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games formobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our moviesand TV series offering and we expect a long runwayof increasing investment and growth across all ofourexisting content categories, but since we are nearlya decade into our push into original programming,we think the time is right to learn more about howour members value games.\\nProduct\\n4\\nWe’re constantly innovating across a broad range of areas to improve the viewing experience and betterserve our members. That’s why this quarter we globallylaunchedPlay Somethingon television, ournewfeaturethat lets Netflix do the work when you don’tfeel like choosing what to watch. Recognizing thatbroadband quality and cost varies around the world,we also improved the Netflix download experienceto enable you to start watching a show or film evenif it hasn’t finished downloading. Once youreconnect, you can complete the partial download andkeep watching — also helping members avoidexceeding their data limits.\\nWe recently expanded our low-cost mobile-only planto an additional 78 countries across South East Asiaand sub-saharan Africa. Like in our other markets,this plan complements our existing three tiers ofservice. In the five markets where we had previouslylaunched a mobile-only plan, we have found thatthe mobile only plan has been an effective way tointroduce more consumers to Netflix while beingroughly revenue neutral as the lower average revenueper membership is offset by incrementalacquisition and generally better retention.\\nCompe tition\\nWe are still very much in the early days of the transitionfrom linear to on-demand consumption ofentertainment. Streaming represents just 27% of USTV screen time, compared with 63% for lineartelevision, according to Nielsen. Based on this samestudy, Nielsen estimates that we are just 7% of USTV screen time. Considering that we are less maturein other countries and that this excludes mobilescreens (where we believe our share of engagementis even lower), we are confident that we have a longrunway for growth. As we improve our service, ourgoal is to continue to increase our share of screentime in the US and around the world.\\n5\\nShare of Total US TV Time, June 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+)\\nSource: Nielsen.\\nThe planned combination of Warner Media Group andDiscovery and Amazon’s pending acquisition ofMGM are examples of the ongoing industry consolidationas firms adapt to a world where streamingsupplants linear TV. The industry has consolidatedmaterially over the years (Time Warner/AT&T,Viacom/CBS, Discovery/Scripps, Disney/Fox, Comcast/NBCU/Sky,etc.) and we don’t believe thisconsolidation has affected our growth much, if atall. While we are continually evaluating opportunities,we don’t view any assets as “must-have” and we haven’tyet found any large scale ones to be sufficientlycompelling to act upon.\\nIn the race to entertain consumers around the world,we continue to compete for screen time with abroad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok(to name just a few). But, we are mostlycompeting with ourselves to improve our service asfast as we can. If we can do that, we’re confidentwecan maintain our strong position and continue to grownicely as we have been over the past two-plusdecades.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nIn Q2, net cash generated by operating activitieswas -$64 million vs. $1 billion in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)for the quarter was-$175 million vs. $899 million in Q2‘20. FCF in lastyear’s2\\nQ2 benefited from COVID-related production shutdowns.We are still expecting full year 2021 free cashflow to be approximately break even. As we discussedpreviously, we believe we no longer have a needto raise external financing to fund our day-to-dayoperations.\\n2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cashprovided by (used in) operating activities, pleaserefer to thereconciliation in tabular form on the attached unauditedfinancial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n6\\nDuring Q2, we increased our revolving credit facility (which remains undrawn) to $1 billion from $750million and extended the maturity from 2024 to 2026.We also repurchased 1m shares for $500 million(at an average per share price of about $500) underour $5 billion share authorization. Our main priorityis to invest in the organic growth of our business while maintaining strong liquidity and retainingfinancial flexibility for strategic investments. Ourgrowing operating profit allows us to complementthispriority with a return of capital to shareholders.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nIn June, the independent sustainability think tankThe Carbon Trustpublished awhite paperexaminingthe carbon impact of video streaming.Key findingsof the work include:\\n●The average carbon footprint for Europe per hour ofvideo streaming is approximately 55gCO2e,equivalent to driving 250 metres in an average petrolcar.\\n●Devices (TVs, laptops/PCs, smartphones, tablets) makeup the largest portion of carbonemissions from streaming (over 50%), compared to othercomponents like energy from datacenters or networks. Good news: Devices are gettingmore efficient over time and total deviceusage is fairly constant (with Netflix gaining sharefrom linear).\\n●Changing resolutions and other viewing settings werefound to result in only a very small changein the carbon impact. Changing from standard definitionto 4K resolution grows transmissionemissions from just under 1g CO2e/hour to just over1g CO2e/hour.\\n●As demand for streaming and other internet servicesincreases, the carbon intensity of theseservices will decrease over time. This is due to (1)networking equipment becoming lessenergy-intensive with technological advances, and(2) increased use of renewable electricity.\\nAs a reminder, our ESG-related information can befound on ourIR website.\\nReference\\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investorletters are:April 2021,January 2021,October 2020,July 2020,April 2020,January 2020,October 2019,July 2019.\\n7\\nRegional Br eakdown\\nJuly 20, 2021 Earnings Interview, 3pm PT\\nOur video interview with Nidhi Gupta of Fidelity Management& Research, Co. will be onyoutube/netflixirat 3pm PT today.

Management believes that free cash flowis an important liquidity metric because it measures,during a given period, the amount of cash generatedthat is available to repay debt obligations, makestrategic acquisitions and investments and for certainother activities like stock repurchases. However,this non-GAAP financial measure should be consideredin addition to, not as a substitute for or superiorto, net income, operating income, diluted earningsper share and net cash provided by (used in)operating activities, or other financial measuresprepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation totheGAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are containedin tabular form on the attached unauditedfinancial statements.\\nForward-Looking StatementsThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-lookingstatements within the meaning of the federalsecurities laws, including statements regarding ourexpected results for the fiscal quarter endingSeptember 30, 2021 and the second half of 2021; investmentin our service; average revenue permembership;adoption of internet entertainment andimpact on growth; competitive position;futurecontent offerings and the number and timing of suchofferings; product enhancements and offerings,including games; cash spending on content; stock repurchases;impact of production delays; futurecapital and external financing needs; debt; globalstreaming paid memberships, paid net additions,membership growth and retention; consolidated revenue,revenue growth, operating income, operatingmargin, net income, content amortization and earningsper share; and free cash flow.

Operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $209 million\\n \\nwith our Q3 global operating margin of 7.0% putting us right on track to achieve our full year target of\\n \\n7%. EPS of $0.29 included a pre-tax $51 million non-cash loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro\\n \\nbond (or $39 million after tax based on a 24% tax rate). Higher than expected excess tax benefit from\\n \\nstock based compensation benefited our tax rate by $5 million vs. our forecast. As a reminder, the\\n \\nquarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.\\n \\n \\nWe added a Q3-record 5.3 million memberships globally (up 49% year-over-year) as we continued to\\n \\nbenefit from strong appetite for our original series and films, as well as the adoption of internet\\n \\nentertainment across the world. Relative to our guidance of 4.4 million net adds, we under-forecasted\\n \\nboth US and international acquisition. Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29% versus last year.\\n \\n \\nDomestic contribution margin in Q3 of 35.8% vs. 36.4% last year was below our forecast of 37.1% due\\n \\nprimarily to the earlier-than-anticipated close of certain content deals. The foreign currency impact in\\n \\nthe quarter was +$13 million and  Q3 international revenue grew 54% year over year, excluding\\n \\ncurrency. F/X-neutral ASP increased 7.4% year over year. International contribution profit margin of\\n \\n4.7% exceeded our 2.3% guidance, also due to the timing of content deals.\\n \\n \\nFor Q4, we forecast global net adds of 6.30m (1.25m in the US and 5.05m internationally) vs. 7.05m in\\n \\nthe year ago quarter (which was our all-time high for quarterly net adds). We recently announced price\\n \\nadjustments in many markets to our HD and 4K video plans while keeping our SD plan mostly unchanged\\n \\n(still $7.99 in the US, for instance). Existing members will be notified and their prices will be adjusted on\\n \\na rolling basis over the next few months. Increased revenue over time will help us grow our content\\n \\noffering and continue our global operating margin growth.\\n \\n \\nWe’ve been focused on growing global operating margin as our primary profitability metric since hitting\\n \\nour 2020 US contribution margin goal of 40% this past Q1. This allows us to avoid near term\\n \\noptimization for specific domestic or international contribution margin targets which could impede our\\n \\nlong term growth. For instance, we anticipate our Q4’17 US contribution margin will be 34.4% (a decline\\n \\nboth year-on-year and sequentially) as we boost our marketing investment against a growing content\\n \\nslate. We spend disproportionately in the US to generate media and influencer awareness for our\\n \\nprogramming which we believe, in turn, is an effective way to facilitate word of mouth globally. In our\\n \\ninternational segment, we are on track to generate positive contribution profit for the full year. As we\\n \\nmove into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing\\n \\noperating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the\\n \\nrest of the world.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nContent\\n \\nFive years ago, we embarked on our original programming strategy and we’re very pleased with our\\n \\nprogress in transforming Netflix from a service with not just second run content but also must-see new\\n \\nreleases, like \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOrange is the New Black\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nHouse of Cards, Fuller House, Making a\\n \\nMurderer, Narcos, The Crown\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\n13 Reasons Why\\n\\u200b\\n, among many others.\\n \\n \\nThis quarter, we launched several new series such as the gritty drama \\n\\u200b\\nOzark\\n\\u200b\\n and comedy \\n\\u200b\\nFriends from\\n \\nCollege\\n\\u200b\\n by Nick Stoller as well as \\n\\u200b\\nMarvel’s The Defenders \\n\\u200b\\nand returning seasons of fan favorites like\\n \\nNarcos \\n\\u200b\\nand \\n\\u200b\\nFuller House\\n\\u200b\\n. We’re also making good strides on original films (as measured by member\\n \\nviewing relative to our investment) with the debut of \\n\\u200b\\nDeath Note\\n\\u200b\\n (based on the popular Japanese IP),\\n \\nNaked\\n\\u200b\\n (a romantic comedy featuring Marlon Wayans) and \\n\\u200b\\nTo the Bone\\n\\u200b\\n (an intense drama starring Lily\\n \\nCollins).\\n \\n \\nInvestors often ask us about continued access to content from diversified media companies.  While we\\n \\nhave multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term\\n \\ntrends are clear. Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around\\n \\nNetflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes. Our\\n \\ninvestment in Netflix originals is over a quarter of our total P&L content budget in 2017 and will\\n \\ncontinue to grow.  With $17 billion in content commitments over the next several years and a growing\\n \\nlibrary of owned content ($2.5 billion net book value at the end of the quarter), we remain quite\\n \\ncomfortable with our ability to please our members around the world. We’ll spend $7-8 billion on\\n \\ncontent (on a P&L basis) in 2018.\\n \\n \\nJust as we moved from second-run content to licensed originals and then to Netflix-produced originals,\\n \\nwe are progressing even further up the value chain to work directly with talented content creators. In\\n \\nAugust, we announced an overall deal with \\n\\u200b\\nShonda Rhimes\\n\\u200b\\n, the creator of global smash hits like \\n\\u200b\\nGrey’s\\n \\nAnatomy\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nHow to Get Away with Murder\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nScandal\\n\\u200b\\n, and others. We also acquired \\n\\u200b\\nMillarworld\\n\\u200b\\n, our one\\n \\nM&A transaction in our 20 year history, the home of legendary comic book writer Mark Millar. Our goal\\n \\nis to work with the best creators in the world and own the underlying intellectual property so that we\\n \\ncan continue to deliver amazing content to our members across the globe.\\n \\n \\nIn working with the best talent, we strive hard for awards recognition. At this year’s Primetime Emmys,\\n \\nwe scored 20 wins out of 92 nominations, second only to HBO, spread across eight different titles.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nSince 2013, we’ve taken the \\n\\u200b\\nLong Term View\\n\\u200b\\n that we’re in the early stages of the worldwide,\\n \\nmulti-decade transition from linear TV to internet entertainment. Recently, it’s been unfolding right\\n \\nbefore our eyes: \\n\\u200b\\nDisney\\n\\u200b\\n announced plans to launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and its other\\n \\nbrands, cable network owners are licensing their channels to virtual MVPDs like Hulu, YouTube, Sling TV,\\n \\nand DirecTV Now, CBS’ All Access is expanding \\n\\u200b\\ninternationally\\n\\u200b\\n, Apple is reportedly planning on spending\\n \\n$1 billion on original content and Amazon is streaming NFL games while its Prime Video service has gone\\n \\nglobal. Facebook launched its \\n\\u200b\\nWatch tab\\n\\u200b\\n for original videos.\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nAt the same time, linear TV networks like \\n\\u200b\\nMTV\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nA&E\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nWGN\\n\\u200b\\n are cutting down on scripted series. Last\\n \\nyear, the number of original scripted series on linear TV (across broadcast, premium and basic cable)\\n \\nbegan to decrease as online services ramped up activity.\\n \\nIt’s an exciting period and both media and technology companies see the same big opportunity as we\\n \\ndo. We have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible to please our\\n \\nmembers by earning their viewing time and to stay ahead of the competition in the decades to come.\\n \\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nIronically, as linear networks move outside of the traditional bundle and into direct-to-consumer\\n \\napplications, we are working more closely than ever with MVPDs/ISPs and other distributors. Building on\\n \\nour Q2 partnership with SFR/Altice in France, where Netflix is sold in a package with high speed Internet\\n \\nand TV services, and an earlier, comparable partnership with Proximus of Belgium, this past quarter we\\n \\nannounced the bundling of Netflix into \\n\\u200b\\nT-Mobile’s ONE family plan\\n\\u200b\\n. Our partners are enthusiastic about\\n \\nthe response to these bundles as the excitement around our big content enhances their offerings.\\n \\n \\nOur goal with all of our partnerships is to make it easy for members to sign up, pay and enjoy Netflix. We\\n \\nare pleased with the early results and we will continue pursuing these bundling opportunities as a\\n \\ncomplement to our core direct-to-consumer approach.\\n \\n \\nFree Cashflow and Capital Structure\\n \\nFree cash flow in Q3 totaled -$465 million vs. -$506 million last year and -$608 million in Q2’17. There is\\n \\nno change to our expectation for FCF of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017.  Negative FCF,\\n \\ndespite growing operating income, is due to growth of our content spend, original content in particular,\\n \\nwhere we pay for the titles before consumers enjoy the content, and the asset is amortized by\\n \\nestimated viewing over time. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market as our\\n \\nafter-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity.\\n \\n \\nSummary\\n \\n \\nThis quarter, among other new offerings, we are releasing the second Netflix original series from David\\n \\nFincher (\\n\\u200b\\nMindhunter), \\n\\u200b\\nnew seasons of our globally acclaimed franchises \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things \\n\\u200b\\nand \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown,\\n \\nour first Italian and German original shows (\\n\\u200b\\nSuburra\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n\\u200b\\n Dark)\\n\\u200b\\n and our most ambitious film yet, \\n\\u200b\\nBright\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nstarring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer.\\n \\n \\nWe feel privileged to be working with great artists all over the world and to be able to bring their\\n \\ncreations to a big, and growing, global audience. We’re delighted that consumers are embracing internet\\n \\nentertainment and are finding value and pleasure in the incredible stories offered by Netflix.\\n \\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are:  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2017\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nOctober 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary, 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2015\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nEarnings Interview, 3pm PST October 16th, 2017\\n\\xa0\\nOur video interview with Doug Mitchelson of UBS will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm PST today.\\n \\nQuestions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to \\n\\u200b\\ndoug.mitchelson@ubs.com\\n\\u200b\\n.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity\\n \\nmetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to\\n \\nrepay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in\\n \\noperations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nshould be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,\\n \\ndiluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures\\n \\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nare contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding growing revenues and our position within internet\\n \\nentertainment; price changes, increasing revenues, content spend and growing margin; marketing\\n \\nspend; investment in Asia and Rest of World markets; our original programming strategy; access to\\n \\ncontent, competition, and partnerships, including bundles; free cash flow and financing; domestic and\\n \\ninternational net, total and paid members; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin\\n \\nfor both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin;\\n \\nnet income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are\\n \\nsubject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without\\n \\nlimitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete\\n \\neffectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms and partnerships for streaming our service;\\n \\nfluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet\\n \\nService Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing\\n \\nin-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that\\n \\ncould cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is\\n \\n5\\n \\nincluded in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on\\n \\nForm 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company\\n \\nprovides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from\\n \\nthese forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on\\n \\nForm 10-K.

Our summary results and forecast are below.\\nQ2 R esults\\nRevenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year (or 13% excluding a -$339 million foreign currency impact), drivenby a 6% and 2% increase in average paid memberships and ARM, respectively. Excluding the impact of1\\nforeign exchange (F/X), ARM rose 7% year over year. The appreciation of the US dollar (USD) vs. mostother currencies since our April earnings report was the primary reason for the variance to our revenueguidance forecast. We slightly under-forecasted global paid net adds in Q2 (-1.0m vs. -2.0m forecast andcompared to +1.5m in the year ago quarter).\\n●In APAC, revenue grew 23% year over year, excluding F/X. At over $900 million of revenue, APACis approaching the size of our LATAM business. We added 1.1m paid memberships in the region(vs. 1.0m last Q2). ARM in APAC was -2% year over year on a F/X neutral basis, due to the impactfrom our price decrease in India last December as well as plan mix, which was partially offset by\\n1ARM\\n(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nhigher ARM in Korea and Australia. Excluding India, APAC ARM grew 4% year over year on aconstant currency basis.\\n●Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM increased 13% and 6% year over year, respectively, whilepaid net additions totaled -0.8m vs. 0.2m in the year ago quarter.\\n●Revenue in LATAM grew 19% year over year excluding F/X and surpassed the $1 billion quarterlymark for the first time, helped by constant currency ARM growth of 15%. Paid membershipswere flat sequentially (compared to 0.8m paid net adds in Q2’21).\\n●In UCAN, ARM and revenue each increased 10% year over year, excluding the impact of F/X. Paidnet adds were -1.3m vs. -0.4m in the year ago period. Retention improved over the course of thequarter and, while churn remains slightly elevated, it is now back near pre-price change levels.\\nWe’ve adjusted our cost structure for our current rate of revenue growth. This resulted in approximately$70 million of severance costs and an $80m non-cash impairment of certain real estate leases primarilyrelated to rightsizing our office footprint. Excluding these items totaling $150 million, and the F/X impactof the stronger US dollar since our April report, operating profit and operating margin were slightlyahead of our guidance forecast.\\nEPS of $3.20 vs. $2.97 a year ago exceeded our guidance forecast of $3.00 due to a $305 millionnon-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognizedbelow operating income in “interest and other income.” Our approximately $5 billion of Euro bondsprovides us with some natural hedge against the Euro for net income, but doesn’t affect operatingincome. Year to date, our gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro debt is $467 million.\\nQ3 F orecast\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. Asalways, we strive for accuracy although the current uncertain macro-economic environment leads toless-than-normal visibility.\\nThe US dollar continues to strengthen meaningfully against most currencies at ahistoric pace, withtheEuro recently falling below the US dollarfor thefirst time in two decades, a significant headwind for allmultinational US companies. We have high exposure to this unprecedented appreciation in the USDbecause nearly 60% of our revenue comes from outside the US and swings in F/X have a large flowthrough to operating profit as most of our expenses are in USD and don’t benefit from a stronger USD.\\nOur Q3 revenue growth forecast of 5% translates into 12% year over year revenue growth on a constantcurrency basis. Similarly, excluding the impact of currency, operating profit growth would be -3% yearover year (vs our forecast decline of -29%) and operating margin would be 20% (vs our forecast of 16%).As we have written in the past, over the medium term, we intend to continue to adjust our business asappropriate given the relative strength of the USD to protect our operating margin and try to avoidimmediate actions that we believe could be detrimental to the business.\\nWe forecast paid net adds for Q3 of +1.0m vs. 4.4m in the year ago quarter. We continue to expect fullyear 2022 operating margin of 19%-20%, excluding the unanticipated $150m of restructuring costs in Q2\\n2\\nnoted above and the material movement in F/X from January 2022, as our guidance was set based onF/X at that time (see ourQ4’21 letter).\\nContent, Mark eting, and Pr oduct\\nLast quarter, we discussed our slowing revenue growth, which we believe is the result of connected TVadoption, account sharing, competition, and macro factors such as sluggish economic growth and theimpacts of the war in Ukraine.\\nWe’ve now had more time to understand these issues, as well as how best to address them. First andforemost, we need to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix. This focus on improving our core servicehas served us well over the past 25 years, and remains our north star to drive continuous growth. It’swhy we strive for an ever better content, marketing and product experience. Also as a pure playstreaming business, we’re unencumbered by legacy revenue streams. This freedom means we can offerbig movies direct-to-Netflix, without the need for extended or exclusive theatrical windows, and letmembers binge watch TV if they want, without having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. Thisfocus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believeto be a significant long term business advantage.\\nOur content offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of member tastes by providing an unmatchedvariety and quality of titles. Our Q2 slate is emblematic of this approach, headlined by season four ofStranger Things, which returned to tremendous fanreception and was a smash hit by all measures -including an outstanding drama Emmy nomination (along withOzarkseason 4 andSquid Game). In itsfirst four weeks,Stranger Thingsseason four generated1.3 billion hours viewed, making it our biggest2\\nseason of English TV ever. Season four also re-ignited interest in past episodes with season one throughthree experiencing a greater than five-fold increase in viewing in the month after the release of seasonfour (vs. the prior month).\\nSeason four ofStranger Thingsalso showcased theeffectiveness of our marketing strategy in drivingconversation around our titles. When we deliver shows and movies that members are talking about inlarge numbers, we can influence pop culture, build passion for Netflix and create an experience that isdifferentiated and difficult-to-replicate. For example, the show catapulted the 1985 songRunning UpThat Hillto thetop of the music charts. Metallicaalso enjoyed a return to the charts in the US and UKwith their 1986 songMaster of Puppetsafter beingfeatured in the new season ofStranger Things. Thecumulative Twitter volume forStranger Thingscontinuesto outpace bothObi-Wan KenobiandTop GunMaverick, highlighting the big conversation aroundthis title and reinforcing that our binge versus oneweek at a time release strategy drives lots of “water cooler conversation.”\\n2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release for each title; since some titles have multiple premieredates, whether weekly or in parts, we count the 28 days from each episode premiere date in each country. Fortitles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 17, 2022. Wepublish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10.\\n3\\nSour ce: T witter.\\nWe also delivered a wide variety of other English language series hits in Q2, including season three ofThe Umbrella Academy(284m view hours*) and seasonone ofThe Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama, whichgenerated 277m hours viewed and has been renewed for a second season. We’ve also renewed theendearing, UK-produced young adult dramaHeartstopper(67m view hours) for another two seasons. Inunscripted, audiences embraced season five ofSellingSunset, which recorded 95m view hours in its firstfour weeks, while the debut season of marriage reality showThe Ultimatumhad 148m view hours.\\nIn unscripted, we are also taking global formats and creating local versions. This quarter, we hadRhythm+ Flow France, our rap competition show, which wasa big local success. The winner of season one, Fresh,was formerly unknown, working in a gym. But since his appearance on the show, he has become a starwith his song CHOP that he performed in the finale hitting #1 on every streaming service in France. Hewas also invited to the Les Ardentes music festival where he performed for an audience of 15,000 people- another example of \"The Netflix Effect.\"\\nWe’re making good progress in film. The basketball dramaHustle(starring Adam Sandler) was ourbiggest Netflix movie in Q2 (186m hours viewed) and was loved by critics and audiences alike, followedby the comedySenior Year, starring Rebel Wilson,with 161m view hours.\\nWe continue to invest in animated features; building off our initial titles likeOver the MoonandBacktothe Outback, we releasedThe Sea Beast(102m hoursviewed*) early in Q3 to audience and criticalacclaim. Today, we announced that we will be acquiring leading animation studioAnimal Logic, with~800 amazing people mostly in Sydney and Vancouver, which will help us accelerate the development ofour animation production capabilities and reinforces our commitment to build a world-class animationstudio. We’ve been partnering with Animal Logic for two years now, working onThe Magician’s Elephant(directed by Wendy Rogers) and the recently announcedThe Shrinking of the Treehorns(directed by RonHoward). Together, we’ll create an animation studio that will produce some of our largest animated\\n4\\nfeature films. We’ll fund the purchase from our existing cash balance. The deal is subject to certainregulatory approvals and we anticipate closing later this year.\\nWe’re building on our lead in non-English programming. We want Netflix to be relevant to audiences allover the globe and our local language titles are a differentiator for us. We focus first on telling authenticstories for local impact, but we see that great stories can travel everywhere. Another example of this InQ2 wasThe Marked Heart, a Colombian series, whichfound a global audience and ended up in the top10 in 81 countries around the world by its second week.  Similarly,The Takedown, a French film, wasinthe top 10 in 91 countries around the world by its second week, again showing the power of anauthentic story and our ability to serve those stories - with subtitling, dubbing, and personalizeddiscovery - for members to enjoy around the world.\\nWhile we always have room to improve, we’re very pleased with how far we’ve come in providing somuch satisfaction and enjoyment to our members. For instance, in the US, which is one of the mostcompetitive markets in the world, we drewmore TVviewing time than any other outletduring the2021-22 TV season (see chart below), nearly matching the combined total of the two most watchedbroadcast networks. And, as Nielsen will announce on Thursday, our share of US TV viewing reached anall-time high of 7.7% in June (vs. 6.6% in June 2021), demonstrating our ability to grow our engagementshare as we continue to improve our service.\\nSource:Nielsen.\\nSince our launch of a small selection of licensed mobile games last November, we’ve released newgames every few weeks, with the portfolio growing to the current total of 24. The games are all intendedto be accessible to broad audiences, and span several genres and categories, including racing withAsphalt Xtreme, the digital version of the irreverentcard gameExploding Kittens, zombies inInto theDead 2and the knitting for cats inKnittens. We’vehad millions of our members play games through theservice and we are learning about what games work for different audiences. We’re adapting our\\n5\\nlicensing and partner-based development activities in response to these learnings. We’ve also acquiredthree games studios (Night School Studios, Boss Fight Studios, and Next Games) which gives us a rangeof expertise in multiple geographies to accelerate the buildout of our internal development capacity. Weare building a solid pipeline of new games that will launch over the next several years and are excited tosee our members engage with these titles.\\nNear T erm F ocus\\nIn the near term, a key priority to re-accelerate revenue growth is to evolve and improve ourmonetization. In the early days of streaming, we kept our pricing very simple with just one plan level. In2014, we introduced three price tiers to better segment demand. Going forward, we will focus on bettermonetizing usage through both continued optimization of our pricing and tiering structures as well asthe addition of a new, lower-priced ad-supported tier.\\nAdvertisingOur lower priced advertising-supported offering will complementour existing plans, which will remainad-free. Our global ARM has grown at a 5% compoundannual rate from 2013 to 2021, so it makes sensenow to give consumers a choice for a lower priced option with advertisements, if they desire it.\\nWe recentlyannouncedMicrosoft as our technologyand sales partner and we’re targeting to launch thistier around the early part of 2023. They are investing heavily to expand their multi-billion advertisingbusiness into premium television video, and we are thrilled to be working with such a strong globalpartner. We’re excited by the opportunity given the combination of our very engaged audience and highquality content, which we think will attract premium CPMs from brand advertisers.\\nWe’ll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant. Like most of our newinitiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So,our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one.Over time, our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that’s more seamless andrelevant for consumers, and more effective for our advertising partners. While it will take some time togrow our member base for the ad tier and the associated ad revenues, over the long run, we thinkadvertising can enable substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth(through ad revenues).\\nPaid SharingWe’re in the early stages of working to monetize the 100m+ households that are currently enjoying, butnot directly paying for, Netflix. We know this will be a change for our members. As such, we havelaunchedtwo different approachesin Latin Americato learn more. Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paidsharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.We’re encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in LatinAmerica.\\n6\\nSimplicityAt Netflix, focus remains very important to us. These initiatives - paid sharing and advertising - dointroduce some additional complexity, but our approach has always been tokeep our business model assimple as possible within the context of our growth objectives. In this vein, these initiatives are similarto expanding into originals, launching our service across the world, and building our own studio, each ofwhich also increased complexity but are natural extensions intended to enhance our existing business.\\nF/X Neutr al Oper ating Mar gin Disclosur e\\nTo provide additional transparency around our operating margin, we’ll now disclose our year-to-date(YTD) operating margin based on F/X ratesat the beginningof each year.  This will allow investors to seehow our operating margin is tracking against our target (which was set in January of 2022 based on F/Xrates at that time), absent intra-year fluctuations in F/X (which have beensubstantial in 2022).\\nAs can be seen from the table below, F/X-driven changes to our revenue have a high flow through tooperating income (the operating profit impact ranges from ~75% to 80%+ of the revenue impact). This isbecause the bulk of our expenses don’t change with F/X fluctuations.\\n* Based on F /X rates at the beginning of each y ear. YTD 2022 thr ough June 30, 2022. Not e: Ther e were no adjus tmen ts tocontent amortiz ation f or the purposes of this c alcula tion, as titles ar e amortiz ed a t the his torical blended r ate at the time ofcapitalization.\\n7\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was +$103 million vs. -$64 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)in the quarter totaled+$13 million, compared with  -$175 million in Q2’21.3\\nCash declined $190m sequentially, primarily due to our Next Games acquisition ($69m) and the F/Ximpact on cash ($145m). As we’ve discussed previously, we are now self-funding. For the full year 2022,we expect FCF to be approximately +$1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars (assuming nomaterial further movements in F/X).\\nWe expect annual positive FCF going forward (with substantial growth in FCF in 2023 vs. 2022) due to ourincreasing revenue, solid profitability, and the successful multi-year evolution of our content model.We’re now more than a decade into transforming our service from licensed second run content tomostly Netflix originals - including more than five years into building out our internal studio to producethe majority of our original titles (60% of our net content assets on our balance sheet areNetflix-produced). We’re now through the most cash-intensive part of that transition. As a result, ourcash content spend-to-content amortization expense ratio peaked at 1.6x (along with peak negative FCFof -$3.3B in 2019) and is expected to be about 1.2-1.3x in 2022 and to decline going forward, based onour current plans, which assume no material expansion into new content categories in ‘23.\\n2022 es tima te based on the midpoin t of 1.2x -1.3x r ange.\\n3\\nFor a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes \\nthereto.\\n8\\nGross debt at quarter end amounted to $14.3 billion, within our targeted range of $10-$15 billion. Withcash of $5.8 billion, net debt totaled $8.5 billion, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA. Our capital structure policy4\\nremains unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund newgrowth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimumcash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (eg, about $5.3 billion based on Q2 revenue). Aftermeeting those needs, our intent is to return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nAt this year’s annual meeting in June, shareholders approved proposals to declassify our board, removesupermajority voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings. We’vealso changed the voting standard for our directors to simple majority in uncontested elections. Ourgovernance structure is now similar to other large cap company governance structures.\\nWith more than one billion people living with some form of disability, we want to ensure Netflix is asaccessible as possible. In Q2, we announced that we are expanding the availability of audio descriptionsand subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing to a total of 20 languages - work that recently won theprestigiousDr. Jacob Bolotin Award. We’ve also introducednew badges for our titles that have audiodescriptions and subtitles on laptop and iOS, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first.\\nSummar y\\nReaccelerating our revenue growth is a big challenge. But we’ve been through hard times before. We’vebuilt this company to be flexible and adaptable and this will be a great test for us and our highperformance culture. We’re fortunate to be in a position of strength as the leader in streamingentertainment by all metrics (revenue, engagement, subscribers, profit and free cash flow). We’reconfident and optimistic about the future.\\nReference\\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are:April 2022,January 2022,October 2021,July 2021,April 2021,January 2021,October 2020,July 2020.\\n4\\nDefined as net debt divided by last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA (Net income before interest \\nexpense and other income/expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and \\nequipment and further adjusted to exclude other non-cash charges).\\n9\\nRegional Br eakdown\\nJuly 19, 2022 Earnings Interview, 3pm PT\\nOur video interview with Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan will be onyoutube/netflixirat 3pm PT today.Questions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to douglas.anmuth@jpmorgan.com.Reed Hastings, co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, co-CEO & Chief Content Officer, Greg Peters, COO & Chief ProductOfficer, Spence Neumann, CFO,  and Spencer Wang, VP of IR/Corporate Development will all be on thevideo to answer Doug’s questions.\\n10\\nIR Contact:Spencer WangVP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development408 809-5360PR Contact:Emily FeingoldVP, Corporate Communications323 287-0756\\nUse of Non-GAAP MeasuresThis shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of F/Xneutral operating margin, free cash flow, last twelve months (“LTM”) EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA.Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquiditymetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available torepay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities likestock repurchases.

       "  'content': \"January 22, 2018\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\n \\nWe had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew\\n \\nstreaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million\\n \\nin 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than\\n \\ndoubled global operating income.\\n \\n.\\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nQ4 Results\\n \\nAverage paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in\\n \\nASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5%\\n \\nmargin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating\\n \\nmargin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year.\\n \\n \\nEPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items\\n \\nthat affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X\\n \\nremeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which\\n \\npartially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed\\n \\nrepatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform.\\n \\n \\nIn Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last\\n \\nyear’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than\\n \\nexpected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet\\n \\nentertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based.\\n \\nIn the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3\\n \\nmillion. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although\\n \\ncontribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the\\n \\nmarketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter.\\n \\n \\nInternationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record\\n \\nfor quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue\\n \\nand ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments\\n \\nin a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017\\n \\n(4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution\\n \\nprofit in our history.\\n \\n \\nWe took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward\\n \\nwith. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected\\n \\nexpense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger\\n \\nthan expected member growth and the timing of international content spend.\\n \\nForecast\\n \\nThe guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net\\n \\nadds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally.\\n \\nAs we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year\\n \\n2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year.\\n \\n \\nWe believe our big investments in content are paying off.  In 2017, average streaming hours per\\n \\nmembership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more\\n \\nrevenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nBig hits like \\n\\u200b\\n13 Reasons Why\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nBright \\n\\u200b\\nresult from a combination of great content and\\n \\ngreat marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about\\n \\n$1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content,\\n \\nand we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll\\n \\ngrow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018.\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nQ4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nBlack\\n \\nMirror\\n\\u200b\\n as well as \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n\\u200b\\n In the quarter, we\\n \\nalso successfully launched new titles like the limited series \\n\\u200b\\nGodless\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nMarvel’s The Punisher\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n \\nMindhunter\\n\\u200b\\n (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s\\n \\namazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had \\n\\u200b\\nthree of the Top\\n \\n5\\n\\u200b\\n most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row.\\n \\n \\nOur largest investment in original films to date, \\n\\u200b\\nBright, \\n\\u200b\\na fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a\\n \\nmajor success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, \\n\\u200b\\nBright\\n\\u200b\\n has become one of our\\n \\nmost viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well\\n \\nas additional investment in original films.\\n \\n \\nWe’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nClub de\\n \\nCuervos \\n\\u200b\\nas well as \\n\\u200b\\nThe Day I Met El Chapo,\\n\\u200b\\n both of which are from Mexico; \\n\\u200b\\nSuburra\\n\\u200b\\n from Italy; and an\\n \\nunscripted series from the UK, \\n\\u200b\\nJack Whitehall: Travels with My Father\\n\\u200b\\n. We also debuted \\n\\u200b\\nDark\\n\\u200b\\n, our first\\n \\nGerman original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for\\n \\ninstance, \\n\\u200b\\nDark\\n\\u200b\\n, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions\\n \\nof members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with\\n \\nattractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this\\n \\ninitiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland,\\n \\nIndia, Korea and Japan.\\n \\n \\nWe are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall\\n \\ndeals with \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n producer Shawn Levy and \\n\\u200b\\nOrange is the New Black\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nGLOW\\n\\u200b\\n creator Jenji\\n \\nKohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over\\n \\nthe world.\\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our\\n \\nmutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix,\\n \\nwhile our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of\\n \\nthese types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche\\n \\nTelekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC\\n \\nremoved the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net\\n \\n3\\n \\nneutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the\\n \\nFCC’s action.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nWe have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend\\n \\nbecomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On\\n \\nthe commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large\\n \\ncontent budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with\\n \\nApple Music or with iOS.\\n \\n \\nFacebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their\\n \\nmulti-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for\\n \\nentertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix.\\n \\n \\nTraditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring\\n \\nmost of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand\\n \\nand great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful\\n \\nservices. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content\\n \\nofferings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.\\n \\n \\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nIn Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower\\n \\nend of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of\\n \\ncontent payments, which will now occur in 2018.\\n \\n \\nOur operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is\\n \\ncontent. When we develop a title like \\n\\u200b\\nBright\\n\\u200b\\n, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated\\n \\nmembership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for\\n \\nself-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect\\n \\nthat in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend\\n \\nwill turn our business FCF positive.\\n \\n \\nIn the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re\\n \\ngrowing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had\\n \\nplanned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018.  Given our track record of content\\n \\ninvestments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the\\n \\nincreased investments we are making in original content this year.\\n \\n \\nWe anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of\\n \\ninterest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to\\n \\ngrow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt.  High yield has rarely seen\\n \\nan equity cushion so thick.\\n \\n4\\n \\nBoard of Directors\\n \\nWe are pleased to add \\n\\u200b\\nRodolphe Belmer\\n\\u200b\\n to our board of directors. Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+\\n \\nGroup in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing\\n \\npercentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our\\n \\nboard.\\n \\n \\nSummary\\n \\nOur goal is to entertain people. We are thrilled to be able to do that at great scale.\\n \\n \\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2017\\n\\u200b\\n,  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2017\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJanuary 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary, 2016\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nJanuary 22, 2018 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST\\n \\nOur video interview with Todd Juenger of Bernstein will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm PST today.\\n \\nQuestions that investors would like Todd to ask should be sent to \\n\\u200b\\ntodd.juenger@bernstein.com\\n\\u200b\\n. \\n\\u200b\\nReed\\n \\nHastings, CEO, David Wells, CFO, Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Greg Peters, Chief Product Officer\\n \\nand Spencer Wang, VP of IR/Corporate Development will be answering Todd’s questions.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIR Contact:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSpencer Wang\\n \\n  Vice President, Finance/IR & Corporate Development\\n \\n  408 809-5360\\n \\n \\n \\nPR Contact:\\n \\n \\nJonathan Friedland\\n \\nChief Communications Officer\\n \\n \\n310 734-2958\\n \\n \\n \\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free\\n \\ncash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity\\n \\nmetrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to\\n \\nrepay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in\\n \\noperations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nshould be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,\\n \\ndiluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures\\n \\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nare contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding our investments in marketing, technology and\\n \\n5\\n \\ndevelopment, and content, including original content; content and product partnerships; impact of U.S.\\n \\nnet neutrality rules; growth of internet video and competitive landscape; future capital raises;\\n \\nexpectations of positive free cash flow, impact of the new limitation on the deductibility of interest;\\n \\ndomestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and\\n \\ncontribution margin for both domestic and international operations, as well as consolidated operating\\n \\nincome, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking\\n \\nstatements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events\\n \\nto differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;\\n \\nour ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;\\n \\nfluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet\\n \\nService Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing\\n \\nin-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that\\n \\ncould cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is\\n \\nincluded in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on\\n \\nForm 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017.

       "  'content': \"April 21, 2020\\n \\nFellow Shareholders,\\n \\nIn our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has\\n \\nreached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one\\n \\nknows how or when this terrible crisis will end. What’s clear is the escalating human cost in terms of lost\\n \\nlives and lost jobs, with tens of millions of people now out of work.\\n \\n \\nAt Netflix, we’re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to\\n \\npeople confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to\\n \\nmedium term. Like other home entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and\\n \\nincreased membership growth. In our case, this is offset by a sharply stronger US dollar, depressing our\\n \\ninternational revenue, resulting in revenue-as-forecast. \\n\\u200b\\nWe expect viewing to decline and membership\\n \\ngrowth to decelerate as home confinement ends, which we hope is soon.\\n \\n \\nBy helping people connect with stories they love, we are able to provide comfort and escape as well as a\\n \\nsense of community during this pandemic. So our focus has been on maintaining the quality of our\\n \\nservice while our employees around the world adapt to working from home.\\n \\n \\nFor the most part, this has gone smoothly. Our product teams, for example, have been relatively\\n \\nunaffected. As a precaution, we have temporarily reduced the number of product innovations we try,\\n \\nwhile continuing to release features that we know will add meaningful value for our members, such as\\n \\nimproved parental controls.\\n \\n \\nHowever, we have seen significant disruption when it comes to customer support and content\\n \\nproduction. On the customer support side, we’ve now fixed most of our work-from-home challenges. In\\n \\naddition, we’ve taken on another 2,000 agents (all working remotely), so our customer service levels are\\n \\nalmost fully restored despite the increased demand.\\n \\n \\nWhen it comes to production, almost all filming has now been stopped globally, with the exception of a\\n \\nfew countries like Korea and Iceland. This has been devastating for millions of workers in the TV and film\\n \\nindustry - electricians, hair and make-up artists, carpenters and drivers who are often paid hourly wages\\n \\nand work project-to-project.\\n \\n \\nIn March, we created a \\n\\u200b\\n$100 million fund\\n\\u200b\\n to help with hardship in the industry, starting with the hardest\\n \\nhit workers on our productions, where Netflix has the greatest responsibility. We will have paid these\\n \\ncrews for about seven weeks, with the goal of providing a bridge until government safety nets kick in. In\\n \\naddition, we’re donating $30 million to third parties and non-profits, providing emergency relief to\\n \\nout-of-work crew and cast across the broader TV and film industry in countries where we have a large\\n \\nproduction base.\\n \\n \\nThis includes donations of $1 million each to the \\n\\u200b\\nSAG-AFTRA Foundation COVID-19 Disaster Fund\\n\\u200b\\n, the\\n \\nMotion Picture and Television Fund\\n\\u200b\\n and the \\n\\u200b\\nActors Fund Emergency Assistance\\n\\u200b\\n in the US, and $1 million\\n \\nbetween the \\n\\u200b\\nAFC\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nFondation des Artistes\\n\\u200b\\n in Canada. These are all well established hardship funds. In\\n \\n1\\n \\nother countries where no such funds exist, we’ve been working to set them up, including in the UK (£1\\n \\nmillion) with the \\n\\u200b\\nBritish Film Institute\\n\\u200b\\n, in Italy (\\n€\\n1 million) with the \\n\\u200b\\nItalian Film Commission\\n\\u200b\\n, in France (\\n€\\n1\\n \\nmillion) with \\n\\u200b\\nAudiens\\n\\u200b\\n, in Brazil (R$5 million) with the \\n\\u200b\\nBrazilian Institute of Audiovisual Content\\n\\u200b\\n, in Mexico\\n \\n($1 million) with the \\n\\u200b\\nMexican Academy of Film Arts and Sciences\\n\\u200b\\n, in Spain (\\n\\u200b\\n€\\n\\u200b\\n1 million) with the \\n\\u200b\\nMinistry\\n \\nof Culture and Sport, Accion Cultural and the Film Academy\\n\\u200b\\n and in the Netherlands (\\n\\u200b\\n€\\n\\u200b\\n1 million) with the\\n \\nNetherlands Film Fund\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nIn total, we have committed to spend $150 million supporting the industry through this crisis.\\n \\n \\nNetflix’s culture is designed to empower decision making at all levels of the company. Throughout this\\n \\ncrisis, our employees have been working tirelessly to maintain the quality of our service and to find\\n \\nquick, practical solutions to the problems Netflix and our partners face.\\n \\n \\nFor example, within two weeks of the shelter-in-place orders coming into effect in Los Angeles, most of\\n \\nour animation production team was back up and running, working from home. On the post production\\n \\nside, we’ve been able to get 200+ projects going remotely. Most of our series writers’ rooms are\\n \\noperating virtually. However, we’ve been unable to create dubs in Italian and some other languages due\\n \\nto home confinement of our voice talent for a handful of titles launching in April and May. But we hope\\n \\nthat with the help of guilds around the world, voice actors can be set up from home, ensuring that they\\n \\ncan stay safe and continue to earn a living. Similar efforts are underway for both music and visual\\n \\neffects.\\n \\n \\nThis pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a strong Internet like never before. Over the years,\\n \\nwe’ve invested heavily in Open Connect, a pioneering caching system that puts our library of content as\\n \\nclose to members’ homes as possible. This enables ISPs to run their networks more efficiently and at a\\n \\nlower cost. However, given the surge in internet use, networks in some countries have struggled to\\n \\ncope.\\n \\n \\nIn March, we were asked by a number of governments and ISPs to temporarily reduce the network\\n \\ntraffic of our members. Using our Open Connect technology, our engineering team was able to respond\\n \\nimmediately, \\n\\u200b\\nreducing network use by 25 percent\\n\\u200b\\n virtually overnight in those countries, while also\\n \\nsubstantially maintaining the quality of our service, including in higher definition. We’re now working\\n \\nwith ISPs to help increase capacity so that we can lift these limitations as conditions improve.\\n \\n \\nNetflix employees have been outstanding and to help them support their local communities, we’ve\\n \\ndoubled our charitable match giving program for 2020. So for every $1 donated by our employees to an\\n \\norganization, we now donate an additional $2 to that organization.\\n \\n \\nLast, and most important of all, we want to say thank you on behalf of all our employees to the heroic\\n \\ndoctors, nurses and first responders fighting this pandemic on the frontlines and the grocery, restaurant\\n \\nand other essential workers who take risks to make sure our families are fed and taken care of. We are\\n \\ntruly inspired and humbled by you.\\n \\nOur summary results for Q1 and our Q2 forecast can be found in the table below.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nQ1 Results and Q2 Forecast\\n \\nDespite paid net additions that were higher than forecast, revenue was in-line with our guidance due to\\n \\nthe appreciation in the US dollar vs. other currencies. Excluding a -$115m impact from F/X, streaming\\n \\nARPU grew 8% year over year. Operating margin of 16.6% (vs. 10.2% in the prior year quarter) was lower\\n \\nthan our 18.0% forecast as we incurred $218m in incremental content costs due to paused productions\\n \\nand hardship fund commitments (a 3.8 percentage point impact to operating margin).\\n \\n \\nThere are three primary effects on our financial performance from the crisis. First, our membership\\n \\ngrowth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement. Second, our international revenue will\\n \\nbe less than previously forecast due to the dollar rising sharply. Third, due to the production shutdown,\\n \\nsome cash spending on content will be delayed, improving our free cash flow, and some title releases\\n \\nwill be delayed, typically by a quarter. More on each of these three effects below.\\n \\n \\nDuring the first two months of Q1, our membership growth was similar to the prior two years, including\\n \\nin UCAN. Then, with lockdown orders in many countries starting in March, many more households\\n \\njoined Netflix to enjoy entertainment. This timing of paid membership additions also affected our Q1’20\\n \\nglobal streaming ARPU; this was the primary driver of the sequential decline in streaming ARPU as the\\n \\nrevenue impact from these additions late in the quarter will be mostly felt in Q2’20 and beyond.\\n \\nHopefully, progress against the virus will allow governments to lift the home confinement soon. As that\\n \\nhappens, we expect viewing and growth to decline. Our internal forecast and guidance is for 7.5 million\\n \\nglobal paid net additions in Q2. Given the uncertainty on home confinement timing, this is mostly\\n \\nguesswork. The actual Q2 numbers could end up well below or well above that, depending on many\\n \\n3\\n \\nfactors including when people can go back to their social lives in various countries and how much people\\n \\ntake a break from television after the lockdown. Some of the lockdown growth will turn out to be\\n \\npull-forward from the multi-year organic growth trend, resulting in slower growth after the lockdown is\\n \\nlifted country-by-country. Intuitively, the person who didn’t join Netflix during the entire confinement is\\n \\nnot likely to join soon after the confinement. Plus, last year we had new seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n \\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n in Q3, which were not planned for this year’s Q3. Therefore, we currently guess that\\n \\nQ3’20 and Q4’20 will have lower net additions than last year due to these effects.\\n \\n \\nSecond, partially due to the crisis, the US dollar has appreciated significantly, which creates a drag on\\n \\ninternational revenue growth. As an example, the price for our standard plan in Brazil is R$33, which\\n \\nused to be $8.5 last year but now is $6.5 based on April 2020 F/X rates, so we have a ~25% decline in US\\n \\ndollar average subscription price from Brazil, which offsets strong membership growth.\\n \\n \\nThird, we’ve paused most of our productions across the world in response to government lockdowns\\n \\nand guidance from local public health officials. In Q2, there is only a modest impact on our new releases,\\n \\nwhich is primarily language dubbing. No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart\\n \\nphysical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible,\\n \\nand how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages, and post-production) will play out. The\\n \\nimpact on us is less cash spending this year as some content projects are pushed out. We are working\\n \\nhard to complete the content we know our members want and we’re complementing this effort with\\n \\nadditional licensed films and series.\\n \\n \\nOur content competitors and suppliers will be impacted about as much as we are, in terms of new titles.\\n \\nSince we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our\\n \\nmember satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers’ by a shortage of new content, but it will take\\n \\ntime to tell.\\n \\n \\nWe continue to target a 16% operating margin for the full year 2020, despite the extra costs in Q1. As a\\n \\nreminder, more than half of our revenue is not denominated in US dollars and we don’t hedge our\\n \\nforeign exchange exposure. If the US dollar remains at these elevated levels (or strengthens further), we\\n \\nmay target modestly slower growth in our annual operating margin progression next year. Given that\\n \\nlead time, we believe we can readjust our model to be appropriate in that new stronger US dollar world.\\n \\nContent\\n \\nAs people shelter at home, our hope is that we can help make that experience more bearable by\\n \\nproviding a diverse range of high quality content for our members. While our productions are largely\\n \\npaused around the world, we benefit from a large pipeline of content that was either complete and\\n \\nready for launch or in post-production when filming stopped.\\n \\nFor Q2, we’re looking forward to releasing all of our originally planned shows and films (with some\\n \\nlanguage dubbing impacts on a few titles). We’re also finding ways to bolster our programming this year\\n \\n- including the recent acquisition of Paramount’s and Media Rights Capital’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Lovebirds\\n\\u200b\\n, a comedy\\n \\nstarring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, for Q2’20 and Legendary Pictures’ \\n\\u200b\\nEnola Holmes\\n\\u200b\\n starring Millie\\n \\nBobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin, for Q3 ‘20. So, while we’re certainly\\n \\n4\\n \\nimpacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety\\n \\nof new titles throughout 2020 and 2021.\\n \\nOur Q1 slate highlighted the variety of content that people enjoy en masse all over the world on Netflix:\\n \\nscripted English language series like \\n\\u200b\\nOzark\\n\\u200b\\n season 3 (a projected 29m member households will have\\n \\nchosen to watch this season in its first four weeks), the riveting docu-series \\n\\u200b\\nTiger King: Murder, Mayhem\\n \\nand Madness \\n\\u200b\\n(64m), our breakthrough unscripted dating show \\n\\u200b\\nLove is Blind\\n\\u200b\\n (30m), original film \\n\\u200b\\nSpenser\\n \\nConfidential\\n\\u200b\\n (85m), and season four of the Spanish language hit \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel\\n\\u200b\\n, aka \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n (a\\n \\nprojected 65m), which debuted in early April.\\n \\nIn Q2, we are looking forward to the launch of\\n\\u200b\\n Space Force\\n\\u200b\\n, our new original comedy series created by\\n \\nGreg Daniels (\\n\\u200b\\nThe Office\\n\\u200b\\n) and Steve Carell, starring Carell, John Malkovich and Lisa Kudrow. We just\\n \\nlaunched our latest buzzy unscripted series \\n\\u200b\\nToo Hot to Handle,\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\n#BlackAF\\n\\u200b\\n from Kenya Barris and, outside\\n \\nthe US, the Michael Jordan documentary \\n\\u200b\\nThe Last Dance\\n\\u200b\\n, which we co-produced with ESPN (launching\\n \\non Netflix in the US on July 19)\\n\\u200b\\n. \\n\\u200b\\nWe will also premiere\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nHollywood\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nfrom Ryan Murphy, and, later this\\n \\nweek, \\n\\u200b\\nExtraction\\n\\u200b\\n, a large scale action film starring Chris Hemsworth and directed by Sam Hargrave, who\\n \\nwas the stunt coordinator and choreographer on films like \\n\\u200b\\nAvengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War,\\n \\nDeadpool 2, \\n\\u200b\\nand\\n\\u200b\\n Captain America: Civil War.\\n \\n \\nProduct\\n \\nIn February, we rolled out our \\n\\u200b\\nTop 10 most popular lists\\n\\u200b\\n to nearly 100 countries, after testing this\\n \\nfeature last year in the UK and Mexico. In each of these countries, there are now three daily lists: Top 10\\n \\noverall, Top 10 series and Top 10 films. Our goal with this feature is to help members find great TV\\n \\nshows and films and enable them to be part of the cultural zeitgeist in their country.\\n \\nRecently, we’ve also enhanced our parental controls for our service to improve the experience for family\\n \\nmembers of all ages. \\n\\u200b\\nUpdates\\n\\u200b\\n include (i) PIN-controlled access to content by maturity level; (ii) the\\n \\nability to PIN protect specific titles as well as profiles; (iii) Profile-level content filtering; (iv) the ability to\\n \\ncreate kids’ experiences that can be customized for different age groups (‘teens and below,’ ‘older kids\\n \\nand below’ and ‘little kids’); and (v) the ability to disable post-play for kids from account settings.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nIn Q1, net cash used in operating activities was +$260 million vs. -$380 million in the prior year period.\\n \\nFree cash flow\\n totaled +$162 million compared with -$460 million in the year ago quarter. As we stated\\n \\n1\\nlast quarter, our FCF profile is beginning to improve due to growing operating margin and profits and as\\n \\nwe digest our big move into the production of Netflix originals (which requires more cash upfront vs.\\n \\nlater-window content) that started five years ago.\\n \\n \\nWith our productions currently paused, this will shift out some cash spending on content to future\\n \\nyears. As a result, we’re now expecting 2020 FCF of -$1 billion or better (compared with our prior 2020\\n \\nexpectation of -$2.5 billion and -$3.3 billion actual in 2019). This dynamic may result in more lumpiness\\n \\n1\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the\\n \\nreconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n \\n5\\n \\nin our path to sustained FCF profitability (as, prior to the pandemic, we had been planning for annual\\n \\nimprovement in FCF). However, there has been no material change to our overall time table to reach\\n \\nconsistent annual positive FCF and we believe that 2019 will still represent the peak in our annual FCF\\n \\ndeficit.\\n \\nWe finished the quarter with cash of $5.2 billion, while our $750m unsecured credit facility remains\\n \\nundrawn. Combined with our improved FCF outlook for 2020, we have more than 12 months of liquidity\\n \\nand substantial financial flexibility.

Fullyear revenue of $30 billion grew 19% year over year while operating income of $6.2 billion rose 35% yearover year. We finished Q4 with 222m paid memberships (with 8.3m paid net adds in Q4). Even in a worldof uncertainty and increasing competition, we’re optimistic about our long-term growth prospects asstreaming supplants linear entertainment around the world. We\\'re continually improving Netflix so thatwe can please our members, grow our share of leisure time and lead in this transition. Our summaryresults and forecast are below.\\nQ4 R esults and Q1 F orecast\\nRevenue in Q4’21 grew 16% year over year with a 9% increase in average paid memberships. ARMrose1\\n7% year over year on both a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, two percentage pointsfaster than Q3’21 (ex-F/X). Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 8%, a six percentage point decrease vs.the year ago period. The decline in operating margin was expected given our large content slate in Q4this year. Operating margin was above our beginning of quarter forecast of 6.5% due to slightly lowerthan forecasted content spend. As a result, our full year operating margin was 21% vs. 18% in 2020,\\n1ARM\\n(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nabove our 20% guidance forecast. EPS in Q4 of $1.33 vs. $1.19 a year ago included a $104m non-cashunrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\nWe slightly over-forecasted paid net adds in Q4 (8.3m actual compared to the 8.5m paid net adds in boththe year ago quarter and our beginning of quarter projection). For the full year 2021, paid net addstotaled 18m vs 37m in 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with more than 90% of our paid netadds in 2021 coming from outside the UCAN region.\\nNonetheless, our UCAN region added 1.2m paid memberships in Q4’21 (vs. 0.9m last year), marking ourstrongest quarter of member growth in this region since the early days of COVID-19 in 2020. In APAC, weincreased paid memberships by 2.6m (vs. 2.0m in the year ago quarter) with strong growth in both Japanand India. EMEA was our largest contributor to paid net adds in Q4 (3.5m vs. 4.5m in the prior yearperiod) and the region delivered record quarterly revenue, exceeding $2.5 billion for the first time.LATAM paid net adds totaled 1.0m vs. 1.2m last year.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and in others it willbe low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there willnaturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net adds performance vs. forecast.\\nFor Q1’22, we forecast paid net adds of 2.5m vs. 4.0m in the year ago quarter. Our guidance reflects amore back-end weighted content slate in Q1’22 (for example,BridgertonS2 and our new original filmThe Adam Projectwill both be launching in March).In addition, while retention and engagement remainhealthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels. We think this may be due toseveral factors including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts ofthe world like LATAM.\\n2\\nFor 2022, we are currently targeting an operating margin of 19%-20% (assuming no material swings inforeign currency from current levels). Our operating margin outlook is driven by two main factors. First,as seen in the chart below, we delivered above the three percentage point annual linear progressionover the past two years (average of four percentage points per year).\\nSecond, theUS dollar has strengthened meaningfullyagainst most other currencies. With ~60% of ourrevenue outside of the US due to our international success, we estimate that the US dollar’s appreciationover the past six months has cost us roughly $1 billion in expected 2022 revenue (as a reminder, wedon’t hedge). With the vast majority of our expenses in US dollars, this translates into an estimated twopercentage point negative impact on our 2022 operating margin.\\nAs we have written in the past, over the medium term we believe we can adjust our pricing and coststructure for a stronger US dollar world. In the near term, we want to continue to invest appropriately inour business and don’t want to over-react to F/X fluctuations to the detriment of our long term growth.There is no change to our goal of steadily growing our operating margin at an average increase of threepercentage points per year over any few year period.\\n3\\nContent\\nOur Q4 content slate epitomizes what we strive for: a wide variety of quality TV series and films. We hada number of big hits in Q4. We released new seasons of returning shows likeThe Witcher(484 millionhours viewed),You(468m hours viewed),Emily inParis(287 million hours viewed) and on December 31,2\\nCobra Kai(274m hours viewed*), as well as the criticallyacclaimed limited seriesMaid(469m hoursviewed). The dystopian Korean thrillerSquid Game- a late Q3 release that broke through globally early inQ4 - generated 1.65 billion hours viewed in its first four weeks and is now our biggest TV season ever.The fourth quarter also featured the conclusion to one of our most popular shows -La Casa de PapelakaMoney Heist(6.7 billion hours viewed over its lifetime).We’re excited to expand theLCDPuniverse withour Korean adaptation,Money Heist: Korea - JointEconomic Area, launching later this year.\\nOver the years, we’ve learned that big hits can come from anywhere in the world (with great subtitlesand dubbing), as we’ve seen withLa Casa de Papel,Squid Game, andLupinto name just a few. But ourgoal with non-English originals is to first and foremost thrill audiences in their home country. And in thequarter, we saw big local viewing for titles such asLove is Blind Brazil,My Namefrom Korea, superherofilmMinnal Muralifrom India and Danish thrillerThe Chestnut Man.\\nFilm is incredibly important for our members, which is why our ambition has always been to work withthe world’s best filmmakers and stars to create a wide variety of quality movies. We took a large stepforward in Q4 on this front with our biggest film slate ever. Our blockbusterRed Notice(starring DwayneJohnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds) quickly became our most popular movie launch of all-time with364 million hours viewed in its first four weeks. Other hits this quarter includeThe Unforgivable,starring\\n2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with anasterisk), data is from launch date through January 18, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles basedon hours viewed atNetflix Top 10.\\n4\\nSandra Bullock (215m hours viewed),Army of the DeadprequelArmy of Thieves(158m hours viewed),feel-good holiday romcomLove Hardwith Jimmy O. Yangand Nina Dobrev (134m hours viewed),animated featureBack to the Outback(105m hours viewed)andThe Harder They Fall(122m hoursviewed). On Christmas Eve, we released the star-studded satireDon’t Look Up(featuring LeonardoDiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep),which is already our second most popular film ever with 353m* hours viewed.\\nOverall in 2021, Netflix series accounted for six out of the 10 most searched shows globally while ourfilms represented two of the top 10.\\nGoogle Year in Search, 2021 (Global)\\nSour ce: Google.\\nIn November we debuted our mobile games experience globally on Android and iOS. Members can nowdiscover and launch games from within the Netflix mobile app. Since launch, we released an additionalfive games, bringing the total to ten for 2021. It’s still very early days but we’re pleased with ourprogress. In 2022, we’ll expand our portfolio of games across both casual and core gaming genres as wecontinue to program a breadth of game types to learn what our members enjoy most.\\nMark eting & Communic ations\\nOne of our goals with marketing is to help drive conversation about and passion for our titles. We knowthat Netflix fans want to dive deeper into what they watch with behind-the-scenes details, interviews,and updates. To make it easier and more engaging for our fans, we’ve launched the siteTudum(namedafter our “sonic logo”) as a home for extending stories and conversation and further building fandom forour TV shows and films.\\nProduct & Pricing\\nNetflix offers a wide variety of TV shows and films to its members, which we know they value. We alsowork hard to make it easy for members to access this content. For instance, in October, we introducedvoice-driven Play Something, first on Amazon Fire TV devices (TVs, sticks, and set top boxes). Now,members can simply say “Play Something on Netflix” or “Play a movie on Netflix” and playback will start\\n5\\nregardless of whether you are browsing Netflix or another service. If they don’t like what’s playing,simply saying “play something else” or “next” will play the next title in the list. Voice-driven PlaySomething makes choosing effectively effortless.\\nIn December, welowered our pricesin India acrossall four plans. India is fairly unique because pay TVpricing is very low. We believe these new prices will make Netflix more accessible to a broader swath ofthe population - strengthening our value perception. Our goal is to maximize long term revenue in eachof our markets.\\nCompe tition\\nConsumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time - competition thathas only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world developtheir own streaming offering. While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth some,we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives havelaunched. This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition fromlinear to streaming and that with under 10% of total TV screen time in the US, our biggest market, Netflixhas tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$403 million vs. -$138 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)for the quarter was-$569 million vs. -$284 million in Q4‘20. For the full year3\\n2021, FCF amounted to -$159 million, in-line with our expectation for “approximately break-even.”\\nWe didn’t engage in share repurchases in Q4 as we funded our acquisition of the Roald Dahl StoryCompany from cash on hand during the quarter.\\nWe anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, weprioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming,followed by selective acquisitions. We’re also targeting $10-$15 billion of gross debt. We finished Q4with gross debt of $15.5 billion and we’ll pay down $700 million of our senior notes due in Q1’22. Aftersatisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above our minimum cash levels will be returned toshareholders via stock repurchases.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nWhile our current governance structure has served our shareholders extraordinarily well with asustained period of substantial growth, we’ve clearly proven our business model: streaming is now anestablished business, we’re self-funding and expect sustained positive free cash flow, and we’vesubstantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margin. So the Netflix Board has decided toevolve to a more standard large-cap governance structure and will recommend several changes at our\\n3\\nFor a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes \\nthereto.\\n6\\nnext annual meeting. These include declassifying our board, removing supermajority voting provisions inour charter and bylaws, and enabling shareholders to call special meetings. We will also change thevoting standard for our directors in uncontested elections.\\nLong T erm St ock Price P erformance\\nIn each January investor letter, we provide an update on our long term stock performance. We continueto manage our business for the long term and under the belief that pleasing our members will lead tostrong value creation for our fellow shareholders.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures,during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, makestrategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However,this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superiorto, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in)operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Paid net adds totaled 6.8m compared to our 7.0m forecast and prior year Q3 of 6.1m. As\\n \\nwe’ve improved the variety, diversity and quality of our content slate, member engagement has grown,\\n \\nrevenue has increased, and we’re able to further fund our content investment.\\n \\n \\n \\nQ3 Results and Q4 Forecast\\n \\nIn Q3’19, average streaming paid memberships and ARPU grew 22% and 9% year over year, respectively.\\n \\nExcluding a -$137m year over year impact from F/X, consolidated revenue growth was 35%, while\\n \\nstreaming ARPU growth was 12%. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above our\\n \\nguidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4’19. EPS\\n \\namounted to $1.47 vs. $0.89 and included a $171 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X\\n \\nremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Our Euro bonds provide us with a small natural hedge\\n \\nfor our growing European revenues.\\n \\n \\nTotal paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. As a reminder,\\n \\nthe quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for\\n \\naccuracy. In Q3, our guidance forecast was our most accurate in recent history.\\n \\n1\\n \\n \\n \\nIn the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are\\n \\n2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention\\n \\nhas not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US\\n \\nmembership growth. On a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a\\n \\nmeaningful impact on paid net adds. However, revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU\\n \\nincreased 16.5% year over year in Q3. With more revenue, we’ll continue to invest to improve our\\n \\nservice to further strengthen our value proposition.\\n \\nInternational paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and\\n \\nslightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over\\n \\nthe course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international\\n \\nrevenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We’re making strides\\n \\nin our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing\\n \\nencouraging signs of progress.\\n \\n \\nFor Q4, we’re expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU\\n \\ngrowth. We’re forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for\\n \\nthe international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last\\n \\nyear. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast\\n \\nreflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content\\n \\nslate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor\\n \\nelevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. As we outline in\\n \\nmore detail below, our long term outlook on our business is unchanged.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n \\n \\nWe’re on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we’ll be targeting\\n \\nanother 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin\\n \\nimprovement we’ve delivered each year since 2017. As we’ve said previously, large swings in F/X could\\n \\nlead to some variations from our steady annual margin progression, partially because we don’t buy\\n \\nderivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars.\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nWe strive to program Netflix with the best variety of high quality content across many genres (scripted\\n \\nseries, films, docs, comedy specials, unscripted TV, kids & family, anime, etc.). Our ambitious approach\\n \\nreflects our goal to satisfy the entertainment desires of our 158m-plus members and to attract as many\\n \\nof the hundreds of millions of non-members as we can. To accomplish this, we need great breadth of\\n \\nquality content because people have very diverse tastes.\\n \\n \\nIf you think about your own habits, you’ll recognize that what you want to watch on a Friday night may\\n \\ndiffer from what you want to watch on Tuesday after a long day of work or what you want to watch with\\n \\nyour family on Saturday morning or what you want to watch with your friends on Sunday afternoon.\\n \\nNow, multiply that by the billions of people on the planet and all the other factors that affect viewing\\n \\npreferences and you will have a sense of the breadth of programming necessary to be as successful as\\n \\nwe desire.\\n \\n \\nWe have been moving increasingly to original content both because of the anticipated pullback of\\n \\nsecond run content from some studios and because our original content is working in the form of\\n \\nmember viewing and engagement. We started first with English scripted TV series more than six years\\n \\nago to great success. We continued in Q3 with \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n Season 3 (the most watched season to\\n \\ndate with 64m member households in its first four weeks). We also introduced new limited series like\\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nUnbelievable\\n\\u200b\\n, one of our most thought provoking and highly viewed dramas (watched by 32m member\\n \\nhouseholds in its first 28 days).\\n \\nWe’re expanding our non-English language original offerings because they continue to help grow our\\n \\npenetration in international markets. In Q3, Season 3 of\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel\\n\\u200b\\n (aka \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n) became the\\n \\nmost watched show on Netflix across our non-English language territories with 44m households\\n \\nwatching the new season in the first four weeks of release. \\n\\u200b\\nSintonia\\n\\u200b\\n, our latest Brazilian original, was the\\n \\nsecond most watched inaugural season in Brazil. \\n\\u200b\\nThe Naked Director\\n\\u200b\\n broke out as the biggest title launch\\n \\nfor us in Japan and was also highly successful throughout Asia. Similarly, in India, we debuted the second\\n \\nseason of \\n\\u200b\\nSacred Games\\n\\u200b\\n, our most watched show in India. To date, we have globally released 100\\n \\nseasons of local language, original scripted series from 17 countries and have plans for over 130 more in\\n \\n2020. We also plan to expand our investment in local language original films and unscripted series.\\n \\n \\nWe’re also investing aggressively in original films and making great progress with improving results. Our\\n \\noriginal film slate in Q3 featured several solid hits like \\n\\u200b\\nSecret Obsession\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Brenda Song) and\\n \\nOtherhood\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by Cindy Chupack in her feature directorial debut), which were  watched by 40\\n \\nmillion and 29 million households in their first four weeks, respectively. \\n\\u200b\\nTall Girl\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n\\u200b\\n a new family film\\n \\nstarring Ava Michelle, was also a success with 41m households watching in the first 28 days. We expect\\n \\nthat our Q4 film releases will continue to build and strengthen our film effort. Q4 film releases include\\n \\nMartin Scorsese’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Irishman\\n\\u200b\\n (with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci), \\n\\u200b\\nMarriage Story\\n\\u200b\\n (starring\\n \\nScarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Two Popes\\n\\u200b\\n (featuring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan\\n \\nPryce), all of which have emerged as early Oscar frontrunners. We also have several big releases such as\\n \\nDolemite is My Name\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Eddie Murphy and featuring a breakout performance from \\n\\u200b\\nDa'Vine Joy\\n \\nRandolph\\n\\u200b\\n), \\n\\u200b\\n6 Underground\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds), \\n\\u200b\\nThe Laundromat\\n\\u200b\\n, from\\n \\ndirector Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman and\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nThe King\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\n(starring \\n\\u200b\\nTimothée\\n \\nChalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton) as well as animated features\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nKlaus\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nI Lost My Body\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\nOur goal is to have the quality of our slate rival the ambition of its scope. An example is \\n\\u200b\\nOrange is the\\n \\nNew Black\\n\\u200b\\n, which wrapped its final new season in Q3. The show was celebrated by fans and the media\\n \\nfor the groundbreaking role it played for Netflix and the culture at large; Time Magazine said\\n \\n \\n“...’Orange is the New Black’ is the most important TV show of the decade.”\\n\\u200b\\n  Our very popular \\n\\u200b\\nOzark,\\n \\nOur Planet, Queer Eye, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nWhen They See Us\\n\\u200b\\n led 40 Netflix original series\\n \\nand films to a record 117 Emmy Nominations and 27 wins in 2019.\\n \\nWith so many firms now looking to provide premium video content to consumers, it’s a great time to be\\n \\na creator of content. Amazing content can be expensive. We don’t shy away from taking bold swings if\\n \\nwe think the business impact will also be amazing. We don’t close every deal we chase and we don’t\\n \\nchase every deal on the table. And while not all projects that we do pursue will work out, our large and\\n \\ngrowing subscription base helps enable us to try many approaches, while the size of our content budget\\n \\n(~$10 billion on P&L spend and ~$15 billion in cash content spend in 2019) insulates us from\\n \\ndependency on any single title. We’ll continue to learn as we go, while staying disciplined by assessing\\n \\neach opportunity individually, steadily marching up our operating margin and improving free cash flow.\\n \\n \\n \\n4\\n \\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe seek to make it easier for future members to sign up and enjoy Netflix. To that end, we rolled out a\\n \\nlower priced mobile plan in India in July and we’re pleased with the results. Our approach with pricing is\\n \\nto grow revenue and so far, uptake and retention on our mobile plan in India has been better than our\\n \\ninitial testing suggested. This will allow us to invest more in Indian content to further satisfy our\\n \\nmembers. While still only a very small percentage of our total subscriber base, we’re continuing to test\\n \\nmobile-only plans in other markets.\\n \\n \\nWe continued to expand our partner-based bundle offerings, adding bundles with Sky Italia, Canal+ in\\n \\nFrance, KDDI in Japan and Izzi in Mexico this quarter. We just localized our service in Vietnamese,\\n \\nHungarian and Czech so that more entertainment fans can enjoy thousands of hours of TV shows and\\n \\nfilms in their preferred language. We’ll continue to expand language coverage and accessibility.\\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nWe compete broadly for entertainment time. This means there are many competitive activities to Netflix\\n \\n(from watching linear TV to playing video games, for example). But there is also a very large market\\n \\nopportunity; today we believe we’re less than 10% of TV screen time in the US (our most mature\\n \\nmarket) and much less than that in mobile screen time. Many are focused on the “streaming wars,” but\\n \\nwe’ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade.\\n \\nThe upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased\\n \\ncompetition, but we are all small compared to linear TV. While the new competitors have some great\\n \\ntitles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming\\n \\nthat we are producing around the world.\\n \\n \\nThe launch of these new services will be noisy. There may be some modest headwind to our near-term\\n \\ngrowth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we’ll\\n \\ncontinue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. By way of\\n \\nexample, our growth in Canada, where Hulu does not exist, is nearly identical to our growth in the US\\n \\n(where Hulu is very successful at about 30 million paid memberships). Our penetration in both markets\\n \\nbelow:\\n \\n5\\n \\n \\n \\nWe believe this is due to the big factor of streaming growing into linear TV plus the fact that streaming\\n \\nvideo services have mostly exclusive content libraries that make them highly differentiated from one\\n \\nanother. In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the\\n \\nshift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast\\n \\nTV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for\\n \\nmany players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and\\n \\nDiscovery didn’t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience\\n \\nshare from broadcast viewing.\\n \\n \\nContent creation is booming around the world and everyone is vying for consumer attention. Over the\\n \\nnext 10 years, many streaming services will grow viewing as streaming replaces linear TV. Our focus will\\n \\ncontinue to be on pleasing our members and growing engagement because that approach has served us\\n \\nwell since 1997. Total viewing, as measured by various 3rd parties, is the best indicator of our relative\\n \\nsuccess since it’s a signal of customer satisfaction, and few of the services will disclose streaming video\\n \\nrevenue, and subscriber figures are hard to interpret (given bundles, discounts and other promotions).\\n \\nOur focused approach to date has driven meaningful growth in our membership base and engagement.\\n \\n \\nWe did well during the first decade of streaming. We’ve been preparing for this new wave of\\n \\ncompetition for a long time. It’s why we started investing in originals in 2012 and expanded aggressively\\n \\never since - across programming categories and countries with an ambition to share stories from the\\n \\nworld to the world. In Q4, with \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nKlaus\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Irishman\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Two Popes\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\n6\\n \\nUnderground\\n\\u200b\\n, and many other amazing titles launching, we’re ready to compete to earn consumers’\\n \\nattention and viewing.\\n \\n \\n \\n6\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash used in operating activities in Q3’19 was -$502 million vs. -$690 million in the prior year period.\\n \\nFree cash flow\\n in Q3 totaled -$551 million vs. -$859 million in Q3’18. For the full year 2019, we’re still\\n \\n1\\nexpecting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding\\n \\noperating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we’re\\n \\nexpecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually\\n \\nbeyond 2020. As we move slowly toward FCF positive, our plan is to continue to use the high yield\\n \\nmarket in the interim to finance our investment needs.\\n \\n \\nNext Year Reporting\\n \\nStarting with our Q4’19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership\\n \\nby region, which is how we think about our business. Our four regions are Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe,\\n \\nMiddle East & Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM), and the US and Canada (UCAN). UCAN is roughly\\n \\n90% US and 10% Canada.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are\\n \\nimportant liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated\\n \\n8\\n \\n \\nthat is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the\\n \\namount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of\\n \\nthese non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial\\n \\nstatements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding pricing; investments in our service; future content\\n \\nofferings and approach to accessing content; investment in local language original films and unscripted\\n \\nseries; evolution of streaming video services; product tests and changes; impact of and reaction to\\n \\ncompetition; future capital raises; U.S. and international streaming paid memberships, paid net\\n \\nadditions, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin; consolidated revenue, revenue\\n \\ngrowth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; free cash flow; and\\n \\nchanges to earnings reports.

Our existing plans remain ad free.\\n●Netflix has higher engagement than any other streamer – with room for growth:\\n○In the UK, Netflix accounts for 8.2% of video viewing, 2.3x Amazon and 2.7x Disney+;1\\n○In the US, Netflix accounts for 7.6% of TV time, 2.6x Amazon and 1.4x Disney + Hulu +Hulu Live.2\\n●Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large,successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix\\'s $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit.\\nAfter a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth. The key is pleasingmembers. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When ourseries and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and staywith us.\\n2Based onNielsen’s Gauge, as of August 20221Based on reporting fromBARB, as of September 2022\\n1\\nQ3 R esults\\nOur 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 5% increase in average paid membershipsand a 1% rise in ARM. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), revenue and ARM grew 13% and3\\n8% year-over-year, respectively. The sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to F/X. Weunder-forecasted paid net additions, which totaled 2.4 million vs. our 1.0m forecast and compared to4.4m in the year ago quarter.\\n●In APAC, revenue grew 19% excluding F/X as average paid memberships rose 23% year-over-year.ARM was -3% year-over-year, excluding F/X, partially driven by lower ARM in India, somewhatoffset by higher ARM in Australia and Korea. We added 1.4m paid memberships in the region (vs.2.2m last Q3).\\n●Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM grew 13% and 7%, respectively. Paid net adds totaled0.6m vs. 1.8m in the year ago quarter.\\n●In LATAM, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, supported by ARM growth of 16% vs. the yearago quarter excluding F/X. We added 0.3m paid memberships, in-line with membership growthin Q3’21.\\n●In UCAN, our most penetrated market, ARM and revenue grew by 12% and 11%, respectively,excluding F/X. Paid net adds totaled 0.1m (similar to the 0.1m in Q3’21).\\nFor Q3, operating income totaled $1.5 billion vs. $1.8 billion in Q3’21. Operating income was above ourbeginning-of-quarter forecast, partially due to higher revenue, as well as a shift in timing of some spendfrom Q3 to Q4. As a result, operating margin of 19% was above our 16% forecast. The four percentagepoint year-over-year decline in operating margin is almost entirely due to the appreciation in the USdollar vs. most other currencies during this period. EPS of $3.10 vs. $3.19 a year ago included a $348million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\nQ4 F orecast\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.The appreciation of the US dollar remains a significant headwind for us (and US-based multinationals ingeneral). For Q4’22, we’re expecting revenue of $7.8 billion with the sequential decline entirely due tothe continued strengthening of the US dollar vs. other currencies. On a constant currency basis, thisequates to 9% year-over-year revenue growth.\\nOur revenue growth forecast is driven by our expectation for 4.5m paid net adds (vs. 8.3m in Q4’21) andARM growth of 6% year-over-year, excluding F/X. Our paid net adds forecast assumes that we experienceour usual seasonality as well as the impact of a strong content slate, counterbalanced by macroeconomicweakness which leads to less-than-normal visibility. While we’re very optimistic about our newadvertising business, we don’t expect a material contribution in Q4’22 as we’re launching our Basic withAds plan intra-quarter and anticipate growing our membership in that plan gradually over time. Our aim\\n3ARM\\n(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n2\\nis to give our prospective new members more choice - not switch members off their current plans.Members who don’t want to change will remain on their current plan, without ads, at the current price.\\nWe forecast Q4’22 operating margin of 4% vs. 8% in the year ago period. The fourth quarter is typicallyour lowest operating margin quarter of the year as it’s usually our largest quarter in terms of content andmarketing spend. In addition, the aforementioned F/X impact has a high flow through to operatingincome (~75%-80% of the revenue impact) as most of our costs are in US dollars. Excluding theyear-over-year impact of F/X, our Q4’22 operating margin forecast would be 10% vs. 8% in Q4’21.\\nTheUS dollar has strengthenedagainst most othercurrencies at a historic rate this year. Based on ourYTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negativelyimpact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively.\\nAs a reminder, our 2022 and 2023 operating margin target of 19%-20% is based on F/X rates in January2022, as we discussed in ourQ4’21 letterand subsequentearnings calls. We’re on track to meet this F/Xneutral operating margin objective for 2022 (excluding the $150m of restructuring costs in Q2) and for2023. With the appreciation of the US dollar though, our reported operating margin would be lower than19%-20% should the US dollar remain above January 2022 levels relative to other currencies.\\nOver the medium term, we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollarworld. Our long term goal remains unchanged - to sustain double digit revenue growth, increaseoperating profit even faster (as we expand margins) and deliver growing positive free cash flow.\\nGuidanc e EvolutionAs discussed in previous letters, we are increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top line metric.This will become particularly important heading into 2023 as we develop new revenue streams likeadvertising and paid sharing, where membership is just one component of our revenue growth. So,\\n3\\nstarting with our Q4’22 letter in January of 2023, we’ll continue to provide guidance for revenue,operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and fully diluted shares outstanding for thefollowing quarter, but not paid membership. Similar to our regional membership disclosure, we’llcontinue to report our global and regional membership each quarter as part of our earnings release.\\nContent & Mark eting\\nWe started our original programming strategy about a decade ago as we anticipated that somecompetitors would eventually stop licensing their content to Netflix. It’s been a huge challenge to build alifetime of entertainment in just ten years in multiple languages and across so many different genres\\n-series, films, animation, stand-up and non-fiction. And while we’ve had our share of misses, we’vemanaged to create a very broad slate with many great series and films, for whatever your mood ortastes, from amazing storytellers around the world. Given everything we’ve learned, we’re confident wecan deliver even more member value per content investment dollar over time.\\nOne of the best ways to understand the success of our content is by understanding our engagement. Sowe’re excited that BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board), the leading audience measurementand video ratings organization in the UK, is now reporting the share of video viewing for streamingservices and broadcast groups in the UK on a monthly basis. In September, Netflix accounted for 8.2% ofviewing, and we have more than 2x the monthly engagement of our next closest streaming competitor.This reporting is similar to Nielsen’s Gauge, which launched in May 2021 when Netflix accounted for 6%of viewing compared to 7.6% in August 2022. Our hope is that other measurement companies aroundthe world will join Nielsen and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming and theviewing share of relevant entertainment companies.\\nWe think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles.This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love. As theGoogle Trends chartshows, theability to watch all ofMonster: The Jeffrey DahmerStoryhelped drive significant interest in the show.\\n4\\nIt’s hard to imagine, for example, how a Korean title likeSquid Gamewould have become a mega hitglobally without the momentum that came from people being able to binge it. We believe the ability forour members to immerse themselves in a story from start to finish increases their enjoyment but alsotheir likelihood to tell their friends, which then means more people watch, join and stay with Netflix.\\nOur Q3 content slate was especially strong. In English scripted TV, we kicked off the quarter withStranger ThingsS4, which generated 1.35 billion hoursviewed- our biggest season of an English4\\nlanguage series ever. This was followed in August byThe Sandman(351 million hours viewed), which wasloved by fans and critics alike. Near the end of the quarter, we launched season five of fan favoriteCobraKai(270 million hours viewed) and limited seriesMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story*(824 million hoursviewed) from Ryan Murphy, which is now our second largest English series.\\nWe continue to see great success with our non-English programming too, withSquid Gamemakingawards history by becoming the first foreign language title to win an Emmy - withsix awards, includingfor directing, production design and lead actor. Also from Korea,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, a uniqueseries about an autistic lawyer, has reached #1 on our weekly non-English series list in 28 countries,notching up 402 million hours viewed and making it our sixth largest non-English TV show ever through28 days.Narco-Saintshas been another huge K-Contentwin this quarter, with 128 million hours viewedsince launch.Sintoniahas been a big hit for Netflixin Brazil, with season three generating 38 millionhours viewed. And while it is still early days for German seriesThe Empress*, it launched with a verystrong start (136 million hours viewed). Our goal is to create authentic local stories for members in thehome territory, which we also make available globally.\\nFilm is incredibly important to our members. We expanded into original film in 2016 because producingour own movies across all budgets and genres has advantages over the next best alternative: onlylicensing from other studios in the first pay TV window (the “pay-one” window). Those advantagesinclude first window availability on Netflix (pay-one movies debut generally well after theatrical release),global rights (pay-one movies are licensed by country), the ability to carry the films on Netflix inperpetuity (typically only for 18-24 months for pay-one films) and copyright ownership, enabling us tocreate derivatives like sequels and to use the intellectual property (IP) in games and consumer products.We continue to complement our original films with 3rd party licensed films - they remain an importantand valued part of our service, but they are just one component of our broader programming strategy.\\nWe’re pleased with the progress of our original film initiative. The big budget action filmThe Gray Man(254 million hours viewed) reflects the scope of our ambition to create theatrical quality blockbustersthat can reach huge audiences on Netflix: 118 million households (many of which are multi person) ifyou divide the total hours viewed by the film’s run time of 2 hours and 9 minutes. But since we’re notlimited by the need to optimize for theatrical attendance, we can also produce a wider variety of filmsthat consumers can enjoy. For example, the romantic dramaPurple Heartswas a hit among ourmembers with 229 million  hours viewed. We’re at an even earlier stage with animated feature films butin early Q3 we releasedThe Sea Beast(165 millionhours viewed), which is our biggest original animated\\n4Hours viewed data is based on viewing in the first 28 days of release for each episode. For titles released less than28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through October 16, 2022. We publish weekly our toptitles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10, whereyou can also find our detailed methodology.\\n5\\nfilm to date. On the non-English language film side,Darlings(33 million hours viewed), starring AliaBhatt, launched to rave reviews and huge fandom in India.Loving Adults(67 million hours viewed), apsychological thriller from Denmark, andCarter(65million hours viewed), a Korean blockbuster, wereour two biggest non-English films of the quarter and are now our seventh and ninth most popularnon-English films ever.\\nWe also continue to invest heavily in marketing, with a particular focus on innovative ways to driveconversation around our titles, which in turn boosts engagement for Netflix. For example, our campaigns forStranger ThingsS4 andThe Gray Mandrove more than9.8 billion and 1.2 billion impressions, respectively,across paid marketing, social media platforms and events. And content forTudum, our global fan eventthatran for its second year in September, generated almost1 billion views- up over 30% from last year.\\nBeyond TV and movies, we’re coming up on the one year anniversary of our gaming launch. As we’vesaid, this will be a multi-year journey for us to learn how to please game players. Our first year was aboutestablishing our gaming infrastructure and understanding how our members interact with games. Wenow have 35 games on service (all included in every Netflix subscription without in-game ads or in-apppurchases) and we’re seeing some encouraging signs of gameplay leading to higher retention.\\nWith 55 more games in development, including more games based on Netflix IP, we’re focused in thenext few years on creating hit games that will take our game initiative to the next level. More generally,we see a big opportunity around content that crosses between TV or film and games. For example, afterthe launch of the animeCyberpunk: Edgerunners(49million hours viewed) in Q3use of CD Projekt’sgame surgedon PCs.\\nProduct and Pricing\\nAs we’ve been discussing over the past few quarters, improving our pricing strategy is an importantnear-term focus. Last week, weannouncedthat we’llbe launching an ad-supported subscription plan onNovember 1 in Canada and Mexico; November 3 in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea,the UK, and the US; and November 10 in Spain. Cumulatively, these 12 markets account for ~$140 billionof brand advertising spend across TV and streaming, or over 75% of the global market.5\\nTo start, we’re keeping it simple by offering one low-priced ad plan – Basic with Ads – at a price that’s20%-40% below our current starting price. So in the US, for example, Netflix will now start at $6.99 permonth (compared to $9.99 today). The Basic with Ads plan will have ~5 minutes of advertising per hour,frequency capping and strong privacy protections.\\nThe reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice,especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue andoperating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plansad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue.\\nFinally, we’ve landed on a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing and we’ll begin rolling thisout more broadly starting in early 2023. After listening to consumer feedback, we are going to offer the\\n5Excluding China and Russia, where we don’t operate.\\n6\\nability for borrowers to transfer their Netflix profile into their own account, and for sharers to managetheir devices more easily and to create sub-accounts (“extra member”), if they want to pay for family orfriends. In countries with our lower-priced ad-supported plan, we expect the profile transfer option forborrowers to be especially popular.\\nCompe tition\\nAs we’ve long said, we operate in a highly competitive industry, where people have many differententertainment choices – from linear TV to streaming, YouTube to TikTok and gaming to social media. Thesilver lining is that the opportunity is very large and growing, and Netflix is still very small relative to thatopportunity (for example, ~8% of total TV time in the US and the UK, two of our most establishedcountries). In the 190 countries in which we operate, our $30 billion-plus of annual revenue is roughly5% of the combined estimated ~$300 billion pay TV/streaming industry, ~$180 billion brandedadvertising market, and $130 billion consumers spend annually on gaming. So, we believe that we have6\\na long runway for growth if we can continue to improve our offering steadily over time.\\nAs it’s become clear that streaming is the future of entertainment, our competitors – including mediacompanies and tech players – are investing billions of dollars to scale their new services. But it\\'s hard tobuild a large and profitable streaming business – our best estimate is that all of these competitors arelosing money on streaming, with aggregate annual direct operating losses this year alone that could bewell in excess of $10 billion, compared with our +$5-$6 billion of annual operating profit. For incumbententertainment companies, this high level of investment is understandable given the accelerating declineof linear TV, which currently generates the bulk of their profit.\\nUltimately though, we believe some of our competitors will seek to build sustainable, profitablebusinesses in streaming - either on their own or through continued industry consolidation. While it’searly days, we’re starting to see this increased profit focus - with some raising prices for their streamingservices, some reigning in content spending, and some retrenching around traditional operating modelswhich may dilute their direct-to-consumer offering. Amidst this formidable, diverse set of competitors,we believe our focus as a pure-play streaming business is an advantage. Our aim remains to be the firstchoice in entertainment, and to continue to build an amazingly successful and profitable business.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $557 million vs. $82 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)amounted to $472 million,compared with -$106 million in Q3’21. We7\\ncontinue to expect FCF of +$1 billion for the full year 2022, plus or minus a few hundred million dollarsand substantial growth in FCF in 2023 (assuming no further material appreciation of the US dollar) .\\nGross debt at quarter end was $14 billion, within our $10-$15 billion target range. Cash increased $300million sequentially to $6.1 billion. Net debt amounted to $7.9 billion at the end of Q3’22, or 1.2x LTM\\n7For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to thereconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n6Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimatesand excludes China and Russia.

Our first priority is to continue to investappropriately in our business for the long term, including new initiatives such as games and advertising,followed by selective acquisitions.

We believe we have a clear path toreaccelerate our revenue growth: continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix, launching paid sharing andbuilding our ads offering. As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building evengreater profitability over time.\\n1As defined by cumulative view hours in the first 28 days\\n1\\nTed Sar andos and Gr eg P eters as our c o-CE Os\\nTo complete our succession process, Reed Hastings has become Executive Chairman, and Greg Peters hasstepped up from COO to become Ted Sarandos’ co-CEO, and a member of the Netflix board. Reed, Greg,and Ted have been working closely together for 15 years, and this makes formal externally how we havebeen operating internally. More details are here on ourblog.\\nTed said: “I want to thank Reed for his visionary leadership, mentorship and friendship over the last 20years. We’ve all learned so much from his intellectual rigor, honesty and willingness to take big bets –and we look forward to working with him for many more years to come. Since Reed started to delegatemanagement to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values andlike-minded approach to growth. I am so excited to start this new chapter with Greg as co-CEO.”\\nGreg said: \"I feel humbled and privileged to become co-CEO of Netflix. Ted and I have worked togetherfor many years – building tremendous trust and respect for each other. We\\'re also motivated by thesame goal: a desire to better serve our members so that we can continue to grow our business.”\\nIn addition to these changes, Bela Bajaria, formerly Head of Global TV, has become Chief Content Officerand Scott Stuber has become Chairman of Netflix Film. Ted said: “Bela and Scott are outstanding creativeexecutives with proven track records at Netflix. In 2022 we premiered many of our most popular seriesand films in Netflix history, including Wednesday, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Purple Hearts,Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, The Adam Project and Harry & Meghan – a testament to theirleadership and creativity. I couldn’t be more excited to work alongside them as we seek to delightaudiences for years to come.”\\nFor full details of Netflix leadership seehere.\\nQ4 R esults\\nYear over year revenue growth of 2% in Q4 (10% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis) was driven2\\nby a 4% increase in average paid memberships. ARMdeclined 2% year over year, but grew 5% on a F/X3\\nneutral basis2. Revenue was slightly above our beginning-of-quarterprojection, as paid net adds of 7.7M(vs. 8.3M in Q4’21) came in higher than our 4.5M forecast, due to both strong acquisition and retention,driven primarily by the success of our Q4 content slate. In addition, the US dollar depreciated vs. mostother currencies during the quarter, which resulted in slightly higher than projected ARM.\\nOperating income of $550M in Q4 was down vs. $632M in Q4 ‘21. This was above our guidance forecastof $330M primarily due to higher than expected revenue as well as slower-than-forecasted hiring.Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 7% compared to 8% in Q4’21. This year over year decline was dueto the appreciation of the US dollar. For the full year 2022, our operating margin amounted to 18% vs.\\n3ARM\\n(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n2Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchangerate movements. Assumes foreign exchange ratesremained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period.\\n2\\n21% in FY21. Based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022 and excluding the $150M in restructuringcharges in Q2’22, this translates into an operating margin of 20%, at the high end of the 19%-20% targetwe set inJanuary of 2022.\\nF/X Neutral Operating Margin (Excluding Restructuring Charges in Q2 2022)\\n* Based on F /X rates at the beginning of each y ear (and e xcluding the $150M of r estructuring c osts in Q2 2022). Not e: Ex cludesF/X impact on c ontent amortiz ation, as titles ar e amortiz ed a t a his torical blended r ate based on timing of spend.\\nEPS in Q4’22 was $0.12 vs. $1.33 in Q4‘21. This was below our $0.36 forecast due to a $462M non-cashunrealized loss from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt as a result of thedepreciation of the US dollar vs. the Euro during Q4’22. As a reminder, our approximately $5B of Eurobonds provides us with some natural hedge on the relative value of the Euro for net income. However, itdoesn’t affect operating income as unrealized gains or losses are recognized below operating income in“interest and other income.” For the full year, we recognized a non-cash unrealized gain of $353M fromthe F/X remeasurement on our Euro bonds.\\nForecast\\nAs we noted in our Q3’22 shareholder letter, revenue is our primary top line metric, particularly as wedevelop additional revenue streams where membership is just one component of our growth (likeadvertising and paid sharing). The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at thetime we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the rollout of major new initiatives (paidsharing and ads) plus current uncertain macroeconomic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility.\\nWe forecast Q1’23 revenue growth of 4% (8% on a F/X neutral basis). We expect our F/X neutral revenuegrowth to be driven by a combination of year over year growth in average paid memberships and ARM.This translates into modest positive paid net adds in Q1 ‘23 (vs. paid net adds of -0.2M in Q1’22). Our\\n3\\nexpectation of fewer paid net adds in Q1’23 vs. Q4’22 is consistent with normal seasonality and factorsin our strong member growth in Q4’22, which likely pulled forward some growth from Q1’23.\\nIn addition, we expect to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1’23 (more details below in theProduct and Pricing section). We anticipate that this will result in a very different quarterly paid net addspattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2’23 than in Q1’23. From our experience inLatin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing, whichimpacts near term member growth. But as borrower households begin to activate their own standaloneaccounts and extra member accounts are added, we expect to see improved overall revenue, which isour goal with all plan and pricing changes.\\nOur long term financial objectives remain unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expandoperating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. For the full year 2023, as we continue toimprove our service, grow our advertising business and launch paid sharing, we expect constant currencyrevenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. We also expect year over year operating profitgrowth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F/X).\\nWe have been targeting a FY23 operating margin of 19%-20% based on F/X rates at the beginning of2022. We now expect to deliver roughly 21%-22% operating margin on this basis (above the 19%-20%range). Rolling forward to F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, this translates into a FY23 operating margintarget of 18%-20%. For Q1’23, we expect operating margin to be down year over year (20% vs. 25%) dueprimarily to the timing of content spend.\\nContent and Mark eting\\nPeople have more choice of films and TV shows than ever so we need to ensure that there’s alwayssomething great for them to watch on Netflix, regardless of their taste, mood, or who they’re watchingwith. It’s why we’re so focused on continuing to improve our content and broaden our slate. 2022\\'ssuccessful slate was the result of having the best creative executives working with best in class creators.Last year alone we launched:4\\n●Five of our Top 10 most popular English language TV seasons ever –Stranger Things 4andWednesday(both of which hit 1B hours viewed), Monster:The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,BridgertonS2 andInventing Anna– as well asHarry & Meghan,our second most successful doc series ever;\\n●Four of our Top 10 most popular English language films ever–The Adam Project, The Gray Man,Purple HeartsandGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery– as well asThe Sea BeastandThe TinderSwindler, our most successful animated and documentaryfilms respectively;\\n●Seven of our Top 10 most popular non-English films ever –Troll(Norway),All Quiet on theWestern Front(Germany),Black Crab(Sweden),ThroughMy Window(Spain),The Takedown(France),My Name is Vendetta(Italy), andLovingAdults(Denmark);\\n●Two of our Top 10 most popular non-English TV shows ever–All of Us Are DeadandExtraordinary Attorney Woo, both from Korea.\\n4For View Hours for these titles, please visitNetflixTop 10.\\n4\\nWe’re also pleased with the progress we’ve made with returning titles. Members watched more Netflixreturning seasons and sequels in 2022 than ever before across a broad range of genres – from film (EnolaHolmes2,Lost Bullet2 and two365 Dayssequels) and unscripted (Selling SunsetS5 andLove is BlindS3)to award winning drama (OzarkS4 andThe CrownS5),local language series (SintoniaS3,Young RoyalsS2andAlice in BorderlandS2, whose success pushed S1back into the Top 10 after its launch) and animation(Big MouthS6).\\nIt’s hard to think of two titles that more successfully pierced the zeitgeist this year thanStranger Things4andWednesday. Both pushed old songs into the musiccharts: Kate Bush’sRunning Up That Hillwent tonumber 1 on Billboard’s Global charts for the first time, 37 years after it was first released, and LadyGaga’sBloody Marymade it onto the Billboard top40 list for the first time ever, 11 years after it was firstreleased. We get amazing results when we have aWednesday,Glass OnionorMonstermoment with ourmembers. We believe people typically sign up for a streaming service because they’ve heard about a title“you simply must watch” from a friend, seen the excitement on social media or read about it in thepress. Generating conversation is our primary marketing goal because we see that it drives acquisitionand encourages existing members to watch more, which in turn helps with retention. For Ryan Murphy’sThe Watcher, conversation about the series led tofans flocking to the house, aSaturday Night Livespoofand a spike inhome security sales. OurWednesdaycampaign, with all our marketing in Wednesday’siconic voice, generated 1.5B organic social impressionspre-launch, a record for a Netflix season one.Over time, we hope to have more and more of these moments across film and TV, and to replicate thesesuccesses on the games side.\\nIt’s now slightly over a year since we launched games on the Netflix service. We’ve madegood progressin that time - creating the infrastructure to deliver games to mobile devices, building a portfolio of 50games across many genres and acquiring four game studios to bolster our internal productioncapabilities. In Q4, we launched season four of unscripted seriesToo Hot to Handle,which was a top 10title for us globally for three consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, we debuted ourToo Hot to Handlegame, which has been our biggest game launch to date and is another encouraging sign in the long termopportunity to entertain members with Netflix intellectual property (IP) across different mediums. In2023, we’ll continue toexpand our offeringwith moregames, with a focus on Netflix-related IP.\\nProduct and Pricing\\nAs discussed over the past few quarters, we’re working to give people more choice when it comes toprice as well as greater control over their Netflix account. In November, we successfully launched ournew, lower priced ad-supported plan in 12 countries. We believe branded television advertising is asubstantial long term incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Netflix, and our ability to stand upthis business in six months underscores our commitment both to give members more choice and toreaccelerate our growth.\\nWhile it’s still early days for ads and we have lots to do (in particular better targeting and measurement),we are pleased with our progress to date across every dimension: member experience, value toadvertisers, and incremental contribution to our business. Engagement, which is consistent withmembers on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected and we believe the lower\\n5\\nprice point is driving incremental membership growth. Also, as expected, we’ve seen very little switchingfrom other plans. Overall the reaction to this launch from both consumers and advertisers has confirmedour belief that our ad-supported plan has strong unit economics (at minimum, in-line with or better thanthe comparable ad-free plan) and will generate incremental revenue and profit, though the impact on2023 will be modest given that this will build slowly over time.\\nLater in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing(100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as buildour business. While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change formembers who share their account more broadly. So we’ve worked hard to build additional new featuresthat improve the Netflix experience, including the ability for members to review which devices are usingtheir account and to transfer a profile to a new account. As we roll out paid sharing, members in manycountries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t livewith. As is the case today,allmembers will be ableto watch while traveling, whether on a TV or mobiledevice.\\nAs we work through this transition – and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don’tconvert to extra members or full paying accounts – near term engagement, as measured by third partieslike Nielsen’s The Gauge, could be negatively impacted. However, we believe the pattern will be similarto what we’ve seen in Latin America, with engagement growing over time as we continue to deliver agreat slate of programming and borrowers sign-up for their own accounts.\\nCompe tition\\nWe continue to operate in a highly competitive market as consumers have a vast number ofentertainment choices. Beyond our direct streaming competitors, we also vie for consumers’ timeagainst linear TV, YouTube, short form entertainment like TikTok, and gaming, to name just a few. Thesilver lining is that the market for entertainment is huge and Netflix is still very small by comparison. Forexample, in the more than 190 countries we operate in, our $30B+ of annual revenue compares againstthe combined annual estimated ~$300B pay TV/streaming industry, $180B branded TV advertising spendand $130 billion consumer spend on gaming.5\\nIt’s not easy to build a large and profitable streaming business. But we’re competing from a position ofstrength, as we lead the industry in terms of engagement, revenue and streaming profit. As a pure-playstreaming company, we’re also not anchored to shrinking legacy business models, like traditionalentertainment firms, allowing us to lean hard into the big growth opportunity ahead of us.\\nAs we’ve said before, beyond revenue and profitability, another way to look at our business is throughengagement, and we are pleased to have Kantar join Nielsen – who have expanded their efforts – andBARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming as well as the viewing share ofdifferent entertainment companies in Brazil, Mexico, and Poland.\\n5Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludeshardware sales.\\n6\\nAs can be seen in the newly reported markets of Mexico, Brazil, and Poland, we are less than 5% of TVviewing. And in our largest markets like the US and the UK, we are still less than 10% of TV screen time.As one of the leaders in streaming across all markets, we’re encouraged by the fact that streamingoverall accounts for less than 40% of viewing across these markets (and as little as 6% in Poland). Webelieve ultimately the vast majority of time spent on TV will happen via streaming, which should providea long runway for growth as we continue to improve our service.\\nSour ce: Nielsen (US,Mexico,Poland), Kantar (Brazil),BARB (UK).

Free cash flow (FCF)for Q4 totaled $0.3B, compared with -$0.6Bin6\\nthe year ago quarter. For FY22, we generated FCF of $1.6B (vs. -$0.2B in FY21), above our forecast ofapproximately $1B.\\nNow that we are a decade into our original programming initiative and have successfully scaled it, we arepast the most cash intensive phase of this buildout. As a result, we believe we will now be generatingsustained, positive annual free cash flow going forward. Assuming no material swings in F/X, we expectat least $3B of FCF for the full year 2023.\\nWe closed two previously announced acquisitions in Q4 - leading animation studioAnimal Logicandgames studioSpry Fox. We funded these purchases fromcash on hand.\\n6Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activitiesless purchases of property and equipment and changein other assets.\\n7\\nGross debt at quarter end totaled $14B, in-line with our targeted range of $10-$15B.

All of our debt is fixed rate.\\nOur capital structure policy is unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core businessand to fund new opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintainingminimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (e.g., about $5.2B based on Q4 revenue).After meeting those needs, we intend to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases.Assuming no material acquisitions, we anticipate resuming our share buyback program in 2023.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nTwo years ago we increased our focus on sustainability and related initiatives– building a team of8\\nexperts, announcing an ambitious environmentalcommitment,and exploring creative-friendly ways toreduce emissions in our productions (which account for more than half of our emissions as a company).As a result,Netflix production sets are becomingmore sustainablethrough cleaner technologies,including electric vehicles and clean alternatives to diesel generators.\\nIn 2021, we created theNetflix Fund for CreativeEquity, committing $100M over five years to furtherdevelop our pipeline for underrepresented talent.  Through the fund, Netflix supports externalorganizations committed to creating equitable opportunities in the TV and film industries, as well asbespoke Netflix programsthat help us to identify,train and provide job placement for emerging talentglobally.

However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as asubstitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per shareand net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared inaccordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures arecontained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. We are not able to reconcileforward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because we are unable to predict without unreasonableeffort the exact amount or timing of the reconciling items, including property and equipment and changein other assets, and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The variability of these itemscould have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\\nForward-Looking St atemen tsThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federalsecurities laws, including statements regarding our expected results for the fiscal quarterending March 31, 2023 and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023; adoption and growth of internetentertainment; growth outlook and market opportunity; competitive position; core strategy andbusiness model; content offerings; our games strategy; monetization through pricing and tieringstructures,  including paid sharing; ad-supported tier and its prospects; our competitors’ performance;account sharing; impact of foreign exchange rates; seasonality; cash spend; stock repurchases; paid netadditions, membership growth and retention; engagement; consolidated revenue, revenue and ARMgrowth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and free cash flow.The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could causeactual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members andretain existing members; our ability to compete effectively, including for consumer engagement withdifferent modes of entertainment; our ability to monetize account sharing; maintenance and expansionof device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions;production risks; macroeconomic conditions and timing of content releases.

       "  'content': 'January 21, 2020\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\nWe had a strong finish to 2019, with Q4 revenue growing 31% year over year, bringing full year 2019\\n \\nrevenue to over $20 billion, while FY19 operating income rose 62% to $2.6 billion. During the quarter,\\n \\nwe surpassed 100 million paid memberships outside of the US. Streaming entertainment is a global\\n \\nphenomenon and we’re working hard to build on our early progress.\\n \\n \\n \\nQ4 Results and Q1 Forecast\\n \\nIn Q4, average streaming paid memberships grew 21% year over year while streaming ARPU increased\\n \\n9% year over year. Excluding a -$133 million impact from foreign currency, streaming ARPU rose 12%\\n \\nyear over year. Operating income in Q4 amounted to $459m (vs. $216m last year). While this was\\n \\nslightly lower than our beginning-of-quarter forecast of $475m, we’re primarily managing by our full\\n \\nyear operating margin target, which we met (13% in FY19 vs. 10% in FY18).\\n \\n \\nEPS for Q4 amounted to $1.30 vs. $0.30 a year ago. During Q4, the US Treasury issued final regulations\\n \\non certain aspects of the 2017 US tax reform. As a result, we had over-accrued in the first three quarters\\n \\nof 2019 for tax, which was adjusted in Q4, resulting in our n\\n\\u200b\\net income being higher than operating\\n \\nincome this quarter. We paid US corporate taxes for the full year inclusive of this Q4 adjustment.\\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nGlobal paid net additions totaled 8.8m in Q4, on par with the 8.8m in the prior year period and ahead of\\n \\nour forecast of 7.6m, fueled by our broad slate of original programming and the worldwide adoption of\\n \\nstreaming video. We generated Q4-record paid net adds in each of the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions,\\n \\nwhile UCAN paid net adds totaled 0.55m (with 0.42m in the US) vs. 1.75m in the year ago quarter. Our\\n \\nlow membership growth in UCAN is probably due to our recent price changes and to US competitive\\n \\nlaunches. We have seen more muted impact from competitive launches outside the US (NL, CA, AU). As\\n \\nalways, we are working hard to improve our service to combat these factors and push net adds higher\\n \\nover time.\\n \\n \\n \\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.\\n \\nFor Q1’20, we forecast global paid net adds of 7.0m vs. 9.6m in Q1’19, which was an all-time high in\\n \\nquarterly paid net adds. Our Q1’20 forecast reflects the continued, slightly elevated churn levels we are\\n \\nseeing in the US plus an expectation for more balanced paid net adds across Q1 and Q2 this year, with\\n \\nseasonality more similar to 2018 than 2019. This is due in part to the timing of last year’s price changes\\n \\nand a strong upcoming Q2 content slate, where we’ll have some of our bigger titles like \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa De Papel\\n \\n(aka \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n) season 4.\\n \\n \\nWe’re targeting a 16% operating margin in 2020 (up 300 basis points year over year). As a reminder,\\n \\nlarge swings in foreign exchange (F/X) could lead to some temporary variations from our annual margin\\n \\nprogression, partially because we don’t spend on derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half\\n \\nof our revenue is not in US dollars.\\n \\nContent\\n \\nGreat content grows engagement among our members, which we believe drives word-of-mouth,\\n \\nimproves retention and grows paid memberships. We have many exciting releases for Q1’20 including\\n \\n2\\n \\nreturning seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nSex Education\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n\\u200b\\n Altered Carbon\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nNarcos: Mexico\\n\\u200b\\n, the Spanish series \\n\\u200b\\nElite\\n\\u200b\\n and Korean\\n \\nhistorical zombie thriller \\n\\u200b\\nKingdom,\\n\\u200b\\n as well as action film \\n\\u200b\\nSpenser Confidential\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Mark Wahlberg)\\n \\nand the movie sequel \\n\\u200b\\nTo All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You\\n\\u200b\\n. New original series include the recently\\n \\nreleased \\n\\u200b\\nMessiah\\n\\u200b\\n and the buzzy docu-series \\n\\u200b\\nKiller Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez\\n\\u200b\\n and the\\n \\nupcoming \\n\\u200b\\nI Am Not Okay with This.\\n \\nThese titles build off of a highly successful Q4 content slate, which included new seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown,\\n \\nBig Mouth\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nYou\\n\\u200b\\n and new series and films like \\n\\u200b\\nRhythm & Flow\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nAmerican Son\\n\\u200b\\n, Turkish series \\n\\u200b\\nThe Gift\\n \\nand French film \\n\\u200b\\nBanlieusards \\n\\u200b\\n(aka \\n\\u200b\\nStreet Flow\\n\\u200b\\n). The psychological thriller \\n\\u200b\\nYou\\n\\u200b\\n, which originated on US\\n \\nlinear TV with a modest audience, has evolved into a global phenomenon on Netflix; we estimate, based\\n \\non the first few weeks, 54m member households will choose to watch season 2 in its first 4 weeks. In its\\n \\nfirst four weeks, over 21m member households have chosen to watch season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n (up over\\n \\n40% from Season 2 over the same time period) and in total, over 73m households worldwide have\\n \\nchosen \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n since the series launched. \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n and the all new Season 3 cast just won the\\n \\nScreen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama series and star Olivia Colman won the Golden\\n \\nGlobe for Best Actress in a Drama Series.\\n \\n \\nDuring December, we also launched \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n, which is tracking to be \\n\\u200b\\nour biggest season one TV\\n \\nseries ever\\n\\u200b\\n. Through its first four weeks of release, 76m member households chose to watch this\\n \\naction-packed fantasy, starring Henry Cavill. As a testament to how our hit content can penetrate the\\n \\nglobal zeitgeist and influence popular culture, the show’s launch drove up sales of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nbooks\\n \\nand \\n\\u200b\\ngames\\n\\u200b\\n around the world, and spawned a viral musical \\n\\u200b\\nhit\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nOur Q4 movie slate set a new bar for the variety and high quality of films we produce to appeal to our\\n \\nmembers’ many different tastes. We released \\n\\u200b\\n6 Underground\\n\\u200b\\n, from director Michael Bay and starring\\n \\nRyan Reynolds, and 83m member households chose this crowd-pleasing action film through its first four\\n \\nweeks. The exceptional breadth and quality of our film slate was recognized as we led all studios with 24\\n \\nAcademy Award nominations across eight different films. The nominated feature films produced by the\\n \\nNetflix studio like \\n\\u200b\\nThe Irishman\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nMarriage Story\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Two Popes \\n\\u200b\\nwere also very popular with our\\n \\nmembers. Having launched our original film initiative just under five years ago, this is a proud\\n \\nachievement and a testament to the creative talent with whom we partner\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nAcross both film and TV, we were also recognized for being the home for storytellers and creators from\\n \\nmany diverse backgrounds. We’re honored to lead the industry in nominations at both the \\n\\u200b\\nNAACP Image\\n \\nAwards\\n\\u200b\\n (42 nominations) and the \\n\\u200b\\nGLAAD Media Awards\\n\\u200b\\n (15 nominations).\\n \\n \\nWe know that local audiences love local stories. In fact, local originals were the most popular 2019 titles\\n \\nin many countries, including India, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Thailand, Sweden and the UK. In addition,\\n \\nwe\\'ve seen how members all around the world also love these stories with \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel/Money\\n \\nHeist\\n\\u200b\\n appearing on our top ten lists in more than 70 countries. K-content is also popular globally, and\\n \\nwe\\'re investing heavily in Korean stories. In this past quarter, we inked a TV output deal with JTBC, a\\n \\nleading Korean media company, and a strategic partnership with CJ ENM’s Studio Dragon, Korea’s\\n \\nlargest TV studio. These deals will enable us to bring more K-dramas to fans all over the world.\\n \\n3\\n \\nOver the past several years, we’ve been developing an animation studio within Netflix to produce a wide\\n \\narray of animated content for kids, adults and families. We have amazing creators with pedigree from\\n \\nDisney Animation, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination now working at Netflix on their next\\n \\nbig projects. In Q4, we debuted filmmaker Sergio Pablos’ \\n\\u200b\\nKlaus\\n\\u200b\\n, our first original feature-length\\n \\nanimated film that was also nominated for an Academy Award. In its first 28 days, 40m members chose\\n \\nto watch this heartwarming Santa Claus origin story. Later in 2020, we’ll premiere the ambitious \\n\\u200b\\nOver\\n \\nThe Moon\\n\\u200b\\n, from legendary animator Glen Keane, followed by a schedule that builds to several big\\n \\nanimated feature films per year.\\n \\nAs we’ve expanded our original content, we’ve been working on how to best share content highlights\\n \\nthat demonstrate popularity. Given that we now have titles with widely varying lengths - from short\\n \\nepisodes (e.g. \\n\\u200b\\nSpecial\\n\\u200b\\n at around 15 minutes) to long films (e.g. \\n\\u200b\\nThe Highwaymen\\n\\u200b\\n at 132 minutes), we\\n \\nbelieve that reporting households viewing a title based on 70% of a single episode of a series or of an\\n \\nentire film, which we have been doing, makes less sense. We are now reporting on households\\n \\n(accounts) that chose to watch a given title\\n. Our new methodology is similar to the BBC iPlayer in their\\n \\n1\\nrankings\\n\\u200b\\n based on “requests” for the title, “most popular” articles on the New York Times which include\\n \\nthose who opened the articles, and YouTube view counts. This way, short and long titles are treated\\n \\nequally, leveling the playing field for all types of our content including interactive content, which has no\\n \\nfixed length. The new metric is about 35% higher on average than the prior metric. For example, 45m\\n \\nmember households chose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nOur Planet\\n\\u200b\\n under the new metric vs. 33m under the prior metric.\\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nIn Product, we are investing our resources to grow engagement and our storytelling capabilities (like the\\n \\nbranching narratives in \\n\\u200b\\nBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\\n\\u200b\\n), deepen our penetration in key markets and help\\n \\nour members find great content through better suggestions. To do this, we try many approaches; in\\n \\n2019 alone, we conducted hundreds of product tests to try to improve our member experience from\\n \\nsign up to billing and payments to content discovery. About 30% of these led to a gain in retention,\\n \\nengagement or revenue, up from 20% in the prior year. It’s a humbling exercise as so many of our ideas\\n \\ndo not “win” with members, but this helps tune our judgment and innovation priorities for the future.\\n \\n \\nIn Q4, we launched a mobile-only plan in Malaysia and Indonesia (which we introduced to India in Q3\\n \\nlast year). We’ve seen similar results with this plan driving incremental subscriber growth and improving\\n \\nretention. We expect the mobile-only plan to be revenue-positive which will allow us to further invest in\\n \\ncontent to be enjoyed by our members and continue to feed the virtuous cycle. We plan to continue to\\n \\ntest adding this plan, as well as additional ideas in other countries around the world.\\n \\nCompetition\\n \\n \\nMany media companies and tech giants are launching streaming services, reinforcing the major trend of\\n \\nthe transition from linear to streaming entertainment. This is happening all over the world and is still in\\n \\nits early stages, leaving ample room for many services to grow as linear TV wanes. We have a big\\n \\n1\\n Chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes -- long enough to indicate the choice was intentional\\n \\n-- is the precise definition\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nheadstart in streaming and will work to build on that by focusing on the same thing we have focused on\\n \\nfor the past 22 years - pleasing members. We believe if we do that well, Netflix will continue to prosper.\\n \\nAs an example, in Q4, despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per\\n \\nmembership grew both globally and in the US on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters.\\n \\nBelow is a comparison of \\n\\u200b\\nGoogle search trends\\n\\u200b\\n for \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n, Disney’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Mandalorian\\n\\u200b\\n, Amazon’s\\n \\nJack Ryan\\n\\u200b\\n and Apple’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Morning Show\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nSource: Google Trends. Note: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+ are global x-China, while Disney+ is only in NL, US, CA, and AU. If\\n \\nDisney+ were global we don’t think the picture would be much different, to judge from the \\n\\u200b\\nNL results\\n\\u200b\\n where Disney+ first launched.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nIn Q4, net cash used in operating activities was -$1.5 billion vs. -$1.2 billion in the prior year period. Free\\n \\ncash flow (FCF)\\n in Q4 totaled -$1.7 billion vs. -$1.3 billion in Q4’18. For the full year, FCF was -$3.3\\n \\n2\\nbillion which we believe is the peak in our annual FCF deficit.\\n \\n \\nOur plan is to continually improve FCF each year and to move slowly toward FCF positive. For 2020, we\\n \\ncurrently forecast FCF of approximately -$2.5 billion. Along the way, we’ll continue to use the debt\\n \\nmarket to finance our investment needs as we did in Q4’19, when we raised $1.0 billion 4.875% senior\\n \\nnotes and \\n€\\n1.1 billion 3.625% senior notes, both due in 2030. With our FCF profile improving, this means\\n \\nthat over time we’ll be less reliant on public markets and will be able to fund more of our investment\\n \\nneeds organically through our growing operating profits.\\n \\n \\n2\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the\\n \\nreconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n \\n5\\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2019\\n\\u200b\\n,  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2019\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJanuary 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2018\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\nAppendix\\n \\nTable 1\\n\\xa0\\n \\n \\n6\\n \\nTable 2 (Final letter for this table)\\n\\xa0\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7\\n \\nJanuary 21, 2020 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST\\n \\nOur video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm\\n \\nPST today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are\\n \\nimportant liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated\\n \\nthat is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the\\n \\namount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of\\n \\nthese non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial\\n \\nstatements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding global paid net additions; churn; seasonality;;\\n \\ndistribution of net adds across quarters; full-year operating margin target; future content offerings;\\n \\nproduct tests; revenue impact of product changes; future capital raises; reliance on public markets for\\n \\ncash needs; impact of competition; global streaming paid memberships and growth; consolidated\\n \\nrevenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and\\n \\npeak free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties\\n \\nthat could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract\\n \\nnew members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and\\n \\nexpansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service\\n \\ndisruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including\\n \\nconsumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.

In Q3, we grewrevenue 16% year over year to $7.5 billion, while operating income rose 33% vs. the prior year quarter to$1.8 billion. We added 4.4m paid net adds (vs. 2.2m in Q3’20) to end the quarter with 214m paidmemberships. We’re very excited to finish the year with what we expect to be our strongest Q4 contentoffering yet, which shows up as bigger content expense and lower operating margins sequentially.\\nQ3 R esults and Q4 F orecast\\nRevenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 9% and 7% increase in average paid streaming memberships andARM, respectively. Excluding a foreign exchange (FX)impact of +$128m, ARM rose 5% year over year.1\\nOperating margin for Q3 amounted to 23.5%, a three percentage point increase vs. the year ago period.This was above our beginning of quarter forecast due to the timing of content spend, as well as lowerthan forecasted marketing spend. EPS of $3.19 vs. $1.74 a year ago included a $136m non-cashunrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\nWe under-forecasted paid net adds for the quarter (4.4m actual vs. our 3.5m projection), while endingpaid memberships of 214m was within 0.4% of our forecast. For the second consecutive quarter, theAPAC region was our largest contributor to membership growth with 2.2m paid net adds (half of totalpaid net adds) as we are continuing to improve our service in this region. In EMEA, paid net adds of 1.8mimproved sequentially vs. the 188k in Q2 as several titles had a particularly strong impact. The UCAN and\\n1ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nLATAM regions grew paid memberships more slowly. These regions have higher penetration ofbroadband homes although we believe we still have ample runway for growth as we continue to improveour service.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we reportand we strive for accuracy. For Q4’21, we forecast paid net adds of 8.5m, consistent with Q4’20 paid netadditions. For the full year 2021, we forecast an operating margin of 20% or slightly better. This meansthat Q4’21 operating margin will be approximately 6.5% compared with 14% in Q4’20. The year overyear decline in operating margin is due mostly to our backloaded big content release schedule in this Q4,which will result in a roughly 19% year over year increase in content amortization for Q4’21 (comparedwith ~8% growth year to date).\\nContent\\nOur programming strategy is to provide members with a wide variety of high quality content that’s lovedand watched in large numbers. Season five ofLa Casade Papel(akaMoney Heist) and season three ofSex Educationwere two of our biggest returning showsin the quarter with 69m and 55m memberhouseholds, respectively, choosing to watch these fan favorites in the first four weeks. On the heels ofThe Queen’s Gambit, we’ve had another limited serieshit withMaidwhich launched just afterquarter-end on October 1. We expect this story about living on the poverty line by award-winningplaywright and screenwriter Molly Smith Metzler to reach 67m households during its first four weeks.\\nLa Casa de Papelwas our first non-English languagetitle to show that - with subtitling and dubbing -great stories truly can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. We are now producing local TVand film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communitiesaround the world. While the goal of our local content executives is always to create locally authenticstories that will resonate in their country (likeThe Chestnut Manwhich we expect to be watched by\\n2\\napproximately two thirds of our Danish members during its first four weeks), Netflix is a global,direct-to-consumer service which enables creators to reach broader audiences - and gives our membersan even greater choice of stories to enjoy.\\nThere is no better example of this thanSquid Game,a unique Korean story that first captured thezeitgeist in Korea and then globally. Released on September 17, it has becomeour biggest TV show ever.A mind-boggling142mmember households globally havechosen to watch the title in its first four weeks.The breadth ofSquid Game’s popularity is truly amazing;this show has been ranked as our #1 program in94 countries (including the US). Like some of our other big hits,Squid Gamehas also pierced the culturalzeitgeist, spawning aSaturday Night Liveskitandmemes/clips on TikTokwith more than 42 billion views.Demand for consumer products to celebrate the fandom forSquid Gameis high and those items are ontheir way to retail now.\\nOur film slate also continues to build with a variety of successful Q3 titles such as action filmSweetGirlstarring Jason Momoa (68m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks),Kissing Booth 3(59m), the last installment in the rom com trilogy, the animated family filmVivo(46m) andBlood RedSky, a German-language action horror movie (53m).\\nLater in the year, we will shift to reporting on hours viewed for our titles rather than the number ofaccounts that choose to watch them. There is some difference in rankings, as you see below, but wethink engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of ourtitles and member satisfaction. It also matches how outside services measure TV viewing and givesproper credit to rewatching. In addition, we will start to release title metrics more regularly outside ofour earnings report so our members and the industry can better measure success in the streamingworld.\\n3\\n* Total hour s vie wed per title in its fir st 28 da ys on Ne tflix. ** The number of acc ounts tha t have watched a t leas t two minut esof tha t title in its fir st 28 da ys on Ne tflix. Da ta as of 9/27/21.\\nWe’re honored to have garnered the most Emmys ever for any single network or service in a season oftelevision, with 44 (tying CBS’ tally in 1974 when there were only three national networks). This includedour first best Drama series win (The Crown), whileThe Queen’s Gambitwon 11 out of 18 nominations,including the coveted best limited series. Both titles are among our most popular ever, demonstratingcritical and commercial success.\\nDuring Q3, we announced our agreement to acquire theRoald Dahl Story Company, pending regulatoryapproval. This was an opportunity to purchase a beloved and enduring portfolio of intellectual propertyincludingCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,Matilda,The BFG,James and the Giant Peach,Fantastic Mr.FoxandThe Twits, to name just a few. Roald Dahl’sbooks have been translated into 63 languages andhave sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. Once we close, we’ll be looking to develop evenmore of these stories into new formats across the live action television and films, animation andpre-school categories.\\nWe’ve begun testing our games offering in select countries. It remains very early days for this initiativeand, like other content categories we’ve expanded into, we plan to try different types of games, learnfrom our members and improve our game library. During Q3, we acquiredNight School Studio, themaker of critically acclaimed games likeOXENFREE,to help build out our game development capabilities.\\n4\\nAs a reminder, games on Netflix will be included in members’ subscriptions and will not haveadvertisements or in-app purchases so game play is purely focused on enjoyment versus monetization.\\nWe’re eagerly anticipating the rest of our Q4 slate, which includes a great mix of popular returningEnglish language series likeThe Witcher,You, TigerKingandCobra Kai, big returning non-English serieslikeSintoniaand the final chapter ofLa Casa dePapel(akaMoney Heist), as well as exciting new moviessuch as the action filmRed Notice(starring DwayneJohnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds),Don’t LookUpwith an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio,Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill,Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep, as well asThe Harder They FallfeaturingJonathanMajors, Zazie Beetz, LaKeith Stanfield, Regina King and Idris Elba,Army of Thieves(the prequel to ourhitmovie,Army of the Dead) andThe UnforgivablestarringSandra Bullock, Viola Davis and Jon Bernthal.The latest films from acclaimed directors Jane Campion (The Power Of The Dog) and Paolo Sorrentino(The Hand of God) are also coming to Netflix in Q4.\\nAssuming no new Covid waves or unforeseen events that result in large scale production shutdowns, wecurrently anticipate a more normalized content slate in 2022, with a greater number of originals in 2022vs. 2021 and a release schedule that is more balanced over the course of the year, as compared to 2021.\\nProduct\\nWe try many different approaches to see what might help our growth. One example in Q3 was thelaunch of a free plan for mobile users in Kenya. This plan is a great way for anyone in Kenya with anAndroid mobile phone to explore Netflix - with access to great content, personalized recommendations,and parental controls. We hope that this encourages more people to sign up for a paid membership sothat they can watch Netflix on any device (mobile, TV, or laptop), access more features (e.g. downloads)and enjoy our entire catalog. It will take a year or two to determine if this technique helps our paidmembership growth or not.\\nWe know that members most value the variety and quality of our content. Great recommendations arekey to ensuring they can experience that breadth and diversity. So we continue to invest in ourrecommendations to ensure members can easily find great stories to enjoy on our service. One exampleof our ability to surface relevant programming isManifest, a TV series that aired on NBC for threeseasons and was subsequently cancelled in June 2021. We addedManifestto our service in the US andCanada during the summer of 2021. In the UCAN region, 25m member households chose to watch thistitle in its first 28 days and we’ve ordered a fourth and final season given the popularity of the show.\\nMark eting & Communic ations\\nIn addition to having best in class content and a product experience that allows members to easily findshows and movies they love, we also want our programming to be talked about and in the culturalzeitgeist. In September, we held our first global fan event,TUDUM, which featured news, first looksandtrailers from over 100 of the most anticipated Netflix films and series of the next 12 months. TUDUMwas a new way for us to connect fans with our titles, talent and brand and to drive conversation at aglobal scale and trended at #2 globally the day of the event on Twitter. Additionally, TUDUM and the\\n5\\ntrailers/content released following the event were watched by fans in over 180 countries, generatingclose to 700m views and more than 3 billion impressions in less than four days.\\nCompe tition\\nWe compete with a staggeringly large set of activities for consumers’ time and attention like watchinglinear TV, reading a book, browsing TikTok, or playing Fortnite, to name just a few. As one example of thisdynamic, on October 4, when Facebook experienced a global outage for several hours, our engagementsaw a 14% increase during this time period.\\nWe are still quite small, with a lot of opportunity for growth; in our largest and most penetrated market,according to Nielsen, we are still less than 10% of US television screen time. Our approach as always is toimprove our service as quickly as we can so that we can earn a greater share of people’s time.\\nShare of Total US TV Time, September 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+)\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $82 million vs. $1.3 billion in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)for the quarter was-$106 million vs. $1.1 billion in Q3‘20. FCF in last year’s2\\nQ3 was helped by COVID-related production shutdowns. Year to date FCF is $410m. With productionvolume ramping successfully and a lower operating margin in Q4, we anticipate Q4 ‘21 FCF to benegative. We continue to expect full year 2021 FCF to be approximately breakeven (plus or minus severalhundred million dollars depending on the timing of production starts and related cash spending oncontent). We anticipate being FCF positive on an annual basis in 2022 and beyond.\\n2\\nFor a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes \\nthereto.\\n6\\nAs we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund ourday-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repurchased 0.2m shares for $100 million. Our slowerbuyback pace this quarter reflects the pick up in our M&A activity. As a reminder, we prioritize our cashto reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selectiveacquisitions. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above and beyond our minimum cash levelswill be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nIn March, we committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022 and to reduceour emissions to be in line with the latest climate science, ensuring that our internal reductions are\\nconsistent with a trajectory of no more than 1.5\\n℃\\n of warming. We’ve been making progress on thisinitiative.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures,during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, makestrategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However,this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superiorto, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in)operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to theGAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unauditedfinancial statements.\\nForward-Looking StatementsThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federalsecurities laws, including statements regarding our expected results for the fiscal quarter and yearending December 31, 2021; investment in our service; average revenue per membership; adoption ofinternet entertainment and impact on growth; competitive position; future content offerings, includinggames, and the number, timing and performance of such offerings; product enhancements and offerings;cash spending on content; stock repurchases; impact of production delays; emissions commitments;future capital and external financing needs; debt; global streaming paid memberships, paid netadditions, membership growth and retention; consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income,operating margin, net income, content amortization and earnings per share; and free cash flow.

       "  'content': \"July 16, 2020\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\nWe live in uncertain times with restrictions on what we can do socially and many people are turning to\\n \\nentertainment for relaxation, connection, comfort and stimulation. In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant\\n \\npull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million\\n \\npaid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million). As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020\\n \\ncompared to the prior year. As we navigate these turbulent circumstances, we’re focused on our\\n \\nmembers by continuing to improve the quality of our service and bringing new films and shows to\\n \\npeople's screens. Our Q2 summary results and forecast for Q3 are in the table below.\\n \\n \\n \\nTed Sarandos appointed co-CEO and elected to Board of\\n \\nDirectors\\n \\nTed joined Netflix over 20 years ago, and we are thrilled to appoint him to be co-CEO with Reed.  “Ted\\n \\nhas been my partner for decades. This change makes formal what was already informal -- that Ted and I\\n \\nshare the leadership of Netflix,” says Hastings.  Lead Independent director Jay Hoag says “Having\\n \\nwatched Reed and Ted work together for so long, the board and I are confident this is the right step to\\n \\nevolve Netflix’s management structure so that we can continue to best serve our members and\\n \\nshareholders for years to come.”\\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nTed will also continue to serve as Chief Content Officer. In addition, Greg Peters has been appointed\\n \\nCOO adding to his Chief Product Officer role. “We want Greg to help us stay aligned and effective as we\\n \\ngrow so quickly around the world,” said Hastings.\\n \\nQ2 Results and Q3 Forecast\\n \\nIn Q2, revenue grew 25% year over year, while quarterly operating income exceeded $1 billion. Average\\n \\nstreaming paid memberships in Q2 rose 25% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 0.4% year\\n \\nover year. Excluding a -$289m impact from foreign exchange (F/X), streaming ARPU grew 5% year over\\n \\nyear. Operating margin expanded 770 basis points year over year to 22.1%, above our guidance forecast\\n \\ndue to higher than expected membership and revenue growth. In addition, content and marketing\\n \\nexpenses were lower than we expected, as the pandemic delayed some planned spend. EPS of $1.59 vs.\\n \\n$0.60 a year ago included a $119m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro\\n \\ndenominated debt and a $220m non-cash valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (due to recent\\n \\nlegislation limiting the use of California R&D credits). Our Q2 effective tax rate of 30.5% includes about a\\n \\n21% point negative impact due to the valuation allowance.\\n \\n \\nWe added a Q2-record 10.1m paid memberships vs. 2.7m in last year’s Q2. The positive variance relative\\n \\nto our 7.5m forecast was due to better-than-forecast acquisition and retention. In the first half of this\\n \\nyear, we’ve added 26m paid memberships, nearly on par with the 28m we achieved in all of 2019.\\n \\nHowever, as we expected (and can be seen in the graph below), growth is slowing as consumers get\\n \\nthrough the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions. Our paid net additions for the month of June\\n \\nalso included the subscriptions we \\n\\u200b\\ncancelled\\n\\u200b\\n for the small percentage of members who had not used the\\n \\nservice recently.\\n \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nThe quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for\\n \\naccuracy. We forecast 2.5m paid net adds for Q3’20 vs. 6.8m in the prior year quarter. As we indicated in\\n \\nour Q1’20 letter, we’re expecting paid net adds will be down year over year in the second half as our\\n \\nstrong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year. In\\n \\naddition, Q3’19 included the positive impact of new seasons of both \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de\\n \\nPapel (\\n\\u200b\\naka\\n\\u200b\\n Money Heist)\\n\\u200b\\n. We continue to view the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not\\n \\nthat meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment which we believe\\n \\nprovides us with many years of strong growth ahead.\\n \\n \\nFor the full year 2020, we’re still targeting a 16% operating margin. We’re currently on track to exceed\\n \\n16% although F/X (and the relative strength of the US dollar) remains a wildcard. As always, our\\n \\nintention is to grow our annual operating margin year over year - we’re currently targeting 19% for\\n \\n2021.\\n \\nContent\\n \\nAs the world slowly re-opens, our main business priority is to restart our productions safely and in a\\n \\nmanner consistent with local health and safety standards to ensure that our members can enjoy a\\n \\ndiverse range of high quality new content. Given the significant differences between countries (e.g.,\\n \\nincidence of new Covid-19 cases, availability of testing, government and industry regulations), there is\\n \\nno one-size-fits-all approach, and we’re adapting to local circumstances.\\n \\n \\nToday, we’re slowly resuming productions in many parts of the world. We are furthest along in Asia\\n \\nPacific (where we never fully shut down in Korea, for example) and are now shooting live action series\\n \\nlike season 2 of our Japanese original \\n\\u200b\\nThe Naked Director\\n\\u200b\\n. In EMEA, we are now back in production in\\n \\nmany countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Italy, and the UK. While we recently resumed\\n \\nproduction on two films in California and two stop-motion animation projects in Oregon and expect\\n \\nsome more of our US productions to get going this quarter, current infection trends create more\\n \\nuncertainty for our productions in the US. Parts of the world like India and some of Latin America are\\n \\nalso more challenging and we are hoping to restart later in the year in these regions.\\n \\nSince our content production lead time is long, our 2020 plans for launching original shows and films\\n \\ncontinue to be largely intact. For 2021, based on our current plan, we expect the paused productions\\n \\nwill lead to a more second half weighted content slate in terms of our big titles, although we anticipate\\n \\nthe total number of originals for the full year will still be higher than 2020. We’ll also round out our\\n \\ncontent offering with film acquisitions like \\n\\u200b\\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\\n\\u200b\\n from Aaron Sorkin and \\n\\u200b\\nThe\\n \\nSpongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run\\n\\u200b\\n (global excluding US and China). We also acquired nearly\\n \\ncompleted seasons of unreleased original series like \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai \\n\\u200b\\n(seasons 1, 2 and a brand new season 3)\\n \\nand \\n\\u200b\\nEmily in Paris \\n\\u200b\\nstarring Lily Collins.\\n \\n \\nThe pandemic and pauses in production are impacting our competitors and suppliers similarly. With our\\n \\nlarge library of thousands of titles and strong recommendations, we believe our member satisfaction\\n \\nwill remain high.\\n \\n3\\n \\nIn Q2, we notched successes in many of our key content verticals. In English scripted TV, \\n\\u200b\\nNever Have I\\n \\nEver\\n\\u200b\\n, a fun, young adult dramedy from Mindy Kaling, broke through with 40m households choosing to\\n \\nwatch this show in its first four weeks, and 40m households for our new comedy \\n\\u200b\\nSpace Force\\n\\u200b\\n (starring\\n \\nSteve Carell). On the heels of \\n\\u200b\\nLove is Blind\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nToo Hot to Handle\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nFloor is Lava\\n\\u200b\\n are the latest in our line\\n \\nof buzzy unscripted shows (51m and a projected 37m households, respectively, in the first four weeks).\\n \\n \\nIn original films, 27 million households chose to watch Spike Lee’s \\n\\u200b\\nDa 5 Bloods\\n\\u200b\\n, which was celebrated as\\n \\na “\\n\\u200b\\nsoul stirring film for the ages\\n\\u200b\\n.” \\n\\u200b\\nExtraction\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Chris Hemsworth) and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Wrong Missy\\n\\u200b\\n, a comedy\\n \\nstarring David Spade and Lauren Lapkus, were also big hits with audiences (99m and 59m households,\\n \\nrespectively, chose to watch in their first 28 days). In addition, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Willoughbys\\n\\u200b\\n (38m households in the\\n \\nfirst four weeks) is an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster\\n \\nour offering for kids and families.\\n \\n \\nWe also saw increased viewing for some older titles like \\n\\u200b\\n13th\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nAmerican Son\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nDear White People\\n\\u200b\\n - all\\n \\npart of our \\n\\u200b\\nBlack Lives Matter Collection\\n\\u200b\\n - as our members sought out stories that speak to racial\\n \\ninjustice and the Black experience in America.\\n \\n \\nOur local language originals - like \\n\\u200b\\nDark\\n\\u200b\\n in Germany, \\n\\u200b\\nControl Z\\n\\u200b\\n in Mexico, \\n\\u200b\\nExtracurricular\\n\\u200b\\n in Korea, \\n\\u200b\\nThe\\n \\nWoods\\n\\u200b\\n in Poland, or \\n\\u200b\\nBlood & Water\\n\\u200b\\n in South Africa - continue to be highly impactful, driving large\\n \\nviewing, buzz and sign-ups in their home countries. We continue to see these stories find audiences all\\n \\nover the world. The best example of this was \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist): Part 4\\n\\u200b\\n, which we\\n \\nlaunched on April 3; through its first 28 days, 65m households chose to watch this hit show.\\n \\n \\nFor Q3, we recently released \\n\\u200b\\nThe Old Guard\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Charlize Theron), which continues our recent string\\n \\nof adrenaline-filled action movies. Later in July, we’re looking forward to launching season 2 of \\n\\u200b\\nThe\\n \\nUmbrella Academy\\n\\u200b\\n, followed by \\n\\u200b\\nThe Kissing Booth 2\\n\\u200b\\n (the sequel to our hit romantic comedy), \\n\\u200b\\nProject\\n \\nPower\\n\\u200b\\n (an action movie starring Jamie Foxx) and \\n\\u200b\\nEnola Holmes\\n\\u200b\\n (featuring Millie Bobbie Brown as the\\n \\nsister of Sherlock Holmes, played by Henry Cavill) later in the quarter.\\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe continue to test different pricing approaches in some countries including lower priced, mobile-only\\n \\nplans and our bundled offerings with MVPDs and ISPs. While some of these carry lower ARPU, the goal is\\n \\nto accelerate membership growth on neutral-to-better short term revenue (with incremental acquisition\\n \\nand improved retention offsetting the lower price). We think this strategy will increase long term\\n \\nrevenue as a larger membership base can generate more word-of-mouth around our content and help\\n \\nus better understand peoples’ needs in that country - so that we can more quickly improve our catalog\\n \\nand product experience, which would then lead to higher member satisfaction and growth as well as\\n \\nimproved long term retention.\\n \\n \\nA very small percentage of our members have not watched anything for the last two years and although\\n \\nwe make it easy for people to cancel their subscriptions with just a few clicks, they have not taken\\n \\nadvantage of that ability. So we decided to stop billing them and will do so for members meeting the\\n \\nsame criteria going forward. Like all of our former members, they can easily restart their membership in\\n \\nthe future. While this change resulted in a slight hit to revenue, we believe that pro-consumer policies\\n \\n4\\n \\nlike this are the right thing to do and that the long term benefits will outweigh the short term costs. In a\\n \\nworld where consumers have many subscriptions, auto-pause on billing after an extended period of\\n \\nnon-use should be how leading services operate.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nAll of the major entertainment companies like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal are pushing their\\n \\nown streaming services and two of the most valuable companies in the world, Apple and Amazon, are\\n \\ngrowing their investment in premium content. In addition, TikTok’s growth is astounding, showing the\\n \\nfluidity of internet entertainment. Instead of worrying about all these competitors, we continue to stick\\n \\nto our strategy of trying to improve our service and content every quarter faster than our peers. Our\\n \\ncontinued strong growth is a testament to this approach and the size of the entertainment market.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash generated in operating activities in Q2 was +$1 billion vs. -$544 million in the prior year period.\\n \\nFree cash flow\\n was positive for a second consecutive quarter at +$899m vs. -$594 million. Free cash\\n \\n1\\nflow was higher than net income due primarily to the loss on FX remeasurement and the valuation\\n \\nallowance for deferred tax assets, both of which were non-cash items that reduced net income.\\n \\n \\nOur FCF profile is continuing to improve, which is being driven in part by our growing operating margin\\n \\nand the digestion of our big move into the production of Netflix originals that requires more cash\\n \\nupfront vs. licensed content. In addition, the pause in production has also pushed out cash spending on\\n \\ncontent into the second half of 2020 and into 2021.\\n \\nDue to the pause in production from the pandemic combined with higher-than-forecast paid net adds\\n \\nyear to date, we now expect free cash flow for the full year 2020 to be breakeven to positive, compared\\n \\nwith our prior expectation for -$1 billion or better. As we indicated last quarter, in 2021 we project that\\n \\nfull year free cash flow will dip back to being negative again, although we believe the FCF deficit will be\\n \\nmaterially better than our peak deficit level of -$3.3 billion in 2019. There has been no material change\\n \\nin our overall estimated timetable to reach consistent annual positive FCF within the next few years.\\n \\n \\nWe’re often asked by investors what our FCF profile would be at “steady state” or when our cash\\n \\ncontent spending matches our content amortization. The pandemic and the resulting pause in\\n \\nproductions provides one early snapshot of what that may look like. In Q2’20, our cash spending on\\n \\ncontent was $2.6 billion, equivalent to our content amortization of $2.6 billion, or a 1x cash\\n \\ncontent-to-content amortization ratio\\n. This resulted in a FCF margin of +15% in Q2. Of course, our plan\\n \\n2\\nis to continue to grow our content spend (as we don’t believe we are anywhere near maturity), but the\\n \\nabove analysis may prove illustrative. And by the time our cash content-to-content amortization ratio\\n \\n1\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer\\n \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes\\n \\nthereto.\\n \\n2\\n For additional details on these concepts, please refer to our Content Accounting Overview slide deck on\\n \\nour investor relations \\n\\u200b\\nsite\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n5\\n \\nreaches 1x on a sustained basis (which is still many years away), we hope to have many more members\\n \\nand much greater revenue, operating margin and FCF.\\n \\n \\nIn April, we raised $1 billion of debt at a blended rate of ~3.3% across both US dollar and Euro tranches.\\n \\nWe ended Q2 with more than $7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.\\n \\n \\nAs part of our commitment to racial equity, we allocated about two percent of our cash holdings -\\n \\ninitially up to $100 million - into financial institutions and organizations that directly \\n\\u200b\\nsupport Black\\n \\ncommunities\\n\\u200b\\n in the US. We hope other US large-caps will also consider taking this small and relatively\\n \\neasy step to bolster US racial economic equity.\\n \\n \\nWith our cash balance, $750 million credit facility (which remains undrawn) and improving FCF profile,\\n \\nwe have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for over 12 months. As a result, we don’t expect to\\n \\naccess the debt markets for the remainder of 2020 and we believe our need for external financing is\\n \\ndiminishing.\\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2020\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2020\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2019\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJuly 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2018\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n6\\n \\nRegional Breakdown\\n \\n \\n \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 16, 2020 Earnings Interview, 3pm PT\\n \\nOur video interview with Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays Capital will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm\\n \\nPT today.  \\n\\u200b\\nQuestions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to\\n \\nkannan.venkateshwar@barclayscapital.com. \\n\\u200b\\nReed Hastings, co-CEO, Spence Neumann, CFO, Ted\\n \\nSarandos, co-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Greg Peters, COO and Chief Product Officer and Spencer\\n \\nWang, VP of IR/Corporate Development will all be on the video to answer Kannan’s questions.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7\\n \\nIR Contact:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSpencer Wang\\n \\n  VP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development\\n \\n  408 809-5360\\n \\n \\n \\nPR Contact:\\n \\n \\nRichard Siklos\\n \\nVP,  Communications\\n \\n      408 540-2629\\n \\n \\n \\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free\\n \\ncash flow and adjusted EBITDA.

However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

       "  'content': \"July 17, 2019\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\nAs expected, revenue growth accelerated 400 basis points to 26%, and operating income increased 53%\\n \\nyear over year in Q2. Paid membership grew by 2.7m, less than the 5.5m in Q2 a year ago and our 5.0m\\n \\nforecast. In Q3, we expect to grow by 7m paid memberships, more than the 6.1m in Q3 a year ago.\\n \\nConsumers around the world continue to move from linear television to internet entertainment at a\\n \\nremarkable rate.\\n \\n \\n \\nQ2 Results and Q3 Forecast\\n \\nAverage streaming paid memberships increased 24% year over year, while ARPU increased 3% year over\\n \\nyear on a reported basis. Excluding the year over year foreign exchange (F/X) impact on revenue of\\n \\n-$265 million, global streaming ARPU grew 9%, with 12% and 7% ARPU growth in the US and\\n \\ninternational segments, respectively. Operating margin of 14.3% (up 250 bps year over year) was higher\\n \\nthan our beginning-of-quarter forecast as some marketing spend was shifted into the second half of the\\n \\nyear. EPS amounted to $0.60 vs. $0.85 and included a $61 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X\\n \\nremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming content obligations decreased 2%\\n \\nsequentially, reflecting our shift to more owned (vs. licensed) content.\\n \\n1\\n \\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.\\n \\nWe strive for accuracy (not conservatism), which means that in some quarters we will be high and other\\n \\nquarters low relative to our guidance. In Q2’19, our membership growth forecast was high.\\n \\n \\n \\nOur missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases. We don’t\\n \\nbelieve competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape\\n \\nduring Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our\\n \\nover-forecast was in every region). Rather, we think Q2’s content slate drove less growth in paid net\\n \\nadds than we anticipated. Additionally, Q1 was so large for us (9.6m net adds), there may have been\\n \\nmore pull-forward effect than we realized. In prior quarters with over-forecasts, we’ve found that the\\n \\nunderlying long-term growth was not affected and staying focused on the fundamentals of our business\\n \\nserved us well.\\n \\n \\nQ3 has started with \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n season 3, and the first two weeks of Q3 are strong. In addition to\\n \\nthe recently released season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n, our second half content slate includes new seasons of\\n \\nLa Casa de Papel\\n\\u200b\\n (\\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n), \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n, and the final season of the iconic \\n\\u200b\\nOrange is the New Black\\n\\u200b\\n as\\n \\nwell as big films like \\n\\u200b\\nThe Irishman\\n\\u200b\\n from Martin Scorsese and action movie \\n\\u200b\\n6 Underground\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by\\n \\nMichael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds).\\n \\n \\nWhile our US paid membership was essentially flat in Q2, we expect it to return to more typical growth\\n \\nin Q3, and are seeing that in these early weeks of Q3. We forecast Q3 global paid net adds of 7.0m, up\\n \\nvs. 6.1m in Q3’18, with 0.8m in the US and 6.2m internationally. Our internal forecast still currently calls\\n \\nfor annual global paid net adds to be up year over year. There’s no change to our 13% operating margin\\n \\ntarget for FY19, up 300 basis points year over year.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nOur Q2 content slate featured several highly watched titles. We launched \\n\\u200b\\nDead to Me\\n\\u200b\\n, a dramedy\\n \\nstarring 2019 Emmy nominated Best Actress Christina Applegate, which was watched by 30m\\n \\nhouseholds in its first four weeks. We’ve renewed this half hour comedy for a second season. We’re also\\n \\nproud of \\n\\u200b\\nWhen They See Us\\n\\u200b\\n, a moving limited series based on the Central Park Five case, from Ava\\n \\nDuVernay. This powerful story was watched by 25m households in its first four weeks and has stirred a\\n \\nglobal conversation about race, identity, and criminal justice. \\n\\u200b\\nWhen They See Us\\n\\u200b\\n was also just nominated\\n \\nfor 16 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Limited Series. \\n\\u200b\\nOur Planet\\n\\u200b\\n was our most ambitious\\n \\nundertaking in the documentary category to date and it’s also our highest-watched original docu-series\\n \\nthrough its first four weeks (33m households) and was just nominated for 10 Emmy Awards.\\n \\nWe are making good progress with our original films portfolio with more and more of our films creating\\n \\nlarger audiences than our pay 1 licensed movies. At the end of June, we premiered our latest Adam\\n \\nSandler movie \\n\\u200b\\nMurder Mystery\\n\\u200b\\n (also starring Jennifer Aniston), which is the most watched Adam Sandler\\n \\nNetflix original film to date; over 73m households watched this film in its first four weeks. In Q2, the\\n \\nyoung adult romantic comedy movie \\n\\u200b\\nThe Perfect Date\\n\\u200b\\n (featuring Noah Centineo from our big film \\n\\u200b\\nTo All\\n \\nThe Boys I’ve Loved Before\\n\\u200b\\n) was a global hit with 48m households in its first four weeks. Similarly, Ali\\n \\nWong co-starred with Randall Park in \\n\\u200b\\nAlways Be My Maybe \\n\\u200b\\n(directed by Nahnatchka Khan), which was\\n \\nviewed by 32m households in its first four weeks.\\n \\n \\nSeason 2 of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Rain\\n\\u200b\\n was among the largest returning seasons for one of our non-English language\\n \\noriginals, while Swedish series \\n\\u200b\\nQuicksand\\n\\u200b\\n was a new show that was highly watched both locally and\\n \\nglobally. We also debuted several local-language titles that were very popular in their home territories\\n \\nlike the first two installments of the \\n\\u200b\\nHistoria de un Crimen \\n\\u200b\\nfranchise (\\n\\u200b\\nHistoria de un Crimen: Colosio\\n\\u200b\\n and\\n \\n3\\n \\nHistoria de un Crimen: Colmenares\\n\\u200b\\n) in Latin America, while \\n\\u200b\\nFamily Business\\n\\u200b\\n was a breakthrough hit for us\\n \\nin France.\\n \\n \\nWe’ve been moving our content from semi-exclusive catalog and 2nd-window unbranded content to\\n \\nbranded exclusive 1st window original content for many years. Much of our domestic, and eventually\\n \\nglobal, Disney catalog, as well as \\n\\u200b\\nFriends\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nThe Office\\n\\u200b\\n, and some other licensed content will wind down\\n \\nover the coming years, freeing up budget for more original content. We don’t have material viewing\\n \\nconcentration as even our largest titles (that are watched by millions of members) account for only a\\n \\nlow single digit percentage of streaming hours. From what we’ve seen in the past when we drop strong\\n \\ncatalog content (Starz and Epix with Sony, Disney, and Paramount films, or 2nd run series from Fox, for\\n \\nexample) our members shift over to enjoying our other great content.\\n \\n \\nForty of our original series, films and specials were nominated for 117 Emmy Awards, including\\n \\nOutstanding Comedy and Drama Series, Limited Series, Animated Series and Reality Series, as well as\\n \\nVariety, Children’s, short form and interactive programs. We are incredibly proud to offer best in class\\n \\noriginal programming in so many different forms.\\n \\nMarketing\\n \\nAs Netflix has shifted to original content, our marketing has evolved to increasingly focus on launching\\n \\nour key titles to build excitement amongst existing and non-members. We’re continuing to invest in\\n \\nowned and earned media, where we can have strong, direct relationships with fans. We’re very excited\\n \\nto welcome \\n\\u200b\\nJackie Lee-Joe\\n\\u200b\\n as our new CMO to help us take our marketing to the next level.\\n \\n \\nWe’re also building out our licensing and brand partnerships effort, which is optimizing for fan and\\n \\nviewer engagement over revenue maximization. For example, for the launch of \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n season\\n \\n3, we partnered with best-in-class brands like \\n\\u200b\\nCoke\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nNike\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nBurger King\\n\\u200b\\n, and \\n\\u200b\\nBaskin Robbins\\n\\u200b\\n to build deep\\n \\nconnections with our fans.\\n \\nAt E3, the largest video gaming event of the year, we announced a new \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n mobile game, a\\n \\ngame based on our upcoming new show \\n\\u200b\\nDark Crystal: Age of Resistance \\n\\u200b\\n(a prequel to the 1982 film),\\n \\nand a partnership with Epic Games, the developers of \\n\\u200b\\nFortnite\\n\\u200b\\n. Like our other merchandising initiatives,\\n \\nthese games are designed to build fandom for our titles and don’t signal a push into gaming as a new\\n \\nbusiness for Netflix.\\n \\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe recently entered into a new partnership with AT&T in the US to integrate Netflix into their new\\n \\nset-top box. In the US, we now partner with a wide range of ISPs and MVPDs, including Comcast, DISH,\\n \\nVerizon, T-Mobile, Charter, and Altice, in addition to AT&T.\\n \\nAfter several months of testing, we’ve decided to roll out a lower-priced mobile-screen plan in India to\\n \\ncomplement our existing plans. We believe this plan, which will launch in Q3, will be an effective way to\\n \\nintroduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market\\n \\nwhere Pay TV ARPU is low (below $5). We will continue to learn more after launch of this plan.\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nOver the next 12 months, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, NBCU and others are joining Hulu, Amazon, BBC,\\n \\nHotstar, YouTube, Netflix, and many others in offering streaming entertainment. The competition for\\n \\nwinning consumers’ relaxation time is fierce for all companies and great for consumers. The innovation\\n \\nof streaming services is also drawing consumers to shift more and more from linear television to\\n \\nstreaming entertainment. If you watch \\n\\u200b\\nOur Planet\\n\\u200b\\n on a new TV with Dolby Vision or HDR10, you will see\\n \\nwhy: the quality of streaming television is spectacular. In the US, our most developed market, we still\\n \\nonly earn about 10% of consumers’ television time, and less of their mobile screen time, so we have\\n \\nmuch room for growth.\\n \\nWe, like HBO, are advertising free. That remains a deep part of our brand proposition; when you read\\n \\nspeculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be confident that this is false. We believe we will\\n \\nhave a more valuable business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue and instead\\n \\nentirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash used in operating activities in Q2’19 was -$544 million vs. -$518 million in the prior year period.\\n \\nFree cash flow (FCF)\\n totaled -$594 million vs. -$559 million in Q2’18. We’re still forecasting FCF of\\n \\n1\\napproximately -$3.5 billion for the full year 2019 and expect improvement in 2020. From there, we’ll\\n \\ncontinue to reduce our free cash flow deficit as we intend to continue growing our member base,\\n \\nrevenues, and operating margin, which provides a clear path towards positive FCF. In the meantime, our\\n \\nplan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments as we did in April. In our most recent\\n \\nround, we raised 10.5 year senior notes of \\n€\\n1.2 billion (3.875% coupon) and $900 million (5.375%\\n \\ncoupon).\\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2018\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nJuly 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2018\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2017\\n\\u200b\\n,  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2017\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the\\n \\nreconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.\\n \\n5\\n \\nAppendix\\n \\n \\nJuly 17, 2019 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST\\n \\nOur video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm\\n \\nPST today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are\\n \\nimportant liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated\\n \\nthat is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the\\n \\namount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\n6\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of\\n \\nthese non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial\\n \\nstatements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding future content offerings and evolution of our content\\n \\nmix; marketing investments; factors impacting our marginal growth; impact of competition; new pricing\\n \\nplans; remaining an advertising free service; future capital raises; US paid membership growth; US and\\n \\ninternational streaming paid memberships, paid net additions, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and\\n \\ncontribution margin; consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net\\n \\nincome, and earnings per share; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are\\n \\nsubject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without\\n \\nlimitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete\\n \\neffectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer\\n \\nusage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,\\n \\ncompetition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.\\n \\nA detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and\\n \\nevents to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the\\n \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities\\n \\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC\\n \\non February 8, 2019.

       "  'content': \"October 20, 2020\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\nAs we expected, growth has slowed with 2.2m paid net adds in Q3 vs. 6.8m in Q3’19. We think this is\\n \\nprimarily due to our record first half results and the pull-forward effect we described in our April and\\n \\nJuly letters. In the first nine months of 2020, we added 28.1m paid memberships, which exceeds the\\n \\n27.8m that we added for all of 2019. In these challenging times, we’re dedicated to serving our\\n \\nmembers.\\n \\n \\nQ3 Results and Q4 Forecast\\n \\nQ3 average streaming paid memberships rose 25%, while streaming ARPU decreased 1.6% year over\\n \\nyear. Excluding a foreign exchange (F/X) impact of -$158m, streaming ARPU increased 1% vs. prior year.\\n \\nRevenue was 2% above our beginning-of-quarter guidance primarily due to slightly higher than expected\\n \\nARPU (favorable plan mix in our UCAN, LATAM and APAC regions plus intra-quarter appreciation in the\\n \\nEuro and British pound which helped lift EMEA ARPU).  As a result, operating margin of 20% (up 170bps\\n \\nyear over year) exceeded our guidance forecast as well. EPS of $1.74 vs. $1.47 a year ago included a\\n \\n$249m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which\\n \\naccounted for the variance with our EPS guidance.\\n \\n \\nWe added 2.2m net memberships in Q3, compared with our 2.5m guidance. Retention remains healthy\\n \\nand engagement per member household was up solidly year over year in Q3’20. As a reminder, our\\n \\n1\\n \\nguidance is our internal forecast and we strive for accuracy. That means in some quarters our results will\\n \\nbe high relative to our guidance forecast and, in others, it will be low.\\n \\n \\nOur APAC region was the largest contributor to our paid membership growth this quarter (46% of Q3\\n \\nglobal paid net adds) and APAC revenue rose 66% year over year. We’re pleased with the progress we’re\\n \\nmaking in this region and, in particular, that we’ve achieved double digit penetration of broadband\\n \\nhomes in both South Korea and Japan. While this is encouraging, we still have much work to do and\\n \\nwe're working hard to replicate this success in India and other countries.\\n \\n \\nFor Q4‘20, we forecast 6.0m paid net adds vs 8.8m in Q4‘19. As we have highlighted in our recent\\n \\ninvestor letters, we believe our record first half paid net additions would result in slower growth in the\\n \\nback half of this year. If we achieve our forecast, it will put us at a record 34m paid net adds for 2020,\\n \\nwell above our prior annual high of 28.6m in 2018.\\n \\nThe state of the pandemic and its impact continues to make projections very uncertain, but as the world\\n \\nhopefully recovers in 2021, we would expect that our growth will revert back to levels similar to\\n \\npre-COVID. In turn, we expect paid net adds are likely to be down year over year in the first half of 2021\\n \\nas compared to the big spike in paid net adds we experienced in the first half of 2020. We continue to\\n \\nview quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not that meaningful in the context of the long\\n \\nrun adoption of internet entertainment, which we believe is still early and should provide us with many\\n \\nyears of strong future growth as we continue to improve our service.\\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nWe forecast Q4 operating margin of 13.5% vs. 8.4% last year, which means we’ll over-deliver this year\\n \\non our original full year margin target; our FY20 operating margin is now expected to be 18% (vs. 16%\\n \\noriginally) or a 500 basis point increase year over year. Since 2016, we will have more than quadrupled\\n \\nour annual GAAP operating margin (which is our primary profitability metric).\\n \\n \\nAs in the past, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year and at an average rate of\\n \\n300 basis points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate more lumpiness. Some years we’ll\\n \\nbe a little over (like this year when we expect to grow operating margin 500bps), some years a little\\n \\nunder, but we are trying to keep on a 300 bps per year long-term trajectory. The increased lumpiness is\\n \\ndue to increased F/X exposure from our international success and COVID’s impact on the timing of\\n \\nspending. By moving to this multi-year model, we’ll be able to manage our short term expenses more\\n \\nsmoothly as well as grow slightly more efficiently than in the past. As we wrote last quarter, for 2021,\\n \\nwe’re targeting a 19% operating margin.\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nWe are making good and careful progress returning to production, particularly in EMEA and APAC, but\\n \\nalso across much of LATAM and UCAN. We’ve restarted production on some of our biggest titles\\n \\nincluding season four of \\n\\u200b\\nStranger Things\\n\\u200b\\n, action film \\n\\u200b\\nRed Notice\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot\\n \\nand Ryan Reynolds) and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Witcher\\n\\u200b\\n season two. Since the almost-global shutdown of production back\\n \\nin mid-March, we have already completed principal photography on 50+ productions and, while the\\n \\ncourse and impact of C-19 remains unpredictable, we’re optimistic we will complete shooting on over\\n \\n150 other productions by year-end.\\n \\nFor our 2021 slate, we continue to expect the number of Netflix originals launched on our service to be\\n \\nup year over year in each quarter of 2021 and we’re confident that we’ll have an exciting range of\\n \\nprogramming for our members, particularly relative to other entertainment service options. As\\n \\n3\\n \\ndiscussed last quarter, some of our most popular returning titles are expected to launch in the second\\n \\nhalf of next year.\\n \\n \\nThis past quarter, the breadth of our programming was demonstrated with standout titles across many\\n \\ngenres. In English language series, we debuted new seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Umbrella Academy \\n\\u200b\\nand \\n\\u200b\\nLucifer\\n\\u200b\\n; 43m\\n \\nand 38m member households chose to watch these titles in the first 28 days, respectively. In\\n \\nmid-September, we also premiered Ryan Murphy’s \\n\\u200b\\nRatched\\n\\u200b\\n, a thriller based on the character from \\n\\u200b\\nOne\\n \\nFlew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest\\n\\u200b\\n. In its first four weeks, 48m member households chose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nRatched\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\nOur #1 and #2 most watched documentary feature films ever were released in Q3.  \\n\\u200b\\nAmerican Murder:\\n \\nThe Family Next Door\\n\\u200b\\n is projected to have 52m members households choose the title in its first 28 days\\n \\nand \\n\\u200b\\nThe Social Dilemma\\n\\u200b\\n had 38m in its first 28 days.\\n \\n \\nWe continue to invest heavily in local language content because we believe that great stories are\\n \\nuniversal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Season one of the Mexican\\n \\ntelenovela \\n\\u200b\\nOscuro Deseo\\n\\u200b\\n (\\n\\u200b\\nDark Desire\\n\\u200b\\n) was our biggest local language original globally this quarter. Our\\n \\nslate of Korean dramas continue to travel well throughout APAC and beyond, while anime is another\\n \\ncategory of content with fans all over the world.\\n \\n \\nAnother example of our content traveling around the globe is our non-fiction series \\n\\u200b\\nIndian\\n \\nMatchmaking\\n\\u200b\\n, which was watched by a quarter of our members in India and millions of members\\n \\noutside of India in its first four weeks.\\n \\n \\nOriginal film continues to be an area of opportunity for us and we had several big hits in Q3. Action\\n \\nthriller \\n\\u200b\\nThe Old Guard\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Charlize Theron and \\n\\u200b\\ndirected by Gina Prince-Bythewood\\n\\u200b\\n) was our most\\n \\npopular title of the quarter with 78m member households choosing to watch in its first four weeks. Our\\n \\nromantic comedy \\n\\u200b\\nThe Kissing Booth 2\\n\\u200b\\n received strong reception (66m member households chose to\\n \\nwatch in the first 28 days), while action film \\n\\u200b\\nProject Power\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Jamie Foxx) was also very popular\\n \\n(75m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks). Late in September, we debuted \\n\\u200b\\nEnola\\n \\nHolmes\\n\\u200b\\n, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill as her famed detective brother. We estimate 76m\\n \\nmember households will have chosen this film in the first 28 days.\\n \\n \\nOur content successes highlight our ability to tap into our global audience of nearly 200m members and\\n \\nunderscore the notion that content is \\n\\u200b\\nd i s c o v e r e d\\n\\u200b\\n on Netflix. This applies not only to Netflix originals, but\\n \\nalso to second run programming, like \\n\\u200b\\nSchitt’s Creek\\n\\u200b\\n and earlier seasons of \\n\\u200b\\nLucifer\\n\\u200b\\n, both of which are very\\n \\npopular with our members. The latest example is \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai\\n\\u200b\\n (based on \\n\\u200b\\nThe Karate Kid\\n\\u200b\\n films), which\\n \\noriginally debuted on YouTube’s subscription service in May 2018 and recently launched on Netflix on\\n \\nAugust 28. In its first four weeks of release on Netflix, 50m member households chose to watch season\\n \\none, dramatically expanding its audience.\\n \\n \\nWe’re looking forward to season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai\\n\\u200b\\n premiering exclusively on Netflix on January 8, 2021. In\\n \\naddition to the recently released \\n\\u200b\\nThe Haunting of Bly Manor\\n\\u200b\\n (a follow up to the acclaimed \\n\\u200b\\nThe Haunting\\n \\nof Hill House\\n\\u200b\\n), season one of \\n\\u200b\\nEmily in Paris\\n\\u200b\\n and Adam Sandler’s latest film \\n\\u200b\\nHubie Halloween\\n\\u200b\\n, other\\n \\nnotable Q4 titles include our animated family film \\n\\u200b\\nOver the Moon\\n\\u200b\\n from legendary creator Glen Keane\\n \\n(premiering this weekend), season four of our award-winning series \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n and the first season of\\n \\nSelena\\n\\u200b\\n. We’ll also have a great slate of films, including \\n\\u200b\\nThe Midnight Sky\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by and starring George\\n \\n4\\n \\nClooney), \\n\\u200b\\nHillbilly Elegy\\n\\u200b\\n (from Ron Howard), \\n\\u200b\\nMa Rainey’s Black  Bottom\\n\\u200b\\n (with Viola Davis and Chadwick\\n \\nBoseman), \\n\\u200b\\nThe Christmas Chronicles 2\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\n(from Chris Columbus),  \\n\\u200b\\nJingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey\\n\\u200b\\n (with\\n \\nForest Whitaker), \\n\\u200b\\nMANK\\n\\u200b\\n (David Fincher’s first feature at Netflix) and Ryan Murphy’s \\n\\u200b\\nThe Prom\\n\\u200b\\n (starring\\n \\nMeryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden and Kerry Washington).\\n \\n \\nProduct and Partnerships\\n \\nWe strive to be a global entertainment service that can satisfy the needs of members all over the world.\\n \\nCommissioning and producing local language content is an important part of that. But we also invest\\n \\nheavily into improving our product, partnerships and overall consumer experience. For example, in India\\n \\nin Q3, we localized our service to support Hindi in our user interface.\\n \\n \\nWe’re also working with local partners like Reliance Jio, India’s largest mobile operator, where in Q3 we\\n \\nlaunched a bundle with their mobile and fiber broadband plans. As part of this broad partnership, we’ll\\n \\nintegrate Netflix with two of Jio’s set top boxes. We’ve also partnered with financial institutions in India\\n \\nto make payment processing easier and more seamless for our members, which we expect will have\\n \\nretention benefits. All of these initiatives are important and work in concert with our big investment in\\n \\nlocal originals to improve the Netflix experience for our members.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nCompetition for consumers’ time and engagement remains vibrant.  Linear television and other big\\n \\ncategories of entertainment, like video games and user generated content from YouTube and TikTok are\\n \\nall vying for consumers’ attention and are strong drivers of screen time usage.  We remain quite small\\n \\nrelative to overall screen time.\\n \\n \\nThis past quarter, we saw the debut of Comcast’s Peacock, which comes on the heels of the launch of\\n \\nHBO Max and Disney+. Disney’s recent management reorganization signals that it is embracing the shift\\n \\nto streaming entertainment. We’re thrilled to be competing with Disney and a growing number of other\\n \\n5\\n \\nplayers to entertain people; both consumers and content creators will benefit from our mutual desire to\\n \\nbring the best stories to audiences all over the world.\\n \\n \\nWe’ll continue to focus on pleasing our members and improving our service as quickly as possible so\\n \\nthat we can be everyone's first choice for online entertainment.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was +$1.3 billion vs. -$502 million in the prior year\\n \\nperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)\\n was positive for a third consecutive quarter at +$1.1b vs. -$551 million in\\n \\n1\\nQ3‘19. Year to date free cash flow is +$2.2 billion vs. -$1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2019.\\n \\n \\nAs productions increasingly restart, we expect Q4’20 FCF to be slightly negative and therefore, for the\\n \\nfull year 2020, we forecast FCF to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of\\n \\nbreak-even to positive. This change is due primarily to our higher operating margin expectation for 2020\\n \\nand the timing of cash spending on content. We expect our FCF profile over the coming years to\\n \\ncontinue to improve as we increase our profitability and our transition to the production of Netflix\\n \\noriginals (which requires more cash upfront vs. second run content) matures. For 2021, we currently\\n \\nexpect free cash flow to be -$1 billion to break-even.\\n \\nWith $8.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter plus our $750m credit facility\\n \\n(which is undrawn), our need for external financing is diminishing. As indicated last quarter, we don’t\\n \\nhave plans to access the capital markets this year.\\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2020\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2020\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2020\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nOctober 2019\\n\\u200b\\n,  \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2019\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2018\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer\\n \\nto the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes\\n \\nthereto.\\n \\n6\\n \\nRegional Breakdown\\n \\n \\nOctober 20, 2020 Earnings Interview, 3pm PT\\n \\nOur video interview with Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays Capital will be on \\n\\u200b\\nyoutube/netflixir\\n\\u200b\\n at 3pm\\n \\nPT today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are\\n \\nimportant liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated\\n \\nthat is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the\\n \\namount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these\\n \\nnon-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net\\n \\nincome, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or\\n \\nother financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of\\n \\nthese non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial\\n \\nstatements.\\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding the timing and business impact of the global recovery\\n \\nfrom the affects of the COVID-19 pandemic; future content offerings and the number and timing of such\\n \\nofferings; our content production schedules and return to production, including the course and impact\\n \\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on content production; watch metrics for certain titles; partnerships;\\n \\nadoption of internet entertainment; impact of competition; future capital raises and external financing\\n \\nneeds; global streaming paid members, paid net additions and membership growth; paid net additions,\\n \\nconsolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings\\n \\nper share; and free cash flow.

       "  'content': 'April 19, 2022\\nFellow shareholders,\\nOur revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show. Streaming iswinning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relativelyhigh household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts -combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streamingobscured the picture until recently. While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth - throughimprovements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing - we’ll beholding our operating margin at around 20%. Key to our success has been our ability to create amazingentertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewingthan our competitors. These are Netflix\\'s core strengths and competitive advantages. Together with ourstrong profitability, we believe we have the foundation from which we can both significantly improve,and better monetize, our service longer term.\\nGrowth Outlook\\nSince launching streaming in 2007, we’ve operated under the firm belief that internet-delivered, ondemand entertainment will supplant linear TV, and that this transition represents a once-in-a-generationopportunity to build a highly popular and profitable entertainment company. People love movies, TVshows and games; broadband and smart TV penetration continue to grow globally with more and moreconnected devices; and while hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world’sbroadband homes don’t yet, representing huge future growth potential.\\n1\\nIn the near term though, we’re not growing revenue as fast as we’d like. COVID clouded the picture bysignificantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021was due to the COVID pull forward. Now, we believe there are four main inter-related factors at work.\\nFirst, it’s increasingly clear that the pace of growthinto our underlying addressable market (broadbandhomes) is partly dependent on factors we don’t directly control, like the uptake of connected TVs (sincethe majority of our viewing is on TVs), the adoption of on-demand entertainment, and data costs. Webelieve these factors will keep improving over time, so that all broadband households will be potentialNetflix customers.\\nSecond, in addition to our 222m paying households,we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region. Account sharing as a percentage ofour paying membership hasn’t changed much over the years, but, coupled with the first factor, meansit’s harder to grow membership in many markets - an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth.\\nThird, competition for viewing with linear TV as wellas YouTube, Amazon, and Hulu has been robust forthe last 15 years. However, over the last three years, as traditional entertainment companies realizedstreaming is the future, many new streaming services have also launched. While our US televisionviewing share, for example, has been steady to up according to Nielsen, we want to grow that sharefaster. Higher view share is an indicator of higher satisfaction, which supports higher retention andrevenue.\\nSource: Nielsen. Note: Hulu and YouTube figures include their virtual MVPD services.\\nFourth, macro factors, including sluggish economicgrowth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events suchas Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID are likely having an impact aswell.\\n2\\nOur plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects ofNetflix - in particular the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our membersvalue most. On the content side, we’re doubling down on story development and creative excellence,which we see reflected in big Q1’22 TV hits likeBridgerton(627 million hours viewed for season 2*, our1\\nbiggest English language series in our history) andInventing Anna(512m hours viewed) - both from ourextremely successful partnership with Shonda Rhimes - and films likeTinder Swindler(166m hoursviewed, our biggest documentary film ever released) andThe Adam Project(233m hours viewed), whichcome on the back of our Q4 hitsRed NoticeandDon’tLook Up. On the product side, we recentlylaunched “double thumbs up” so members can better express what they truly love versus simply like -enabling us to continue to improve our personalized recommendations and overall experience.\\nThis focus on continuous improvement has served us well over the past 25 years - from our big battlewith Blockbuster nearly 20 years ago through the launch and growth of streaming, to the switch fromlicensed second run TV series and films to original programming, and our development from a domesticbusiness with primarily English language content to a global entertainment service. It’s why we are nowthe largest subscription streaming service in the world on all key metrics: paid memberships,engagement, revenue and profit.\\nAnother focus is how best to monetize sharing - the 100M+ households using another household’saccount. This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying ourservice. Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. Andwe\\'ve always tried to make sharingwithina member’shousehold easy, with features like profiles andmultiple streams. While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and howNetflix can be shared with other households. So early last year we started testing different approaches tomonetize sharing and, in March, introduced two newpaid sharing features, where current membershave the choice to pay for additional households, in three markets in Latin America. There’s a broadrange of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing. So while wewon’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity. As wework to monetize sharing, growth in ARM, revenue and viewing will become more important indicatorsof our success than membership growth.\\nOver the longer term, much of our growth will come from outside the US. Traditionally, USentertainment companies have viewed “international” as an export market for US content. But we sawlong ago that great stories can be made anywhere and loved everywhere - dramatically broadening thepool of creators with whom we can work, increasing the variety of our programming and better servinglocal tastes. To support this, we’ve been building out capabilities like creative development,personalization, and language presentation/localization. Netflix is now producing films and TV in morethan 50 countries with a high degree of integration in the local entertainment ecosystem resulting in thecreation of blockbusters from every region. In fact, three out of our six most popular TV seasons of alltime are non-English language titles:Squid Game,La Casa de PapelPart 4 andAll Of Us Are Dead, which\\n1Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with anasterisk), data is from launch date through April 17, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based onhours viewed atNetflix Top 10.\\n3\\nlaunched in Q1’22 and has accumulated 561m hours viewed in its first four weeks. So an important focusis working to extend our lead in this area.\\nOur goal is to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating income even faster (as we expandmargins) and generate growing positive free cash flow (FCF). During this period of slower revenuegrowth, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange (F/X), we aim to protect our profitability andmanage to a minimum operating margin roughly in line with current levels (i.e., this year’s 19-20%guidance). Once we’ve re-accelerated revenue growth, we’re committed to steadily growing ouroperating margin.\\nQ1 R esults and Q2 F orecast\\nOur 10% revenue growth in Q1’22 was driven by an 8% year over year increase in average streaming paidmemberships and 2% year over year growth in ARM.Excluding a F/X impact of -$280 million, year over2\\nyear revenue and ARM growth were +14% and +6%, respectively. Operating income of $2.0 billion wasabove our beginning of quarter forecast of $1.8 billion due to lower than projected content expense. EPSof $3.53 vs. $3.75 a year ago included a $162 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurementon our Euro denominated debt.\\nPaid net additions were -0.2m compared against our guidance forecast of 2.5m and 4.0m in the samequarter a year ago. The suspension of our service in Russia and winding-down of all Russian paidmemberships resulted in a -0.7m impact on paid net adds; excluding this impact, paid net additionstotaled +0.5m. The main challenge for membership growth is continued soft acquisition across allregions. Retention was also slightly lower relative to our guidance forecast, although it remains at a veryhealthy level (we believe among the best in the industry). Recent price changes are largely trackingin-line with our expectations and remain significantly revenue positive.\\nIn EMEA (-0.3M paid net adds, or +0.4m excluding the Russia impact), we saw a slowdown in ourbusiness in Central and Eastern Europe in March, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Paid netadditions in LATAM totaled -0.4M; similar to recent quarters, we believe a combination of forcesincluding macroeconomic weakness and our price changes (F/X neutral ARM grew 20% year over year)were a drag on our membership growth. UCAN paid net adds of -0.6M was largely the result of our pricechange which is tracking in-line with our expectations and is significantly revenue positive. We’re makinggood progress in APAC where we are seeing nice growth in a variety of markets including Japan, India,Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.For Q2’22, we forecast paid net additions of -2.0m vs. +1.5m in the year ago quarter. Our forecastassumes our current trends persist (such as slow acquisition and the near term impact of price changes)plus typical seasonality (Q2 paid net adds are usually less than Q1 paid net adds). We project revenue togrow approximately 10% year over year in Q2, assuming roughly a mid-to-high single digit year over year\\n2ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include salestaxes or VAT.\\n4\\nincrease in ARM on a F/X neutral basis. We still target a 19%-20% operating margin for the full year 2022,assuming no material swings in F/X rates from when we set this goal in January of 2022.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $923 million vs. $777 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flowamounted to $802 million vs.$692 million. We continue to expect to be free cash3\\nflow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond.\\nDuring the quarter, we completed two acquisitions (leading visual effects companyScanlineand gamingstudioBoss Fight Entertainment), which had a -$125million impact on cash. We also announced ourpurchase of Helsinki-based gaming companyNext Games.We’ve completed the tender offer and expectto complete the transaction in the second half of 2022.\\nWe finished Q1 with gross debt of $14.6 billion after repaying $700 million of our senior notes. We’renow within the top end of our gross debt target range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $6.0 billion, netdebt was $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter, equating to a 1.3x LTM leverage ratio. Given those uses4\\nof cash and our minimum cash target, we didn’t engage in share repurchase activity during the quarter.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nWe recently published our2021 ESG Report(March 30,2022). We’ve made good progress on ourclimatecommitmentsannounced last year - reducing or avoidingmore than 14,000 metric tons of emissions in2021. This enabled us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 footprint by more than 10% from what it otherwisewould have been and puts us on track to cut 45% of these emissions by 2030.\\nWe continue to develop our inclusion lens. In 2021, women made up 51.7% of our global workforce, up5\\nfrom 48.7% in 2020. Half of our US workforce (50.5%) is made up of people from one or more historicallyexcluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds, including Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern,Native American, and Pacific Islander. That’s upfrom 46.8% in the previous year. The number of US6\\nBlack employees increased from 8.6% to 10.7% and Black leadership increased from 10.9% to 13.3%. Thenumber of US Hispanic or Latino employees increased from 7.9% to 8.6%, and US Hispanic or Latinoleadership grew slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%.\\nAs noted in our last investor letter and our2022preliminary proxy, the board has decided to recommendto shareholders that Netflix evolve to a more standard large cap company governance structure.

       "  'content': \"April 17, 2017\\n \\n \\nFellow shareholders,\\n \\n \\nIn Q1, we surpassed $2.5 billion in quarterly streaming revenue and added 5 million members.  The\\n \\nopportunity provided to us by the growth of the global internet is gigantic and our plan is to keep\\n \\ninvesting as we increase membership, revenue and operating margins.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nQ1 Results and Q2 Forecast\\n \\n \\nThe quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report, and we strive for\\n \\naccuracy. In Q1, there were no substantial variations from our January guidance forecast.\\n \\n \\nDue to content (primarily \\n\\u200b\\nHouse of Cards \\n\\u200b\\nseason 5) moving from Q1 to Q2, we had higher operating\\n \\nmargins in Q1 (as forecasted) at 9.7% than our plan for the year (about 7%).  We forecast operating\\n \\nmargin at 4.4% in Q2, placing us on track to reach our 7% target for the full year.\\n \\n \\nThe other effect of the content moves is lower net adds in Q1 compared to prior year (as expected) and\\n \\nheavier net adds in Q2 compared to prior year (about double).  We have come to see these quarterly\\n \\nvariances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV. For the first half of\\n \\nthis year, for example, we expect to have 8.15 million net adds, compared to 8.42 million net adds in the\\n \\nfirst half last year.\\n \\n \\nInternational net additions decreased 22% year over year, as we lapped our January 2016 launch of over\\n \\n130 countries, and the accompanying early surge demand, in Q1 2016. Revenue for the international\\n \\nsegment grew 62% year over year, excluding a -$12 million impact from currency, while ASP rose 12%\\n \\nyear over year on a F/X neutral basis. Q1 was the first quarter of consolidated profit for our international\\n \\nsegment as profit growth in our more mature territories offset investments in newer markets.  Our\\n \\nforward guidance shows that we intend to continue to invest internationally, projecting a small loss for\\n \\nQ2.\\n \\nWe have high satisfaction and are rapidly growing in Latin America, Europe, and North America. We are\\n \\nmaking good strides in improving our content offering to match local tastes in Asia, Middle East, and\\n \\nAfrica, but have much progress to make, like in Latin America a few years ago.\\n \\n \\nOur year-over-year streaming revenue growth is benefiting from a price change in mid 2016, and will\\n \\nmoderate over the course of the year to track membership growth more closely. We are seeing a small\\n \\nbut steady migration to our 4-stream, 4K-UHD-HDR video quality tier, which is our high end plan. That\\n \\nwill keep revenue growth slightly above membership growth, holding F/X constant.\\n \\n \\nFor the last several years we’ve had flat operating margins due to established markets funding\\n \\ninternational expansion with every spare dollar we had. Because of that, the major indicators of our\\n \\nprogress were member and revenue growth and US contribution margins. Starting this year, we can be\\n \\nprimarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics. The\\n \\nsummary table above has been reorganized to reflect that, while maintaining comparability to the past.\\n \\n \\nContent\\n \\nWith a growing member base spread across the world, we seek to please diverse tastes with a wide\\n \\nbreadth of content. The key releases this past quarter highlight this range of programming: \\n\\u200b\\nA Series of\\n \\nUnfortunate Events\\n\\u200b\\n, a dark comedy for the entire family, \\n\\u200b\\nSanta Clarita Diet\\n\\u200b\\n, a “zom-com” starring Drew\\n \\nBarrymore and \\n\\u200b\\nUltimate Beastmaster\\n\\u200b\\n, our first competition show which pits athletes from around the\\n \\nglobe against a fearsome 600-foot obstacle course.\\n \\n2\\n \\nIn addition to these titles, on March 17, we debuted \\n\\u200b\\nMarvel’s Iron Fist\\n\\u200b\\n, which has quickly become\\n \\nanother highly viewed Marvel series, and sets the stage for \\n\\u200b\\nThe Defenders\\n\\u200b\\n, which brings together all the\\n \\ncharacters from the Marvel series later this year. A week later, we launched \\n\\u200b\\nIngobernable\\n\\u200b\\n, our second\\n \\nMexican series, starring Kate del Castillo, which has been very popular in Mexico. On the last day of Q1,\\n \\nwe unveiled \\n\\u200b\\n13 Reasons Why\\n\\u200b\\n. Below is global search volume for several of our big launches over the last\\n \\nyear.\\n \\n \\n \\nWe have also stepped up our investment in stand up comedy which we believe can help grow our\\n \\nbusiness, like our original series. Early results are promising; the triumphant return of a comedy legend\\n \\nin \\n\\u200b\\nDave Chappelle: Collection 1\\n\\u200b\\n was our most viewed comedy special ever. We are also finding this to be\\n \\ntrue in international markets as well, with comedian Gad Elmaleh’s \\n\\u200b\\nGad Gone Wild\\n\\u200b\\n, a breakout hit in\\n \\nFrance last quarter.\\n \\nJust ahead of the release of our third film from Adam Sandler, \\n\\u200b\\nSandy Wexler\\n\\u200b\\n, we announced the renewal\\n \\nof our deal with Sandler to premiere an additional four films exclusively on Netflix around the world. We\\n \\ncontinue to be excited by our Sandler relationship and our members continue to be thrilled with his\\n \\nfilms. Since the launch of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Ridiculous 6\\n\\u200b\\n, Netflix members have spent more than half a billion hours\\n \\nenjoying the films of Adam Sandler.\\n \\n \\nWe recently hired \\n\\u200b\\nScott Stuber\\n\\u200b\\n to lead our original films initiative. Our goal remains the same: to offer a\\n \\nvariety of new movies that will attract and delight members at better economics relative to licensing\\n \\nmovies under traditional windowing. Some of our early movies have been successful by this measure,\\n \\nsuch as the Sandler movies and \\n\\u200b\\nSiege of Jadotville\\n\\u200b\\n. Others, such as \\n\\u200b\\nCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon:\\n \\nSword of Destiny\\n\\u200b\\n, have not.  Scott’s mandate is to increase both the portfolio and the percentage of\\n \\nfilms that delight many of our members relative to the film’s cost.\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nSince our members are funding these films, they should be the first to see them. But we are also open to\\n \\nsupporting the large theater chains, such as AMC and Regal in the US, if they want to offer our films,\\n \\nsuch as our upcoming Will Smith film \\n\\u200b\\nBright\\n\\u200b\\n, in theatres simultaneous to Netflix. Let consumers choose.\\n \\n \\nProduct\\n \\nAs always, our product team has dozens of tests running in the endless quest for even higher member\\n \\nsatisfaction. One test that won conclusively last year and has now been rolled out to all members is our\\n \\nnew “thumbs-up thumbs-down” feedback model, replacing the 5-star model we have had from our DVD\\n \\ndays. The amount of usage we get with this new approach is over twice as many ratings.  With this\\n \\nadditional personal input, we’ll be able to improve personalization, making your front screen on Netflix\\n \\neven more relevant.\\n \\n \\nA multi-year effort ahead is to have video replace still images in our user experience in ways that please\\n \\nour members and help them choose what to watch. Video for choosing video is an obvious direction, but\\n \\ndoing it well through our interface takes judgment, creativity, and testing.\\n \\nIn April, we will add Thai and later in the quarter, Romanian and Hebrew, to the 24 languages we\\n \\ncurrently support.\\n \\n \\nMarketing\\n \\nAs our slate of content expands, we’ll spend over $1 billion in 2017 marketing our content to drive\\n \\nmember acquisition. As part of this, we are investing more in programmatic advertising with the aim of\\n \\nimproving our ability to do individualized marketing at scale and to deliver the right ad to the right\\n \\nperson at the right time. Buttressing this activity is the substantial earned media coverage around the\\n \\nNetflix brand, technology and content we generate globally through events and activities aimed at\\n \\njournalists and social media influencers. We also market our content extensively to members through\\n \\nour service and with our partners. For instance, we participated in Comcast’s Watchathon in April,\\n \\nproviding X1 subscribers unlimited access to Netflix for a week.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nOur investors often ask us about ecosystem change, such as the advent in the US of virtual MVPDs (like\\n \\nSling, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, YouTube TV and Hulu’s forthcoming service). We believe VMVPDs\\n \\nwill likely be more directly competitive to existing MVPD services since they offer a subset of the same\\n \\nchannels at $30-$60 per month, and may appeal to a segment of the population that doesn’t subscribe\\n \\nto a pay TV bundle. But we don’t think it will have much of an impact on us as Netflix is largely\\n \\ncomplementary to pay TV packages. Our focus also is on on-demand, commercial free viewing rather\\n \\nthan live, ad-supported programming.\\n \\n \\nAdditionally, investors ask us about Amazon’s move into NFL football.  That is not a strategy that we\\n \\nthink is smart for us since we believe we can earn more viewing and satisfaction from spending that\\n \\nmoney on movies and TV shows.\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nFree cash flow in Q1’17 was -$423 million vs. -$261 million in the year ago quarter and an improvement\\n \\nfrom -$639 million in Q4’16. The growth in our original content means we continue to plan to have\\n \\naround $2B in negative FCF this year.\\n \\n \\nWe have a large market opportunity ahead of us and we’re optimizing long-term FCF by growing our\\n \\noriginal content aggressively. Negative near-term FCF is the result of the big increases in our original\\n \\ncontent, combined with small but growing operating margins. Since we want our operating margins to\\n \\ngrow slowly so we can spend enough to quickly grow revenue and original content, we anticipate\\n \\nnegative FCF to accompany our rapid growth for many years. Our operating margins are our key\\n \\nindicator of improving global profitability; they are already growing and we plan to keep them growing\\n \\nfor many years ahead. Eventually, at a much larger revenue base, original content and revenue growth\\n \\nwill be slower, and we anticipate substantial positive FCF, like our media peers.\\n \\nOur debt to total cap ratio, at under 10%, is quite conservative compared to most of our media peers at\\n \\n30-70%, and conservative compared to efficient capital structure theory. Thus we will continue to add\\n \\nlong-term debt as needed to finance our expansion of original content, including in Q2’17.\\n \\n \\nReference\\n \\nFor quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary 2017\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2016\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n \\nApril 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJanuary, 2016\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nOctober 2015\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nJuly 2015\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nApril 2015\\n\\u200b\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSummary\\n \\nWe remain incredibly excited about the opportunity in front of us to build a truly global and durable\\n \\ninternet TV business.

However, these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nshould be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,\\n \\ndiluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures\\n \\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures\\n \\nare contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding the company’s business opportunity, balancing\\n \\ncontribution profit and investment in the service, localization efforts, operating margins, plans to invest\\n \\nin growth; product initiatives; marketing spend; impacts on our business from competition; localization\\n \\nefforts; content strategy, including local content, original and licensed content investments; use of\\n \\ncapital; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue;\\n \\ncontribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and\\n \\ninternational operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income,\\n \\nearnings per share and free cash flow.

We finishedQ1’21 with 208m paid memberships, up 14% yearover year, but below our guidance forecast of 210mpaid memberships. We believe paid membershipgrowth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forwardin 2020 and a lighter content slate in the firsthalf ofthis year, due to Covid-19 production delays. We continueto anticipate a strong second half with thereturn of new seasons of some of our biggest hitsand an exciting film lineup. In the short-term, thereissome uncertainty from Covid-19; in the long-term,the rise of streaming to replace linear TV aroundtheworld is the clear trend in entertainment.\\nQ1 R esults and Q2 F orecast\\nAverage revenue per membershiprose 6% year overyear, or 5%, excluding a foreign exchange impact of1\\n+$80m. Operating income of $2 billion vs. $958 millionmore than doubled vs. Q1’20. This exceeded ourguidance forecast primarily due to the timing of contentspend. EPS of $3.75 vs. $1.57 a year agoincluded a $253m non-cash unrealized gain from F/Xremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\nThe extraordinary events of Covid-19 led to unprecedentedmembership growth in 2020, as it pulledforward growth from 2021, and delayed production acrossevery region. In turn, we ended 2020 with abigger membership and revenue base than we would otherwisehave had, contributing to record Q1’21revenues. And since we were still ramping productionlevels late last year, we had lower content spendin\\n1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number ofstreaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesalestaxes or VAT.\\n1\\nQ1’21 - content amortization only grew 9.5% year over year in Q1’21 vs. 17% in FY20. The result was a 10percentage point year over year jump in our operatingmargin to 27% in Q1, which is an all-time high.\\nAs we discussed in past letters, these dynamics arealso contributing to a lighter content slate in thefirsthalf of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth. In Q1, paid net additions of 4m werebelow our 6m guidance (and the 16m net additions inthe year ago quarter) primarily due to acquisition,as retention in Q1 was in line with our expectations.We don’t believe competitive intensity materiallychanged in the quarter or was a material factor inthe variance as the over-forecast was across allof ourregions. We also saw similar percentage year-over-yeardeclines in paid net adds in all regions (see ourRegional Breakdown table below), whereas the levelof competitive intensity varies by country.\\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report.That means in some quarters our results will be highrelative to our guidance forecast and, in others,itwill be low, as can be seen in the chart below. Asour membership base continues to grow, there willnaturally be more volatility in our absolute paidnet additions performance vs. forecast.\\nWith similar pull forward and delayed slate dynamicsplus our typical seasonality expected to impactQ2’21, we project paid net additions of 1m (vs. 10min the prior year quarter) with our UCAN and LATAMregions expected to be roughly flattish in memberships(+/- a couple hundred thousand paid net adds).We anticipate paid membership growth will re-acceleratein the second half of 2021 as we ramp into avery strong back half slate with the return of bighits likeSex Education,The Witcher,La Casa dePapel(akaMoney Heist), andYou, as well as an excitingarray of original films including the finale toTheKissingBoothtrilogy and large scale, star-driven featureslikeRed Notice(starring Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnsonand Ryan Reynolds) andDon’t Look Up(with an all-starcast including Leonardo DiCaprio, JenniferLawrence, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and MerylStreep). We’ll also have our mostcomprehensive offering to date of local language titlesincludingToo Hot to Handlefor Brazil and Mexico,\\n2\\na special based on our Korean hit franchiseKingdom, the action-thrillerDhamaka(India), as well as newseasons ofSintonia(Brazil), andControl Z(Mexico).\\nAs always, we’re focusing on the fundamentals of ourbusiness, which remain healthy. In addition to ourrecord financial results, engagement per member householdgrew solidly year over year in Q1’21. We’realso seeing how much members value Netflix with Q1’21churn below Q1‘20 levels, demonstrating thatas we improve the service, we can charge a bit more.Our FY21 operating margin target of 20% vs. 18%last year remains unchanged. We are optimistic aboutthe future and believe we are still in the earlydaysof the adoption of internet entertainment, which shouldprovide us with many years of growth ahead.\\nContent\\nAs seen in the weekly growth chart above, in earlyQ1, with the benefit ofBridgerton,LupinandCobraKai, we were following a growth trajectory similarto recent years. As we’ve noted previously, theproduction delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will leadto a 2021 slate that is more heavily second halfweighted with a large number of returning franchises.And while the roll out of vaccines is very unevenacross the world, we are back up and producing safelyin every major market, with the exception ofBrazil and India. Assuming this continues, we’ll spendover $17 billion in cash on content this year andwe’ll continue to deliver an amazing range of titlesfor our members with more originals this year thanlast.\\nThere are several facets to our content strategy.First and foremost, we want to deliver a wide varietyofbest-in-class stories that our members love and watchin big numbers. Examples of this breadth in Q1include season one ofFirefly Lane(49m chose to watchthis title in its first 28 days), season 3 ofCobraKai(45m),Fate: The Winx Saga(57m), andGinny &Georgia(52m). Our top movies in Q1 includeI CareALot(56m),YES DAY(62m),Outside the Wire(66m) andthe last installment ofTo All the Boys I’ve Loved\\n3\\nBeforetrilogy (51m). We program across many genres because tastes are very diverse. Even for oneperson, what they desire will vary widely dependingon their mood or who they are watching with.\\nAnother goal is to create great, locally authenticstories in countries all around the world. It’s whyourpriority for local language titles is to have a bigimpact in the home territory so we don’t sacrificelocalimpact for “travelability.” But we’re increasinglyseeing that these local titles find significant audiencesaround the world, which supports our thesis that greatstories are universal: they can come fromanywhere and be loved everywhere. Notable standoutsthis quarter includeBelow Zerofrom Spain (47mchose to watch in its first four weeks),Space Sweepersfrom Korea (26m),Squared Lovefrom Poland(31m) andWho Killed Sara?from Mexico (an estimated55m), which is also our most popularnon-English title ever in the US in its first 28 days(with season 2 launching on May 19).\\nWe want our titles to be talked about by audiencesacross the globe. Because of our broad distributionand highly engaged members, our titles not only generatehigh levels of viewing but also can pierce thecultural zeitgeist and transcend the film and TV industry.There were two recent standout examples ofthis:Lupin, our French language series about a daringgentleman burglar played by Omar Sy, was notonly our most popular new title this quarter on Netflix(76m member households chose to watch in thefirst 28 days), but it alsopropelled book salesofthe novel in France;Lupin: Part 2will debut laterinQ2’21. Similarly, driven by the late December launchof season one ofBridgerton, Julia Quinn’s bookshitThe New York Timesbestseller list for the first timein 18 years.\\nNetflix led all studios for recent award nominationsincluding the Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG Awards,BAFTA and the NAACP Image Awards, among others. Headinginto the Academy Awards this weekend,we have 36 nominations across 17 films including twonominees in each of the Best Picture (Mank,TheTrial of the Chicago 7), Best Documentary Feature(Crip Camp,My Octopus Teacher), and Best AnimatedFeature (Over the Moon,A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon)categories.Mankled all films with 10nominations.\\nProduct\\nWe are constantly working to make it easier for membersto access and enjoy something they will love,regardless of their location or mood. In Q1, we launchedan opt-inDownloads for Youfeature for Android(with iOS coming soon) that automatically downloadsrecommended shows and movies onto amember\\'s mobile device, ensuring that they alwayshave something to watch irrespective ofconnectivity. Knowing that bandwidth and storage canbe precious, this feature tries to choose only themost relevant content to download.\\nThis quarter we also launchedFast Laughs, a mobilefeed of short comedy clips from Netflix favorites-it\\'s initially available in several countries includingthe US on iOS and will be on Android soon. Fortelevision viewers, this month we unveiled an updatedand improved experience for Kids Profile thatmore vividly and easilyconnects childrenwith theirfavorite titles and characters.\\n4\\nCompe tition\\nWe compete with many activities for consumers’ entertainmenttime, ranging from watching linear TV,video gaming, and viewing user generated content,just to name a few. Against this backdrop, theentertainment market is huge, giving us plenty ofroom to grow, if we can continue to improve ourservice. We believe we are less than 10% of TV screentime in the US and even smaller in other regionsand when including mobile devices.\\nMore and more new streaming services are launching,reinforcing our vision that linear TV will slowlygive way to streaming entertainment. Despite our 10+year head start, we are continually seekingoperational and creative excellence; we’re workingas hard as ever to continually improve our servicesothat we are the best entertainment option availablewith best in class stories, an ever-improving productexperience and authentic local titles that our memberslove. Our ability to evolve from a DVD-by-mail toan internet entertainment business, from a US-onlyto a global service, and from a licensor of secondwindow content to a producer of original content acrossso many different categories fuels ourconfidence and optimism for our next decade of challenges,growth and innovation.\\nWhen comparing services, subscriber figures alonetell only part of the story (given bundles, discountsand other promotions) so it’s important to also focuson engagement and revenue as key indicators ofsuccess; they drive the flywheel of investment ineven more amazing stories for our members and futuregrowth. It’s our job to please our members so muchon Monday, that on Tuesday, they start with us, andthen they stick with us as their first choice forentertainment.\\nCash Flo w and Capit al Structur e\\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was$777 million vs. $260 million in the prior yearperiod. Free cash flow (FCF)for the quarter was$692 million vs. $162 million in Q1‘20. We are ontrack2\\nfor full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximatelybreak even. As we discussed last quarter, we believewe are very close to being sustainably FCF positiveand that we no longer have a need to raise externalfinancing to fund our day-to-day operations.\\nDuring the quarter, we repaid our 5.375% February1, 2021 bond ($500 million principal) out of balancesheet cash, reducing our total gross debt balanceto $15.7 billion as of March 31, 2021. We intend tomaintain $10-$15 billion of gross debt. Our boardhas approved a program to repurchase up to $5 billionof our common stock beginning in 2021 with no fixedexpiration date. We expect our buyback programwill begin this quarter.\\nEnvironmen tal, Social, and Go vernance (E SG)\\nWe’ve added a new section to our investor relationssite that collates all of ourESG informationforourinvestors, including our recently published2020 ESGReport(filed March 30, 2021).

We’re enormously grateful that in\\n \\nthese uniquely challenging times we’ve been able to provide our members around the world with a\\n \\nsource of escape, connection and joy while continuing to build our business. With 8.5m paid net\\n \\nadditions in Q4, we crossed the 200m paid memberships mark. For the full year, we added a record 37m\\n \\npaid memberships, achieved $25 billion in annual revenue (+24% year over year) and grew operating\\n \\nprofit 76% to $4.6 billion. Our summary results and forecast are below.\\n \\n \\nQ4 Results and Q1 Forecast\\n \\nAverage paid streaming memberships increased 23% year over year in Q4, while average revenue per\\n \\nmembership\\n was flat year over year both on a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis.\\n \\n1\\nRevenue was 1% higher than our guidance forecast, as paid net adds exceeded our 6.0m projection by\\n \\n2.5m. Operating margin of 14.4% (a 600bps increase from Q4’19) also came in above our guidance, due\\n \\nto higher-than-expected revenue. EPS of $1.19 vs. $1.30 a year ago included a $258m non-cash\\n \\nunrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.\\n \\nFor the full year, our 37m paid net additions represented a 31% increase from 2019’s 28m paid net adds.\\n \\nWe’re becoming an increasingly global service with 83% of our paid net adds in 2020 coming from\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\u200b\\nAverage revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of\\n \\nstreaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period; it was previously referred to as\\n \\nstreaming ARPU. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT.\\n \\n1\\n \\n \\noutside the UCAN region. Our EMEA region accounted for 41% of our full year paid net adds, while APAC\\n \\nwas the second largest contributor to paid net additions with 9.3m (up 65% year over year).\\n \\n \\n \\nAs a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report\\n \\nand we strive for accuracy. For Q1’21, we expect paid net adds of 6.0m vs. last Q1’s 15.8m, which\\n \\nincluded the impact from the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. Since the start of 2018, our paid memberships\\n \\nhave risen from 111m to 204m and our average revenue per membership has grown from $9.88 to\\n \\n$11.02, despite significant F/X headwinds. This approach has allowed us to organically increase revenue\\n \\nby $4-$5 billion annually over the past several years.\\n \\n \\nWe’ve made good progress growing our profitability with FY20 operating margin of 18% rising five\\n \\npercentage points over prior year. For FY21, we’re now targeting a 20% operating margin, up two\\n \\npercentage points from 2020 and higher than our previous 19% forecast, due to a more favorable\\n \\nrevenue outlook. As we said last quarter, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year\\n \\nat an average rate of three percentage points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate some\\n \\nlumpiness. Some years we’ll be a little over (like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021), but we\\n \\nare trying to keep on an average three percentage points per year long-term trajectory.\\n \\nContent\\n \\nThe big growth in streaming entertainment has led legacy competitors like Disney, WarnerMedia and\\n \\nDiscovery to compete with us in new ways, which we’ve been expecting for many years. This is, in part,\\n \\nwhy we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a\\n \\nwide range of genres and nations. Our fourth quarter slate highlights the breadth and diversity of our\\n \\nentertainment offering.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nIn scripted English language television, season four of the critically acclaimed \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown\\n\\u200b\\n was the biggest\\n \\nseason so far and drove new watchers of prior seasons. In its first 28 days, more member households\\n \\nchose to watch season four of \\n\\u200b\\nThe Crown \\n\\u200b\\nthan each of the prior seasons, helping to grow the number of\\n \\nmember households that have chosen to watch this series to over 100m since its initial launch. In late\\n \\nDecember, we released our first original series from Shonda Rhimes, \\n\\u200b\\nBridgerton.\\n\\u200b\\n This title has proven\\n \\nimmensely popular and we’ll have some exciting news about \\n\\u200b\\nBridgerton\\n\\u200b\\n later this week.\\n \\n \\nOur largest original film of the quarter was \\n\\u200b\\nThe Midnight Sky\\n\\u200b\\n, starring and directed by George Clooney;\\n \\nwe estimate 72m member households will choose to watch this title in its first four weeks. In its first 28\\n \\ndays, 43m member households chose to watch our animated feature film \\n\\u200b\\nOver the Moon\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by\\n \\nlegendary creator Glen Keane) with high levels of rewatching. \\n\\u200b\\nWe Can Be Heroes\\n\\u200b\\n (directed by Robert\\n \\nRodriguez) was another successful family film with a projected 53m member households choosing this\\n \\ntitle in its first four weeks.\\n \\n \\nOur holiday movie slate also resonated with our members; in the first four weeks, 68m and 61m\\n \\nmember households chose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nHolidate\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Emma Roberts) and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Christmas Chronicles:\\n \\nPart Two \\n\\u200b\\n(starring Kurt Russell), respectively. Our first Portuguese language holiday film from Brazil, \\n\\u200b\\nJust\\n \\nAnother Christmas\\n\\u200b\\n (starring Leandro Hassum)\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n\\u200b\\n was also a big hit with 26m member households globally\\n \\nchoosing to watch in the first 28 days of release.\\n \\n \\nWe continue to ramp up our local original content slate. Our top local titles this quarter include\\n \\nBarbarians \\n\\u200b\\n(a historical action series from Germany that 37m member households globally chose to\\n \\nwatch in the first four weeks), \\n\\u200b\\nSweet Home\\n\\u200b\\n, our Korean language horror show (22m member\\n \\nhouseholds), \\n\\u200b\\nSelena: The Series\\n\\u200b\\n, which particularly resonated with members throughout Mexico and the\\n \\nUS (25m member households globally), and \\n\\u200b\\nAlice in Borderland\\n\\u200b\\n, a sci-fi thriller from Japan (18m member\\n \\nhouseholds). While designed to be very impactful in the home country, we see many cases of our local\\n \\noriginals traveling more broadly. For example, \\n\\u200b\\nLupin\\n\\u200b\\n, an adrenalin-filled French language heist series\\n \\nreleased in early January, has hit #2 in our US Top 10 list and ranked #1 in dozens of other countries\\n \\nincluding Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Vietnam, the Philippines and many more. We\\n \\nproject 70m member households will choose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nLupin\\n\\u200b\\n in its first 28 days of release.\\n \\nIn addition to titles with big viewership, we also aspire to have hits that become part of the cultural\\n \\nzeitgeist. In 2020 alone, we had \\n\\u200b\\nTiger King\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nBridgerton\\n\\u200b\\n and \\n\\u200b\\nThe Queen’s Gambit\\n\\u200b\\n. Not only did 62m\\n \\nmember households choose to watch \\n\\u200b\\nThe Queen’s Gambit\\n\\u200b\\n in its first 28 days (making this show our\\n \\nbiggest limited series in Netflix history), but it ignited\\n\\u200b\\n sales of chess sets\\n\\u200b\\n and inspired the next generation\\n \\nof chess prodigies. In fact, Netflix series accounted for nine out of the 10 most searched shows globally\\n \\nin 2020, while our films represented two of the top 10.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nGoogle Year in Search, 2020 (Global)\\n \\n \\nSource: Google. Note: \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai\\n\\u200b\\n seasons 1 & 2 originally debuted on YouTube Red. Season 3 is a Netflix original.\\n \\nOur productions are back up and running in most regions - we have learned that flexibility and\\n \\nadaptability are paramount in this fast-changing environment. With over 500 titles currently in post\\n \\nproduction or preparing to launch on our service and plans to release at least \\n\\u200b\\none new original film\\n \\nevery week in 2021\\n\\u200b\\n with extraordinary talent, we’re confident we’ll continue to have a great content\\n \\noffering for our members.\\n \\nIn Q1, in addition to the recently released season 3 of \\n\\u200b\\nCobra Kai \\n\\u200b\\nand\\n\\u200b\\n Lupin\\n\\u200b\\n, we’re excited to be launching\\n \\nlater this quarter \\n\\u200b\\nTo All the Boys I’ve Loved Before 3\\n\\u200b\\n, the finale to this beloved rom com trilogy, our\\n \\nyoung adult drama \\n\\u200b\\nFate: The Winx Saga\\n\\u200b\\n, \\n\\u200b\\nYes Day\\n\\u200b\\n (a family movie starring Jennifer Garner), \\n\\u200b\\nSky Rojo\\n\\u200b\\n, a\\n \\nthrilling new series from the creators of \\n\\u200b\\nLa Casa de Papel\\n\\u200b\\n (aka \\n\\u200b\\nMoney Heist\\n\\u200b\\n) and \\n\\u200b\\nSpace Sweepers\\n\\u200b\\n, an\\n \\naction packed Korean sci-fi film.\\n \\n \\nProduct\\n \\nLast year, we continued to improve our parental controls so that families have more control over their\\n \\nexperience. These enhancements include allowing members to filter out content at the title level or by\\n \\nmaturity rating, creating a profile lock PIN and customizing autoplay settings for any profile. We also\\n \\nextended parental control support to downloads to give parents peace of mind regardless of how Netflix\\n \\nis used. And we provided parents with more transparency into the themes, characters and content that\\n \\ntheir kids love with the Kids Activity Report, a weekly message designed to keep parents informed about\\n \\nthe content their children are watching.\\n \\nAs we bring our members more great programming, we’re always listening and working to make it\\n \\neasier for them to find the right show and film to watch. That’s why last year we debuted our Top 10\\n \\nlists around the world, and in October we introduced the New & Popular tab in our television user\\n \\ninterface, which includes a new Worth the Wait section, highlighting titles as far as a year away that you\\n \\ncan remind yourself about. As another exciting step in this effort, we’ve been testing a new feature that\\n \\n4\\n \\n \\ngives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse. The\\n \\nresponse has been positive and we plan to roll it out globally in the first half of 2021.\\n \\n \\nCompetition\\n \\nIt’s a great time to be a consumer of entertainment. There are a wealth of options ranging from linear\\n \\nTV to video gaming to user generated content on YouTube and TikTok. We continue to work hard to\\n \\ngrow our small share of screen time against these major competitors.\\n \\n \\nDiscovery\\n\\u200b\\n recently launched its streaming service. Disney+ is \\n\\u200b\\nexpanding\\n\\u200b\\n in new countries and with more\\n \\ncontent. ViacomCBS will be unveiling its plans for Paramount+ in 2021. Combined with the launch of\\n \\nAppleTV+, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming services, this signifies that\\n \\nthese companies all recognize the future is streaming entertainment, a vision we have been working\\n \\ntowards since inception.\\n \\n \\nOur strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members,\\n \\nwe can be their first choice for streaming entertainment. This past year is a testament to this approach.\\n \\nDisney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid\\n \\nmembership growth in our history.\\n \\n \\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\\n \\nNet cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$138 million vs. -$1.5 billion in the prior year\\n \\nperiod. Free cash flow\\n (FCF) for the quarter was -$284 million vs. -$1.7 billion in Q4‘19, bringing full year\\n \\n2\\n2020 free cash flow to +$1.9 billion vs. -$3.3 billion in 2019.\\n \\nWe believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive. For the full year 2021, we currently\\n \\nanticipate free cash flow will be around break even (vs. our prior expectation for -$1 billion to break\\n \\neven). Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750m undrawn credit facility, \\n\\u200b\\nwe believe\\n \\nwe\\n\\u200b\\n \\n\\u200b\\nno longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations.\\n\\u200b\\n Our 5.375%\\n \\nFebruary 1, 2021 bonds mature in Q1. We plan on repaying the bond at maturity out of cash on hand, as\\n \\nwe are currently well above our minimum cash needs.\\n \\n \\nAs we generate excess cash, we intend to maintain $10B-15B in gross debt and will explore returning\\n \\ncash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks, as we did in the past (2007-2011).\\n \\n \\nLong-Term Stock Price Performance\\n \\nWe thank our equity and debt investors for their trust and for coming along with us on our journey to\\n \\nbuild one of the world’s leading entertainment companies.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it\\n \\nmeasures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt\\n \\nobligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations,\\n \\nincluding investments in global streaming content. However, this non-GAAP measure should be\\n \\nconsidered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted\\n \\nearnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in\\n \\naccordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are\\n \\ncontained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\\n \\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\xa0\\nThis shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal\\n \\nsecurities laws, including statements regarding investment in our service; average revenue per\\n \\nmembership; future content offerings and the number and timing of such offerings; viewing metrics for\\n \\ncertain titles; product enhancements and offerings; future capital and external financing needs; debt\\n \\nrepayment; global streaming paid members, paid net additions and membership growth; consolidated\\n \\nrevenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and\\n \\nfree cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that\\n \\ncould cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new\\n \\nmembers and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion\\n \\nof device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions;\\n \\nproduction risks, including those related to the coronavirus pandemic; and, competition, including\\n \\nconsumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion\\n \\nof these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially\\n \\nfrom such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange\\n \\nCommission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange\\n \\nCommission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2020, as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\\n \\nquarter ended March 31, 2020.
