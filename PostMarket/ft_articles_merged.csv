The Wall Street rally “was very tech-driven and if you look at what the rest of the market did, it was pretty flat since the beginning of the year”, said Anthi Tsouvali, multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets.
“We talk about this euphoria, because we are reaching new highs [ . . . ] but at the end of the day it’s driven by a very small part of the market and that is why it could be very volatile if tech earnings are not as good as everyone expected,” she added.

After shocking investors by losing subscribers last year, Netflix has responded with two big steps: introducing a cheaper version of its service with advertisements, and trying to limit password sharing, a practice it had largely ignored when growth was high.
Netflix in May cracked down on password sharing for accounts in the US, UK and more than 100 other countries. In the US, Netflix has told customers that if they want to share their password, they must pay $7.99 a month to add a person outside their home, or $6.99 if they are prepared to have an account with adverts.
That policy appears to be working. In the three months to the end of June, Netflix added 5.9mn subscribers, well above Wall Street expectations for 2mn. “The cancel reaction was low,” the company told investors on Wednesday. 
However, shares in Netflix, which had gained more than 8 per cent in the five days leading up to the earnings release, dropped more than 8 per cent in post-market trading after the company reported softer revenue. 
Netflix’s quarterly revenue rose to $8.2bn, up 3 per cent from a year ago but just short of forecasts for $8.3bn. The company predicted that revenue would climb to $8.5bn in the current quarter, missing analysts’ forecasts for $8.7bn. 
Netflix’s password crackdown reflects the harsh realities of the costly streaming model that it has pioneered. When Wall Street was more keen on streaming, investors looked past the heavy losses companies were enduring, so long as they were able to keep adding subscribers quickly. 
But as the wider market has cooled, investors are more focused on profits. Competition has heated up, with Disney and others vying with Netflix for customers.

Netflix is profitable, while Disney+, Paramount+ and other rival streaming services are still losing money. Netflix on Wednesday reported quarterly net income of $1.5bn, up 3 per cent from the same period a year ago.

		of $5bn this year, up from its previous estimate of $3.5bn. 
Many workers have blamed Netflix for ushering in a streaming revolution that has made it difficult for screenwriters to make a decent living. On an earnings call, co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the strike was “not an outcome that we wanted”, while highlighting his father’s ties to unions. 
“On a personal level, I was raised in a union household. My dad was a member of IBEW Local 640, he was a union electrician . . . I remember on more than one occasion my dad being out on strike, and I remember that because it takes an enormous toll on your family, financially and emotionally,” he said.
Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said the results were “a strong endorsement” of Netflix’s password strategy, but cautioned that the crackdown was a “short-term measure”. Netflix “needs to consider its pricing strategy for the mid to long term”, he said. 
After tumbling last year, Netflix shares have made a comeback in 2023, gaining more than 60 per cent.
“While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth,” Netflix told shareholders in a letter.

		was advancing at a breathtaking pace. Entrepreneurs flocked to the area from around the world, including China and Russia, while US venture capitalists started investing in Chinese tech companies. Around the same time, American tech companies began using China as a major production base. Looking back, those were the “good old days”, when the distance between markets was shrinking rapidly.
“In the long history of international relations, the ‘good old days’ you experienced in the Valley are rare,” a former diplomat here in Singapore told me a few months back. He pointed to past examples of conflict between powerful nations, such as second world war and the cold war.
Unfortunately, he also had a current example: the growing tensions between the US and China.
Those tensions are raising tough questions for US tech companies. Many of them still depend on China for much of their sales, write Nikkei staff writers Akito Tanaka and Grace Li.
An analysis of financial data by Nikkei Asia shows that of the top 100 global companies in China by sales in the most recent fiscal year, 17 were US tech-related companies.
Apple topped the list, while Qualcomm, a major US chip company, depends on China for more than 60 per cent of its sales. Electric-car maker Tesla relies on China for over 20 per cent of its sales.
This dependence on China has changed little despite efforts at decoupling the two countries’ tech supply chains. Greater China remains Apple’s second-largest source of revenue, following the company’s home market. For Tesla, China’s importance has grown by leaps and bounds. In 2022 it made 22 per cent of its total sales in the country, up from 8 per cent in 2018.
Like the former diplomat who sees tension as more common than harmony in the global order, many analysts expect the US-China conflict to continue. Leaders of US tech companies whose strategy has been to court the Chinese market will have to “accept that a new status quo is forming”, according to one such expert.

		products, said people close to the regulators.
The update is part of regulations to be finalised as early as this month, according to people with knowledge of the move.
It contrasts with draft regulations issued in April that gave tech companies 10 working days to register their products once they had launched them. That document demands companies train their generative AI models with “veracity, accuracy, objectivity and diversity” and makes them almost fully responsible for the content their AI creates.
The latest move in China’s AI regulatory regime signals how the government is struggling to reconcile a desire to develop world-beating technologies with its longstanding censorship regime.
Beijing is keen to formalise its regulatory approach to generative AI before the technology — which can quickly create humanlike text, images and other content in response to simple prompts — becomes widespread.
China’s artificial intelligence boom is proving a strong pull for US companies, even as the two countries engage in tit-for-tat trade restrictions on tech-related goods and materials.
The recent World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai drew executives from Tesla, Microsoft and other big American companies looking to tap the country’s emerging AI market, write Nikkei staff writers Tomoko Wakasugi and Shunsuke Tabeta.
“I think there’s an immense number of very smart, very talented people in China,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a video message at the event. Google had a booth at the venue — despite its services being blocked in China — while executives from Microsoft appeared on stage.
US tech has its sights set on China despite the souring relationship between Washington and Beijing because of the potential scale of its AI market, which market researcher IDC forecasts to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to $26.4bn.
Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings once said in an interview with Nikkei that one of his favourite series is Midnight Diner, a show based on a Japanese manga.
Now, the company is investing heavily to create new content in Asian markets like South Korea, Japan and India, recruiting new partners and searching for emerging talent to capture audiences in the increasingly important region, write Nikkei staff writers Rei Nakafuji and Kotaro Hosokawa.
Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos visited Seoul last month and met with production company executives and creators as part of the trip. The company signed a five-year contract with Yuji Sakamoto, who won best screenplay for the film Kaibutsu (Monster) at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

https://www.ft.com/content/81a92e55-8b95-4378-8940-a42199c536f6,Danny Leigh,Wham! film review — larky Netflix documentary plays mostly the hits,2023-07-06,16:00:16,"Life can turn on the smallest twist of fate. In September 1975, awkward new boy Georgios Panayiotou arrived at Bushey Meads secondary school in Hertfordshire, just north of London; a cocksure pupil named Andrew Ridgeley volunteered as his guide. Had Ridgeley failed to put up his hand, the vastly successful pop duo Wham! may never have formed. And now, 48 years later, director Chris Smith would not have made a high-spirited documentary of the same name for Netflix.
But he did, they did, and Smith has too, setting out the comet-like story that ended barely a decade after that classroom encounter, with millions of records sold and Panayiotou transformed into the all-conquering George Michael.
The quick-fire narrative — a rise with no time for a fall — may be part of why the tale has had to wait so long to be told on-screen, unfolding in a 1980s Britain that can already feel as distant as the Moon. In their early days, the dole-queue anthem “Wham Rap!” saw the band tagged as social commentators, but really they were pop to their core. And the film follows their lead, a blend of larky archive and audio interviews, conducted at pace.
The breezy mood means Michael’s death in 2016 is left out of the picture; and crucial events get strictly rationed screen time. Still, Smith does outline the splash caused by 1983 single “Club Tropicana”, tied up with Thatcherism and coming Ibiza rave culture. More momentous yet were the groundbreaking 1985 concerts in China. Here we have to make do with a glimpse: the Chinese state and soon-to-be solo Michael united on the brink of new eras.

https://www.ft.com/content/dc79eecf-ed3c-486a-8b89-60c67b6ff10a,Daniel Thomas,Netflix to revamp advertising strategy to lure brands and boost revenues,2023-07-03,04:00:10,"Netflix will develop increasingly targeted and tailor-made advertising formats to win over marketing bosses as it seeks to boost revenues in its recently launched advertising supported service.
The US streaming service held talks with global advertising executives about new plans at this year’s Cannes Lions festival in the south of France after launching the ad-supported service last year. 
Advertising executives said innovations could include “episodic” campaigns that would see a series of different but related sequential ads to consumers, which would avoid the common complaint of consumers of being shown the same ad multiple times when watching a series. These could be shown during related shows — for example, light entertainment — but not others.
Netflix was a prominent presence at the vast festival of advertising in its first year at the event, hosting a party in a branded hotel on the seafront and an event with ex-footballer David Beckham. 
Netflix co-chief executive Greg Peters and Jeremi Gorman, president of worldwide advertising at Netflix, spent the week in France courting advertising bosses and brands, according to multiple advertising executives.
They said that their counterparts at Netflix outlined how the US media giant would introduce sophisticated ways for brands to advertise as part of a long-term strategy to redefine how streamers can use their platforms for commercial purposes. This includes allowing brands to more directly target advertising to consumers in ways not possible on linear TV channels.
One Hollywood marketing executive said that the partnership to use Microsoft’s technology was also likely to come to an end next year, which would allow Netflix greater ability to innovate. 
“They’re building [their own technology] in the background. Once they have their own they’ll do free standing. Microsoft is the interim ad server, but that’ll change when they build their own,” he said. 
“The plan for Netflix was just to get to market quickly last year. This is not the final way they’re going to do it. They are going to be very creative. There’s going to be a better, a different experience.”
One advertising boss said Netflix would be able to use its data on customers to create more bespoke marketing, albeit in ways still safeguarding customer data protections. 
“They’ll know what you’ve seen,” he said. “So the old days of making episodic work may be back because before you could never guarantee what people have seen already. Now you can write 15 episodes of an advert and guarantee that the viewer will see them in the right order. So that’s really interesting.”
Another advertising chief said Netflix now made more money per user on its advertising plans than in the standard tier. He said brands had been positive on the idea of using Netflix to market their products, although he added that the size of the audience was still small.
“Streaming services thought it would devalue their offer. But actually, it’s massively expanded the reach. Brands are extremely keen to be associated with the Netflix content and now they’re starting to think about much more innovation around the format, much more strategic partnerships.”
Another advertising executive said: “What level of targeting that they start to apply could get really, really interesting. We were keen for some of our brands to use it so that we could see what was coming [but] we can’t correlate exposure to Netflix to sales — it’s just too small. But you can get learning about who saw your ads.”
Netflix is also seeking to build out its gaming business to include advertising, noted another ad executive. Others added that they expected Apple to follow Netflix and introduce advertising alongside its shows and products. Netflix and Microsoft declined to comment.

https://www.ft.com/content/c84a495b-a0b1-4004-8a87-4bf48daaf01e,Dan Einav,Black Mirror Series 6 — is it time for the Netflix sci-fi satire to call it a day?,2023-06-15,10:56:23,"Fans of Black Mirror know to expect twists, but even they might be blindsided by creator Charlie Brooker’s decision to deviate from the show’s tried and tested formula. Instead of the usual collection of stories set in grimly plausible, tech-heavy, near-future dystopias, the new sixth season harks back to recent pasts, old myths and established storytelling traditions in tales where VHS tapes, digital cameras and even supernatural talismans find themselves at home.
But the shift may not seem so drastic if you consider that Black Mirror has always been less about technology than psychology; its anxious speculations about the misuse of tech house darker convictions about human nature. The latest season is consistent in compelling us to face up to our propensity for cruelty, exploitation and self-interest.
The show is also consistent in its continued decline. Though these five episodes boast strong casts, directorial flair and high-grade production, they often oversell their message and underwhelm when compared to earlier instalments. The opener “Joan is Awful” is an exception: a largely on-brand, imaginative chapter about Joan (Annie Murphy) whose indiscretion-filled life is turned into a glossy drama starring Salma Hayek on Streamberry (a mischievous Netflix spoof). Before the story loses itself in a soup of meta developments, the episode offers a nicely absurdist take on the recent vogue for bio-series that sensationalise and revel in real people’s humiliations in the name of entertainment.
It’s a theme that recurs again in the sinister but less inspired “Loch Henry”, which follows a young Scottish filmmaker who digs into a horrific crime that took place in his home village in the 1990s. “The details are so awful it’s irresistible,” says his partner. Ghoulish excitement soon gives way when juicy content turns uncomfortably personal. “Mazey Day”, a moral fable about a paparazzo (Zazie Beetz) hounding a troubled starlet, rounds off the informal triptych about our insatiable appetite for the misfortunes of others.
Recommended
Best of a frustratingly uneven bunch is the retro-futuristic sci-fi film “Beyond the Sea”. A pessimistic study of envy and a metaphysical meditation on mind and matter, it sees Aaron Paul skilfully play two very different astronauts who take turns transferring their consciousness into one “replica” body back on Earth.
The other feature-length offering, “Demon 79”, is a loving pastiche of ’70s B-movie horror. It might be the weakest chapter for those who don’t have a particular affection for the genre but it is also the clearest example of Brooker’s aim to stretch “the parameters of what a Black Mirror episode is”. An understandable and commendable instinct, but you wonder if his cynical brilliance might be better served working on a new project altogether. What was once the most daring, prescient show on TV now feels a little less incisive, a little less necessary.

Black Mirror, the darkly comic TV show he dreamt up in 2011, takes the latent fear that technology is taking over our lives to queasy and confronting conclusions. A memory chip convinces a man of his wife’s infidelity. An app live-rates people according to their social interactions. A hashtag leads to the death of hundreds of thousands of people. Even the star of another of Brooker’s hit shows, the clueless TV presenter Philomena Cunk, begins from a worst-case scenario — “you’ve hired an idiot”, as he puts it.
This is the way Brooker’s brain works, he tells me on a Zoom call from his home in Ealing, west London. “I can’t look at any situation without immediately seeing the public information film version playing in my head. If kids are bouncing around on a trampoline, I’m thinking: well, one of them’s about to smash his knee through the other one’s nose. So you have to laugh at that, otherwise it’s going to drive you mad.”
In 2020, one of the worst things that could happen did happen: the Covid-19 pandemic, a vast human tragedy that also had Black Mirror-ish elements — a malfunctioning tracing app, park benches covered in police caution tape, people scrubbing their banknotes and “isolating” their groceries. (What is Black Mirror-ish? The show’s creator defines it loosely as “a sort of bleak, dark, slightly tongue-in-cheek but fairly chilling world view”.)
Locked down at home, Brooker and his wife, TV presenter and writer Konnie Huq, watched a lot of television, like the rest of us. He also started to write the sixth season of Black Mirror, which is something of a departure. It shifts from the technological nightmares of earlier seasons into realms of classic sci-fi and gothic horror, and from the present or near-future to the past (three of the five episodes are, more or less, period pieces).
“The show began because I wanted to do something that was unlike other programmes, and had a lot of variety in it, because it stops me getting bored,” Brooker says. “The show was never set up to be, ‘Here’s what’s in the technology pages this week, let’s come up with a story about it.’
“I’d done lots of episodes about people’s consciousnesses being trapped in computers, and a lot of AI episodes. I was thinking, oh God, are people expecting me to do an episode about fucking

NFTs
A unit of information stored as a token on a blockchain, usually an ethereum blockchain. However, it is not fungible — meaning it cannot be interchanged with another token. That makes the token unique and turns its blockchain into a digital form of provenance. It can only have one owner. Some artists and sellers of collectible memorabilia have begun experimenting with selling NFTs. But owning the token only proves that someone has ownership of the “original” work, and does not necessarily include its copyright or its intellectual property rights.

Instead, he turned his sights on the medium with which he’s long had a love-hate relationship: TV. The 52-year-old was a scabrous TV critic at the turn of the millennium, when he was also starting his TV writing career on the satirical news programme The 11 O’Clock Show.
The kernel of the Black Mirror season six episode “Loch Henry”, which riffs on true crime tropes, came from viewing a grisly but beautifully shot documentary set in Scotland. “We ended up googling where it had happened, because we wanted to go on holiday there,” says Brooker. “And I thought: ‘That is a bit weird.’” “Mazey Day”, set in the early 2000s, the high-water mark of celebrity-obsessed culture, was inspired by a binge-watch of Britney Spears documentaries.
The first episode, “Joan is Awful”, is about a woman who turns on her TV to discover that the day she’s just lived has been turned into a show in which she’s played by Salma Hayek. It’s a neat satire of a parched media landscape in which a person’s life can become fodder for a magazine article that’s immediately turned into a prestige drama, a spin-off documentary and a 10-part podcast.
“I was watching The Dropout with Konnie, which is the drama about [Theranos founder] Elizabeth Holmes,” says Brooker. “There was a bit where the Elizabeth Holmes character is goofing around and dancing with her boyfriend. And I thought: this is so cringey, they can’t know she did that behind closed doors. And that it would be so weird if you were one of the people involved in this, watching what had just happened to you being played out by Hollywood stars.”
The show within “Joan is Awful” airs on Streamberry, a Netflix-alike streamer whose executives are passionate about “driving engagement” by playing on viewers’ worst fears and impulses. Black Mirror was originally developed at Channel 4 but has been a Netflix show since 2015. “At that point [Netflix had] done Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, but they didn’t have that many of their own shows. We were one of the early adoptees . . . I did think: well, this is clearly the future, what better place to put this show?”
Brooker doesn’t seem to have offended Netflix with “Joan is Awful” — they’ve allowed him to use a logo that’s “actionably close” to their own for the show. “If it wasn’t on Netflix, we’d be sued.” Anyway, the point is bigger than just one streaming giant. “I get absolute vertigo if I think too much about how many shows there are in existence,” says Brooker. “Things are such a big time investment, it’s like trying to work out where you’re going to move house to.”
When Brooker started writing the new season, he had a sense that technology had “plateaued”. That has since been upended by the arrival of

		 because it’s hoovering up other people’s work and repackaging it.” He also toyed with an idea about an AI stand-up comedian. “I didn’t know quite what the story was, but I had a basic idea that there was an Elon Musk-type figure involved, who decides this AI stand-up is great because it insults everyone. And then, of course, it starts turning on him.”
He abandoned the idea, he says, because he felt it would arrive too late. Black Mirror, of course, is famous for getting there before anyone else (think of “Be Right Back”, the season two episode that involved a ChatGPT-style bot for comforting the bereaved). “When I started writing the show, that was around the time of the Arab spring, when everyone was going: wow, isn’t social media great? And we were still excited to get a new model of iPhone, rather than going, ‘oh, it’s basically got more cameras on the back’. But now there are a billion dystopian shows where people are surrounded by chrome and glass and crying.”
Would he still like to do an episode on a Musk-like character? “I think there’s been a huge amount of examination in Succession or The White Lotus or Billions of how shit the rich are. So I think other people have done possibly a better job of that . . . I find it weird and worrying that Elon Musk wants to be funny, but seems to miss the point of a lot of humour. The phrase ‘punching down’ is possibly overused, but that seems to be the sort of humour that amuses him. And there’s a gleeful, ‘nothing matters’ embrace of misinformation, which is terrifying.”
It’s just one more thing to worry about. As is the new series. “If you tinker with the formula, you risk alienating people who like your show,” he says. “But fuck it. These episodes are standalones. And there are no rules.”
The sixth season of ‘Black Mirror’ is on Netflix from June 15

https://www.ft.com/content/a85f2d38-1889-4108-92af-525ed924b133,Christopher Grimes,Netflix is taking a necessary risk in tackling its 100mn freeloaders,2023-05-26,04:00:49,"When Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings declared in 2016 “we love people sharing” accounts, the company had a commanding lead in the streaming business and four years of blistering growth ahead of it. No one had yet heard of Disney Plus or the streaming wars. 
But after the platform lost subscribers early last year, Hastings called time on this breezy attitude towards password sharing, which has given rise to an estimated 100mn Netflix freeloaders around the world. 
In recent days, the company has launched password crackdowns in the US, UK and more than 100 other countries. In the US, it has told customers that if they want to share their password, they must pay $7.99 a month to add a person outside their home, or $6.99 if they are prepared to have an account with adverts. 
The crackdown plus the new push into advertising reflect the tough realities of the streaming business model that Netflix pioneered. In the boom times, investors were willing to overlook eight- or nine-figure quarterly losses as long as subscription growth was strong. Now, however, new sign-ups have slowed and competition is intense. In the US, the average household has 5.5 streaming subscriptions, notes Jennifer Chan, global strategic director at research group Kantar. 
“Overall household streaming penetration hasn’t changed very much since the end of Covid,” Chan said. “So the focus for streamers now is on retaining their current customer base and becoming the priority subscription so that consumers aren’t cancelling — and if they are, how do you win them back.” 
Investors meanwhile want to see a path to profitability, putting serious pressure on most of the major streaming services to slash costs and come up with new strategies to generate cash. 
Netflix is profitable, but Disney Plus, Paramount Plus and NBCUniversal’s Peacock are still racking up hefty losses. Warner Bros Discovery, which aggressively cut costs after the companies were combined in a $40bn merger last year, recently told investors it expected to turn a profit in its streaming business a full year ahead of schedule and that this part of the business made $50mn in profit in the most recent quarter. 
Like Netflix, Warner has been making big changes to its streaming service. On Tuesday it combined its HBO Max service — home of Succession, White Lotus and Game of Thrones — with Discovery Plus, which specialises in low-cost unscripted programming such as 90-Day Fiancé. The combined service was renamed Max, and the company hopes the broader offering will increase customer numbers and engagement. 
Disney chief executive Bob Iger plans a similar move later this year by merging child-friendly Disney Plus and Hulu, which focuses on general entertainment aimed at adults, into one app. Iger said this would boost sales of Disney’s with-adverts subscription packages, another step towards reaching its goal of turning a profit in streaming next year. In the meantime he must also address investor worries about subscriber growth — the company’s streaming services have lost customers for the past two quarters. 
Netflix may face similar problems of retaining customers as it cuts password sharing options. In early trials, Netflix said some users dumped the service, with as many as 1mn cancellations in Spain alone, according to Kantar. While many return — either adding new accounts or opting for the cheaper ad-supported version — there is still some risk, Chan says. 
“If people are to cancel their subscription, they will be exposed to life without Netflix” and perhaps switch to other services, she said. “I think people will come back, but they may not regain their whole subscriber base.”

The US group, which has said the free use of its platform has hit its ability to invest in new TV and films, plans to start warning customers over account-sharing violations in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with the situation. 
Telecoms groups that use Netflix as part of bundled TV content have held meetings in the past week over the planned warnings, people familiar with the talks said. Companies such as Sky, BT, Virgin Media and TalkTalk offer Netflix as part of bundled deals on broadband and TV content.
But those close to the talks said there was a risk of complaints from some subscribers, many of whom have grown accustomed to sharing their account details with family and friends, activity to which the company had previously turned a blind eye. One person described it as being a “good partner” to groups that offer the service as part of their subscriptions.
Telecoms companies’ call centres are likely to field questions and complaints once the plans are enacted, according to a person familiar with the issue, which has meant that they have needed close co-operation with Netflix.
The company had sought to ensure its partners were kept informed about its plans as they progressed over the past few months, one person close to the talks added.
Once the account-sharing crackdown begins, customers will be encouraged to set a primary location that will mean anyone who lives in their household can use their Netflix account, according to the people. 
If it finds the account is being used outside that primary location, the account holder will be emailed about the extra usage, with “interstitials” related to the matter inserted into the start of programming.
The warnings will roll out across most of its major markets, including the US and UK, in a move to stop non-subscribers from freely using customers’ passwords and instead turn them into paying customers.
Netflix in April estimated that more than 100mn households around the world shared accounts with other users.
The company was forced to delay the planned rollout of its crackdown on account sharing from the first to the second quarter of the year.

After clampdowns in Canada, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal in the first quarter, Netflix said in a letter to shareholders that its new “paid sharing” service — in which customers share their account with people outside their household for a fee — had resulted in a “cancel reaction” that led to lower membership growth.
But Netflix said that after the initial drop-off, subscribers soon started adding “extra member” accounts, boosting revenues and persuading management that it was taking “the right approach”.
In Canada, the paid subscriber base was now higher than before the launch of the paid sharing service, the company said.
The streaming service is seeking to improve profitability in the face of rising competition from rivals such as Disney and Apple. Netflix declined to comment.

https://www.ft.com/content/64279611-9c8e-4ee5-ae52-6e25b76847d1,Moira O’Neill,Can Netflix really teach us ‘how to get rich’?,2023-05-12,09:56:15,"The cost of living crisis and inflation are today’s biting financial challenges, leading many of us to turn to friends, family or financial advisers for guidance. 
But millions are also turning to the streaming services, which are churning out a lot of financial self-help content, not least Netflix, most recently with a programme called How to get Rich, which unexpectedly made it into the Netflix Global Top 10.
So what’s being said here that’s new? The show is hosted by Californian personal finance coach Ramit Sethi, who has a bestselling book and podcast. He delivers a personal finance version of tidying up guru Marie Kondo’s approach to happiness: his basic idea being to “spend extravagantly on the things you love, and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t”. 
Sethi, 40, started his financial journey as “a dude in a dorm room” at Stanford University, after he lost half a college scholarship on the stock market. He recommends budgeting and, for investors, low-cost Vanguard funds. He warns against day trading, telling one young high-earning man on his show that his £100,000 in the red via trading on Robinhood is gambling, not investing. Plus, he’s great on how to have the money conversations that we all need to have, particularly if you’re part of a couple that disagrees on the fundamentals.
It’s common sense stuff, eloquently explained. For example: “We will spend our entire life agonising over $3 questions and completely ignore the $30,000 questions. A cup of coffee every day will make no difference in your life. But, are you paying a 1 per cent fee to a financial adviser, which will actually take 28 per cent of your returns directly out of your pocket in fees?” But it’s hardly rocket science.
The show’s success comes partly from our inner voyeur — viewers want to see how much the colourful case studies earn and spend. From a drag queen in debt to a divorcee with a trust fund, plus a charming couple saving for a dream wedding, we get excruciating details about their bank balances and money troubles. 
But the series title is misleading. This is not about doubling your money overnight or even about growing it faster. And, at a time when energy bills are going through the roof, Sethi’s over-repeated and wearingly enthusiastic catchphrase of “saying YES to a Rich Life”, is somewhat hard to take. Maybe I’m too British.
I think Sethi has won his viewers because he delivers what seems like the opposite of traditional money advice. Instead of focusing on saying “no” in order to save, he encourages people to say “yes” to spending whatever their finances allow.
This focus on enjoying the money you have — “thinking big” in order to “feel rich” — is interesting. His top three takeaways focus on the psychology around meaningful spending, changing patterns ingrained in childhood and making the switch from saving to spending.
I caught up with him to delve deeper. He explains: “Rich could mean travelling two months a year, a beautiful cashmere coat, picking up your kids from school every afternoon. The key here is that your ‘rich life’ is yours, nobody else’s.
“The biggest surprise is that people don’t think about it at all. Most of us wake up, eat breakfast, go to work, answer some emails, come home and watch TV and that’s a pretty good day. But when I ask people ‘What it is for?’ I get back answers like ‘retirement’. In fact, when I ask ‘What would you like to spend more on?’ there’s often no answer.”
Sethi recalls a man in Washington who said if he were to quadruple his spending, it would be on eating out. He initially joked: “I’ll probably have to watch my weight because I’ll be eating out four times a week.” But after some thought, he said: “I would take my family with me to these Michelin star restaurants because they could never afford to go on their own.”
For Sethi, this realisation is “the beautiful part of money”. “At the beginning level of personal finance, it’s always about the ‘what’. What can I get? Can I get that jacket? I have no problem with that. But at the highest level of money, it is always about ‘who’. Who do I get to bring with me? Who can I surprise with generosity?”
He recommends we all create a one-month, a one-year or even a 10-year bucket list — and working out what it costs. “The important thing is that you find a way to use your money to get excited versus simply paying bills.”
Sethi recognises that our childhood dramatically affects our views of money, but argues that those views can be changed.
It’s important not to miss the opportunity to spend, particularly in the prime spending years between the ages of 40 to 60
“When I speak to people who have accumulated a significant amount of money and yet feel anxious about spending it, we’ll often spend time tracing it back to a conversation they remember from when they were six years old with their parents around the dining table, and they will realise that they are haunted by the ghosts of what their parents or even their grandparents said.”
He believes the characteristic of people who are good at saving, but who struggle with spending, is that they simply never took the time to develop the skill. 
And it’s important not to miss the opportunity to spend, particularly in the prime spending years between the ages of 40 to 60. “Before 40 most people don’t have that much money. After 60 there are potential health challenges, whether it be you, a partner or a family member who you want to take care of. So, if you imagine this prime spending between 40 and 60, you start to ask yourself: ‘Wow, I have a window during which there are certain things in life that I can likely only do now.’ ”
Ouch. That hits home. I’m in my 40s so I will start a conversation with my husband around our 10-year spending plan.
Do I feel richer after talking to Sethi? No. Would I let him dissect my financial life and see my bank balance? Probably not.
But I’d watch his next series, if only to learn from the folly of others. And maybe also to feel a little smug that my finances, though not perfect, are in better shape than they could be.

The four-year investment to produce Korean dramas, films and unscripted shows was announced after South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol met Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos in Washington as part of his six-day state visit to the US this week. 
Sarandos said the investment, which is double the amount Netflix has spent in South Korea so far, underlines his confidence in the country’s soft power, after the series Squid Game released in September 2021 became one of the US streaming service’s most-watched programmes.
“Their stories are now at the heart of the global cultural zeitgeist,” Sarandos said, citing Squid Game, The Glory and Physical: 100.
South Korea has emerged as a global cultural powerhouse, with Netflix users spending more time watching shows from South Korea than from any country outside the US. 
Following the footsteps of Netflix, other global streaming services such as Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus are also increasing investment in South Korea. The country’s exports of content including music, films and video games reached a record high of $12.4bn in 2021, according to the latest government data.
South Korean content has captivated global fans with more than 60 per cent of Netflix viewers watching a programme from the country last year, according to the company’s data. 
Yoon welcomed the new investment, saying it “will be a great opportunity for the Korean content industry, creators and Netflix”.
Recommended
Netflix is set to increase its Asia-Pacific content spending by 15 per cent to $1.9bn this year, according to Singapore-based research group Media Partners Asia. The streamer spends $17bn on content globally each year.
South Korea is Netflix’s top spending destination in Asia, with the streaming platform planning to produce at least 34 original programmes in 2023.
Netflix last year released 29 exclusive Korean dramas, six of which reached the top 10 titles in the Asia-Pacific region, according to Media Partners Asia subsidiary AMPD Research. The Glory, a 16-episode drama produced by Studio Dragon dealing with school violence, was one of Netflix’s 10 most popular series in more than 90 countries in March.
Shares of South Korean entertainment companies gained ground on Tuesday, with Showbox and Studio Dragon up 11.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively, while the benchmark Kospi Composite index fell 1.4 per cent.

https://www.ft.com/content/59538a2f-6298-44b7-b007-10cd54b6dc61,Dan Einav,"The Diplomat, Netflix review — an embarrassment to the embassy",2023-04-21,13:00:49,"The Diplomat is — how to put this diplomatically? — not quite all that it could have been. The eight-part Netflix thriller, about a newly appointed US ambassador to the UK, brings with it the promise of arcane international intrigue and glamour befitting a Ferrero Rocher ad. It also boasts the involvement of storied names with (geo) political drama pedigree, from showrunner Debora Cahn (a writer/producer on The West Wing and Homeland) to lead Keri Russell (The Americans) and Rory Kinnear, whose previous outing as a TV prime minister (in Black Mirror) was memorably, er, hammy.
And yet the series spurns the opportunity to provide a considered look at international relations in favour of a generic and improbably-plotted yarn. It follows Kate Wyler (Russell), a starchy career diplomat who must almost single-handedly avert a global catastrophe after a British warship is bombed in the Gulf. Despite having no ambassadorial experience to speak of, Kate is offhandedly chosen by the US president (Michael McKean) to head up the London embassy thanks to her Middle East expertise and the simple fact that there’s a significant vacancy that urgently needs to be filled.
Kate’s arrival leads to strained relationships, both special and spousal. Not only does she distrust the intentions of the bellicose, populist prime minister (Kinnear), but also those of her husband (Rufus Sewell), a recently decommissioned diplomat who holds political ambitions grander than hosting soirées. Within two days in the job, one has threatened to unleash “hellfire” while the other risks getting her fired. 
Though Kate talks about gossamer threads that hold the world in place, the show itself lacks delicacy and nuance. Its problem is that it’s at once too light and too heavy: so exaggerated that it has little to say about actual statecraft (despite vague allusions to current affairs) and so dry and insistently talky that it struggles to entertain.
There’s enough serviceable acting and production value to make this passable viewing, but you expect it won’t be too long before The Diplomat is reassigned from the Netflix homepage to some far-flung spot in its ever-expanding library.

The streaming video company estimated revenues would hit $8.24bn in the second quarter, less than the $8.47bn expected by Wall Street analysts, according to an earnings release on Tuesday. Its shares initially fell more than 10 per cent in after-hours trading before rebounding and recovering those losses.
Netflix said in a letter to shareholders that the “paid sharing” service — which lets customers share their account with people outside their household for a fee — had resulted in a “cancel reaction” after it was launched in some markets including Canada and Spain.
That initially hurt “near-term” growth in its membership numbers, but Netflix said the crackdown ultimately led to higher subscriptions and revenue as the borrowers activated their own accounts. In Canada, the paid subscriber base was now higher than before the launch of the “paid sharing service”, the company said.
Netflix said about 100mn households “share” their accounts globally. According to Morgan Stanley estimates, Netflix could potentially convert 20-30 per cent of those to paying members.
“This account sharing initiative is about creating a larger base of potential members,” Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive, said during a video presentation on Tuesday. “That’s why were focused so much on execution.”
After Netflix shocked investors last April by revealing it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade, it announced two new programmes to increase its revenue: the crackdown on password sharing and the launch of an advertising-supported service, which debuted in November.
It said it was delaying the wider launch of paid sharing to the US and three other markets from the first quarter to the second, which would shift “some of the membership growth and revenue benefit” from the second quarter to the third. This could also cause engagement with Netflix’s service to shrink “modestly” in the short term, it said, although it expected that would recover over time.
Despite the rollout delays, Netflix said it was confident it could hit its full-year targets, adding it was “pleased” with the recent paid-sharing launches.
Recommended
Spencer Neumann, Netflix chief financial officer, said new ad-supported services were still in “start-up mode”.
But the company said it had not seen many customers ditch their high-priced subscriptions in favour of the cheaper ad-supported options as some had feared.
Sarandos warned that a potential Hollywood writers’ strike next month would be “devastating” to the creative community and to viewers, but he added that Netflix has a strong foundation of international content that would help it weather a strike. “We really don’t want [a strike] to happen,” Sarandos said. “We’re at the [negotiating] table”.
Netflix added 1.7mn subscribers around the world in the first quarter, below Wall Street forecasts of 2.3mn. Its revenues rose 3.7 per cent to $8.16bn but net income dropped from $1.6bn to $1.3bn. Earnings of $2.88 a share were ahead of investor expectations.
The company also announced that it would wind down its DVD rental programme in September after 25 years, marking the end of a service that was the core of Netflix’s business model when it was founded.

https://www.ft.com/content/159d14f8-bbd5-47d6-a8f2-bc86d5f5104b,Dan Einav,Transatlantic — new Netflix series paints wartime escapades with unexpected glamour,2023-04-14,08:00:32,"In 1940, thousands of refugees arrived in the port city of Marseille hoping to escape Nazi Europe only to discover that swimming to America would be no less arduous than obtaining the required exit visas and transit papers.
New Netflix series Transatlantic follows the campaign mounted by the volunteer American Emergency Rescue Committee (ERC) to smuggle more than 2,000 Jewish or anti-fascist artists, intellectuals and dissidents out of Vichy-ruled Marseille to neutral Iberia and, from there, the US. It’s a remarkable true story of heroism, humanity, French self-preservation and American isolationism. But it’s dramatised in such a mannered way that unbelievable truths come to seem unreal.
Some of the glamour and frivolity can at least be contextualised. The ERC, led by the journalist Varian Fry (Cory Michael Smith), did in fact operate out of a lavish hotel (later a country château) and were partially bankrolled by the Europhile Chicago socialite Mary Jayne Gold (Gillian Jacobs). While awaiting deliverance, the sheltered visionaries and freethinkers — including Max Ernst, André Breton and Hannah Arendt — continued to create, debate and celebrate life together. At one point here we see “Europe’s finest minds” take part in a drunken conga.
But instead of bringing a dramatic immediacy to the past, Transatlantic (co-created by Anna Winger of Deutschland 83) seems content to steep itself in nostalgia. Over seven episodes the series fluctuates between wartime adventuring — full of close getaways, ingenious schemes, espionage and seduction — and a Midnight in Paris-style reverie populated by great artists painted in broad brushstrokes.
Recommended
The more the show leans towards levity, the more the gravity of the actual circumstances in which these escapes and escapades played out is jarringly reduced. While there are scenes touched by trauma and tragedy, and some weighty ethical and political dilemmas, too often the feelings of peril, displacement and helplessness fail to travel. With its luscious aesthetic, slick pacing and throwback charm, Transatlantic largely delivers as entertainment. But given the subject matter, it should be so much more than that.

For proof see Beef, a bilious black comedy-drama coming to Netflix (though produced by indie studio A24), in which two brittle people finally snap as they try to leave a Los Angeles car park. 
When struggling handyman Danny (Steven Yeun) almost reverses his truck into the SUV behind, he’s met with histrionic honking and a middle finger belonging to tightly wound entrepreneur Amy (Ali Wong). Both are desperately in need of a personal victory and neither is willing to take the high road. Instead they chase each other through red lights and oncoming traffic — a death drive for two individuals with very different but similarly unfulfilled lives. 
From this initial, rage-filled encounter (or “meet-brute”) a bitter enmity emerges. Once Amy and Danny discover the identity of their foe, they take turns exacting revenge. Over 10 episodes, the mutually destructive feud escalates from puerile pranking to attacks on property, careers and personal relationships, causing considerable

		damage along the way.
But if there’s a rubbernecking thrill in watching how low and how far Amy and Danny are willing to go, Beef is more psychologically and emotionally eloquent than the Looney Tunes set-up might suggest. While the show is often very funny, it is most absorbing when it explores why people might be compelled to abdicate all rationality and embrace hate. 
As the series goes on, Amy and Danny become more objectionable but also easier to understand. We see how their vendetta offers them a much-needed sense of purpose and power, and also an escape from the fronts they have to put on every day. “I’m so sick of smiling,” complains Danny at one point. But as he scampers away from his rival’s house having soiled her expensive flooring, the grin on his face is one of pure, unaffected delight.
The same sentiment is echoed by Amy: “I hate pretending that I don’t hate things,” she says. Wong, who came to fame as a stand-up comedian, excels in these quieter moments in which she reveals the conflict within her character that fuels her ire. Often her face seems to be on the verge of shattering under the strain of having to hide her pain and self-loathing, not least from her exhaustingly positive husband (Joseph Lee). And when she does let the facade drop, it’s nothing short of electrifying.
Yeun too is brilliant at inhabiting Danny’s wounded pride, frustrated aspiration and gnawing feeling of emptiness. A strong supporting cast meanwhile help expand the scope of the story to take in family dynamics, Asian-American identity and moneyed LA elites.
But like his characters, series creator Lee Sung Jin ends up taking things to a misjudged extreme with some tonally-dissonant, narratively overcooked final episodes. Even so, there’s enough to savour in Beef to make it a rare dramatic success for Netflix in recent times.

As a child, I loved fantasy best. I read Darren Shan, Joseph Delaney and CS Lewis. I watched Hercules, Aladdin and Mulan. I watched the animes Naruto and Dragon Ball Z. I played games from The Legend of Zelda, Monster Hunter and Dragon Quest series. 
Because each of them included characters, creatures, deities and concepts from the cultures of a range of places, from Japan and China to Greece and England, I unwittingly immersed myself in them.
From CS Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia series, I learnt about fauns. From Aladdin, I learnt about the One Thousand and One Nights. From Monster Hunter and Dragon Quest, I learnt about qilin (or kirin, in Japan), a chimerical giraffe- or deer-like creature. From Naruto, I learnt about shinobi (the ninja), about the kappa, a half-human half-turtle minor god that stalks rivers, often dragging to their depths unsuspecting victims, and about the Japanese Shinto Sun goddess Amaterasu.
It was only as a university student, reading and writing about great ancient and medieval African civilisations, that I realised that elements from the cultures of these places had been conspicuously missing from the stories I had so enjoyed in my youth. It wasn’t the case, because of this, that I hadn’t connected with those stories; I had. But after my exposure to just a little of the true historical depth and cultural richness of diverse African societies, what did cross my mind is that they had in pop culture been underexplored and underdisplayed.
This may be finally changing. In the past five or so years, we’ve seen the release of a spate of pop culture stories that explore African cultures, from novels (be it Marlon James’s Dark Star trilogy or Tomi Adeyemi’s Children of Blood and Bone), to films (Black Panther and The Woman King), and TV series (African Queens: Njinga).
Black Panther’s release in 2018 was a watershed moment. It was both critically and commercially successful, grossing $1.3bn worldwide. To media executives, creatives and the general public, this proved definitively that there is an audience — an exceptionally large one — for African stories. (Wakanda, the fictional African kingdom of the movie, was of course the invention of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby; but in making the adaptation, director Ryan Coogler and lead actor Chadwick Boseman travelled around the continent and immersed themselves in aspects of the cultures that constituted their heritage.)
Black Panther paved the way for more of these stories to be told. African Queens: Njinga, a docudrama series to which I contributed, was one of them. It is a passion project of American actress Jada Pinkett Smith. She’d had a conversation with her daughter Willow, who’d asked her who the queens of Africa were and why we don’t know about them. 
The series looks at the life of Njinga Mbande, a 17th-century queen of Ndongo, in modern-day Angola, best known for resisting the aggressive attempts of the Portuguese to colonise her kingdom. For 60 years, she fought against them, exercising noteworthy skills in politics, diplomacy and warfare. In Angola and other neighbouring nations, she is seen by many as a hero. In Luanda, Angola’s capital city, a statue was raised to her in 1975 when the nation proclaimed its independence; it still stands. The series’ dramatic sequences were filmed in South Africa, and the expert contributions came from the US, UK and Angola. African Queens: Njinga was a global production, meant to be consumed by a global audience.
The fact that we’re seeing such stories being told and shared on global platforms only recently is not because storytellers — African or otherwise — have only recently begun to tell stories featuring African histories and myths. In the wake of decolonisation, many African storytellers — from journalists and historians to novelists and filmmakers — interrogated what it meant to be African, and the place of traditional African values in societies that had been so heavily influenced by European culture. 
However, as the influence of India, China and many African countries surges, more of these countries’ stories are being widely told and adapted. On Netflix and other streaming platforms, you have access to Korean dramas and Bollywood films as much as American and European shows. Japanese anime, which was a fringe aspect of nerd culture when I used to watch it as a child, has become mainstream. South Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite swept the 2020 Oscars, and Squid Game, created by his fellow countrymen Hwang Dong-hyuk, was almost unfathomably popular. Black Panther, The Woman King and African Queens: Njinga are just a part, albeit an important one, of this wider shift.
Recommended
Considering, however, the size, diversity, depth of history and storytelling talent that characterises Africa, there’s a wealth of stories that are yet to be told. I think of Sundiata Keita, the 13th-century founder of the Mali empire, arguably Africa’s most famous medieval empire. Or Mansa Musa, his great-nephew, who in 1324 made a splendid pilgrimage to Mecca; when he and his train stopped off in Egypt, they spent so much gold in Cairo that they flooded the market with it, devaluing it for more than a decade afterwards. Or Amanirenas, the one-eyed warrior queen who battled against the forces of the Roman emperor Augustus.
When the story-lovers of future generations watch films or TV series or play games that feature African cultures, they’ll come to learn about and appreciate them in a way that no non-African really has before. They might even be inspired to create their own Africa-centric stories. And, in this way, African stories, histories and cultures will take their place on the global stage among those of other cultures from which they have been shut out for far too long.

This is the home of Pornhub, the 12th most visited website in the world and a brand now so pervasive that one can legitimately claim to know about it via cultural osmosis or a billboard in Times Square.
Netflix documentary Money Shot: The Pornhub Story outlines the savvy and cynical strategies underpinning the company’s success. More significantly, it goes on to examine the accusations that Pornhub has at best overlooked, at worst actively profited from, sexual abuse, exploitation and trafficking.
In 2020, a New York Times investigation highlighted how content featuring minors, unconsenting adults and violent assault was being hosted on the site. Major public backlash, lawsuits and the withdrawal of key financial partners soon followed. Pornhub and parent company MindGeek have repeatedly rejected allegations of criminality, but have since removed some 10mn unverified videos.
Risqué title aside, Money Shot is largely serious-minded in its approach and can be seen as a counterpart to the FT’s own Hot Money podcast. Over 90 minutes a number of journalists, child protection experts and whistleblowers provide disturbing accounts of Pornhub’s grave shortcomings — from lax content moderation to their inadequate response to victims of unsanctioned uploads. One particularly enraging claim suggests that the site continued to generate revenue from flagged and even deleted videos.
Director Suzanne Hillinger is as interested in debate as she is in reportage. Throughout, the film considers whether urgent criticisms of insufficient regulation are perhaps leading to wider campaigns against pornography, and invites leading adult performers to share their perspectives. We hear how Pornhub has given them the agency to earn independently of studios and why they’re frustrated that the porn industry is being singled out in an internet-wide issue.
From a divisive, combustible subject, Hillinger manages to rise to the challenge of retaining journalistic distance and steering clear of both moralising prudishness and prurience. But while the film’s focus is mainly on the business of porn, a few explicit shots do mean that this is definitely NSFW viewing.

With no plans from original backers the BBC to grow another season, Idris Elba’s grizzled, determined detective has been repotted in a standalone film. But the formula — DCI John Luther hunts down yet another sadistic murderer, in this case a psychopath played by Andy Serkis — is limp and underwatered, like the weird haystack of fake hair they’ve pinned on to Serkis’s head to make him look sinister.
New hosts Netflix have poured in a fair wodge of money, with locations not just in London, Luther’s usual stamping ground, but also in Iceland (standing in for Norway). There are also beefier, grittier stunt sequences. Yet it all feels like a last flowering before the next step in the cycle, the point where old Luther needs to change career or move aside so that younger, cooler characters can come aboard and spice things up.
For now, writer and series creator Neil Cross deploys all the crime-show conversational clichés, from Luther being reprimanded by superior officers for not doing things by the book to having him earnestly promise a distraught mother (not just once but twice) that he’ll find her missing child, and so on. There’s even that old favourite, an interlude in which our hero is sent to jail and must escape to put things right. Yeah, saw that in Paddington 2, thanks.

To be fair, it must be hard to get the blend of familiarity and innovation right. So, as with earlier seasons, the film delivers plenty of nauseating violence, albeit described more than shown. Like a dumbed-down version of Michael Haneke’s Funny Games, viewers are made to feel somewhat complicit in the torture Serkis’s character inflicts on his victims because — just like the spectators who pay to see the killer’s

Earlier seasons dabbled in the same territory, with cannibalistic killers and women murdered in especially gruesome ways. Cross also recycles from season one the bent-copper device, planting a colleague working within the force who is secretly in thrall to the bad guy. The only key element missing this time is Ruth Wilson’s silky psychopath-cum-love-interest Alice Morgan who spent so much time in the series kittenishly needling and flirting with Luther by turns.

https://www.ft.com/content/27a7c4cc-2344-4884-bbba-f6f268eac97f,Joy Lo Dico,Here’s my Netflix password — but you’ll have to pay for it,2023-02-16,11:15:58,"By the end of the 1980s, six in 10 households in the US had cable television and almost every household in the UK had the BBC burbling away in the corner of the living room. But, I recall, visiting an aunt in rural France as a child was a step into the past. Her neighbour had a television and phone line; she didn’t. Cousins, friends and a little me all piled into the neighbour’s garden. The TV was placed in front of the window for us to watch an international football tournament. I forget which. I just remember the people watching.
It is now taken for granted that most of us have access to a screen in the palm of our hand. We are not tethered to a location through cables and aerials but by data packages and subscriptions to streaming services. Even so, we are still piling into communal screens through sharing passwords. Many a subscription service could map an intricate web of personal connections through various IP addresses logging into one account.
Netflix is not happy. After the long Covid binge, new subscriptions are slowing down, adding only 9mn in 2022, to bring them to a total of 231mn last year. The bean counters say it is time for password sharing to stop. This is already against Netflix’s terms but they’d simply never taken action before.
New rules have been instituted in some countries in Latin America. This month, without notice, Canadians were told they had to nominate a primary household, cutting off access to outsiders unless additional fees were paid. Portugal, Spain and New Zealand account holders faced the same. By the end of March new rules, under which sharing will only be possible for an additional payment, will come into force in the UK and the US will follow.
How many passwords do you share with your friends and family? Share your stories and views in the comments below the piece
The accountants at Netflix justify the move by pointing out that 100mn households are using someone else’s password without a subscription. The desire to share is understandable: there has always been something mildly depressing about watching TV in isolation, rather like pouring yourself a glass of wine at home while the pub down the road sits empty.
Password sharing meant you could watch the same show with friends and keep tabs on what everyone was getting excited by. It meant that the atomisation of personal screens wasn’t as stark. Living rooms and bedrooms in different homes were connected through a shared resource.
You knew what your children were watching through viewing their profile on your premium subscription. And your best friend who’d once asked you for the password. And your ex, who’d once asked your kid for your login and never logged out. The shared experience created a patter of conversation, akin to the British TV show Gogglebox in which TV viewers are filmed in their living rooms watching television.
Shared Netflix passwords have become valued as a token of friendship and as a weapon of revenge
Logins have become valued as a token of friendship and as a weapon of revenge. One of my favourite stories, posted on Twitter, was by a woman whose boyfriend had ditched her but kept hold of her Netflix password. He was mad keen on a series it was airing. The final episode of his favourite show was dropping at midnight and he’d organised a viewing party. She waited until one minute to midnight and then changed the password.
People used to write to newspapers threatening to cancel their subscriptions when an article appeared that they didn’t like. The Netflix announcement has caused a similar outpouring of outrage, particularly among Canadians who don’t see their US neighbours being given the same punishment. But it is more that they won’t be able to watch something they like at a price that they like.
Last year, New York-based Horowitz Research found that the average streamer used 7.1 services per year but only paid for 4.3 of them. Baked into that maths is the evidence that what goes around comes around. You might pay for Disney+ but your mate pays for Amazon Prime and you can swap. (Neither of those services has suggested tightening rules on password sharing yet.) 
A further study by the same company found that seven out of 10 Netflix password sharers would be prepared to buy their own subscription. But in reality, how many streaming services can you justify? US subscribers were paying an average of $54 a month in 2022, according to JD Power. It is a gamble on the power of FOMO.
Recommended
Bob Iger, on his second stint as head of Disney (which, across all its networks, has around the same number of subscribers as Netflix), recently put this hunt for individual subscriptions in the past tense: “We were . . . in a global arms race for subscribers.” The new focus for streaming services is profitability from those who already tune in. 
As can be seen from the Netflix fallout, part of that added value lies in the ability to share. Connected living rooms make connected lives. There’s no point making a great television show if no one’s talking about it.

Possibly sensing that the premise risks appearing more tasteless with every passing year, the new instalment moves away from these darker aspects and leans more heavily towards low-hanging social satire. There’s even a touch of whodunnit cosiness this time round. 
The story picks up a few months after the third season finale, in which Joe (Penn Badgley) killed his equally homicidal wife, faked his own death and went off to pursue his latest crush, Marienne, in Paris. But when we catch up with Joe it’s in London where he’s now happily hiding out as Professor Jonathan Moore. Not only is he teaching literature — and so indulging his intellectual pretensions — but in the most far-fetched scenario that this consistently ludicrous show has served up yet, he’s somehow renting a mansion flat in Kensington on an academic’s salary. 
Living nearby is his “royal-adjacent” colleague Malcolm (Stephen Hagan), who, in an ostensible act of neighbourly goodwill, invites Joe along to a party at an exclusive members club. Among the pampered socialites on display here are characters so cartoonish that they make the widely ridiculed VIPs in Squid Game look Shakespearean. They sneer at “peasants” and “scum” and casually talk about killing the homeless. 
Nuance is not the only thing under violent attack as, before long, some of the elites meet their ends in grisly fashion. Joe suddenly finds himself in an unusual position of vulnerability, tormented by a mysterious texter who seems to know his real identity. Increasingly contrived developments follow, which are at least partially mitigated by Joe’s wry narration. But even as brain-bypassing entertainment this series feels like it has run its course. I don’t think it’s me. It’s You.

Pamela, A Love Story is a new, surprisingly touching Netflix documentary that follows the former Baywatch star as she tries to find personal acceptance. Directed by the Emmy-nominated Ryan White (The Case Against 8), it gives Anderson a chance to retake ownership of a life that has seemed to belong less to her than the public. In 1995 a sex tape she made with her then-husband Tommy Lee was stolen and circulated online, to her horror; last year, the scandal was dramatised by Hulu, without Anderson’s consent, in Pam & Tommy, leaving her feeling exploited anew.
That Pamela, a Love Story opens with Anderson at home on Vancouver Island, rifling through a box of video tapes, feels significant: this is her story to share and to process on her own terms. It is one affected by trauma. We hear how she was molested as a child, raped as a pre-teen and physically assaulted by various partners. Modelling for Playboy freed her from the shame that she felt was invisibly tattooed on her body. Yet she is eager to stress that she is “not a victim”.
A sense of self-possession and awareness (as evidenced in these interviews and in narrated diary extracts) is matched by a willingness to make fun of herself — or how she’s perceived by others. “My boobs had a career and I was just tagging along,” she jokes. At other points, light-hearted remarks about ageing or lacking purpose seem flecked with melancholy.
Pamela trades on its homespun, intimate approach. There are no talking heads besides her parents and sons, no gushing testimonials from other famous faces. No make-up either. Instead there are lengthy montages of journalists and chat show hosts aiming cheap, sexist comments at Anderson over the years. While the film may not win any awards, it might elicit some long-overdue apologies.

But, by his own admission, the 62-year-old is no inventor. 
As a computer science student at Stanford University in the 1980s he dabbled in reimagining hardware, with ambitious plans for a “foot mouse” that would avoid hands straying from the keyboard. He generously summed up that project as “a disaster”. 
Netflix’s early experimentation was not much better. The 25-year-old company first tested movie downloads in 2000 when it explored alternatives to mailing out rental DVDs in red envelopes. But broadband was so slow that it took more than half a day for the film to download — and incurred internet fees higher than the movie cost to rent. 
While admiring “one in a billion” inventors such as Elon Musk, Hastings saw himself playing a different role. He told the Financial Times in 2020: “For the rest of us it is really about trying to build a system.”
He did so with a disruptive force that not only sealed the fate of his rental rival Blockbuster, but ultimately reset the Hollywood model for making and selling video entertainment. 
John Malone, the billionaire who mastered the shift to cable, joked that Netflix shareholders should build a statue to the founder; Hastings floated Netflix as a one dollar stock in 2002 and built it into a $150bn business trading at about $336 a share. Hastings himself owns a stake worth more than $1.6bn today.
“He really broke the mould with his success,” Malone said in November. “He was there early . . . A lot of people are regarding [Netflix] now as a foundational programming service. I just attribute it to his excellent execution.”
Under the plan announced this week, Hastings will continue as an executive chair but hand day-to-day operations to two co-CEOs — Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters — who have worked alongside him for about 25 years and 15 years respectively. They take the reins of a company that has swapped the role of disrupter for that of dominant incumbent: Netflix is now the only profitable big streaming service in the world, with a subscriber base of 231mn and annual content budget of roughly $17bn. 
The challenge for Sarandos and Peters is whether the Netflix system can keep pace with breakneck change still ripping through the entertainment business — and actually deliver returns that come anywhere close to those of the traditional television model in its heyday. 
One rival media executive compared Hastings’ influence on the industry to “the pied piper” — luring legacy media companies towards their demise with an expensive bet on subscription streaming that has left them nursing billions in losses. “None of us know whether this business will pay off,” he said. 
Hastings’ chosen successors, Peters, a polyglot with a background in tech, and Sarandos, who has built the entertainment side, are confident that cable-style margins of 40 per cent plus are ultimately possible as streaming matures. Sarandos on Thursday described Netflix’s business as still in its “infancy”; it accounts for just 8 per cent of television viewing in America. 
But investor faith in Netflix is not what it was. Shares in the streaming group were hammered last year after subscription growth stalled and the stock remains 55 per cent off its 2021 peak. 
The succession plan effectively keeps in place the top trio running the business, with reallocated roles. Both Sarandos and Peters not only saw Hastings borrow ideas to shape the Netflix business, but often saw the projects through themselves. 
Peters was managing the digital division when Netflix eventually did break into streaming in 2010, a full five years after the emergence of YouTube Driven by Sarandos, who joined Netflix in 2000 and has been co-CEO since 2020, the company then deliberately mimicked HBO in moving from distribution into making its own shows. Sarandos’s big bet was placed without explicit approval from Hastings: spending $100mn on House of Cards, one of Netflix’s first breakout hits.
But it remains to be seen what role Hastings, whose singular style has shaped the Netflix corporate culture, will continue to play at the company. He prides himself on clarity and radical honesty, which at times has unnerved his partners. 
The Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph recounts in his memoirs how Hastings edged him out as chief executive in 1999 by calling a meeting, straddling a chair, then presenting a deck of slides on his shortcomings. “He pursed his lips, looking down at the screen like it was a set of cue cards . . . ‘I’m worried about us’,” Randolph described Hastings as saying. “‘Actually, I’m worried about you. About your judgment’.” 
Hastings’ proposed solution was making Randolph co-CEO. It is exactly the same kind of unorthodox leadership arrangement Hastings shared with Sarandos, and that Sarandos will now share with Peters. 
Given their long history working together, some analysts have put little significance on the leadership transition; Tim Nollen of Macquarie argued it was not a “meaningful” change given Hastings was “still on top” as executive chair.
But within Netflix the change in titles is marking a shift in responsibilities that has been evident for some time. Hastings, who spreads mild terror among staff with his habit of turning office meetings into urban strolls, is already less hands-on than in the past, delegating most Hollywood decisions to Sarandos, according to people familiar with the matter. 
This may allow his successors to take more risks in diversifying the business. Hastings used to tell colleagues “strategy is pain” as he explained why it was important for Netflix to show discipline and resist straying from its core model of subscription video. 
Recommended
He was one of the last to hold out against creating an ad-supported tier of membership, which Netflix rolled out last year. Some insiders envisage his successors potentially now having more liberty to experiment with gaming, or other distribution models for the company’s shows, whether in cinemas or by licensing its content outside its platform. “There won’t be a radical shift but they might test the boundaries more,” said one Netflix veteran. 
Hastings walks towards the stage exit at a pivotal point for the media industry wrestling with how to make streaming profitable. “Rather than being the new sliced bread, investors and executives have accepted that streaming is, in fact, not a good business — at least compared to what came before,” wrote analysts at SVB MoffettNathanson.

		expected this year. Hastings, who has long had an aversion to companies hoarding cash, has pledged to return anything above minimum levels — roughly two months of revenue — to shareholders. 
Meanwhile friends say Hastings’ personal focus will now also be on giving away his own fortune through philanthropy. “That’s the mission,” said one colleague. “He wants to die poor.”

Hastings, who launched Netflix in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail service, wrote in a blog post that he had been increasingly delegating management in recent years. Now is “the right time to complete my succession”, he added.
“Our board has been discussing succession planning for many years (even founders need to evolve!),” Hastings, 62, wrote. “I’m so proud of our first 25 years, and so excited about our next quarter of a century.”
Chief operating officer Greg Peters has been promoted as co-chief executive with Ted Sarandos, who was in charge of programming during Netflix’s massive investment period and promoted in 2020 to co-chief executive alongside Hastings. 
Netflix shares jumped more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading.
The change comes as Netflix has lost more than a third of its market value in the past year, after revealing its decade-long growth spurt had come to an end. Sarandos and Peters will be charged with regaining momentum and leading Netflix through a more austere era for the entertainment industry. 
Hastings will stay on as executive chair, following the past examples of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. The billionaire founder said he plans to “spend more time on philanthropy” but “remain very focused on Netflix stock doing well”.
The change atop Netflix came as the company reported it added 7.7mn subscribers in the fourth quarter, well above expectations, thanks to popular programming such as the Addams Family spin-off Wednesday and the Harry & Meghan documentary series. Netflix had forecast it would add 4.5mn subscribers in the quarter.

		jitters, Netflix’s huge beat on subscriber numbers has injected some much-needed optimism into the mix.”
Netflix stunned investors last April when it revealed it had lost subscribers, triggering a punishing stock market revaluation of the entire US media industry. After the “Netflix Correction”, Wall Street has become more sceptical of the streaming video market, increasingly focusing on profitability and forcing big entertainment groups to be more cost-conscious. 
Netflix ended 2022 with 231mn paid subscribers, adding 8mn for the year, its worst annual growth in a decade. In a letter to investors, the company said “2022 was a tough year, with a bumpy start but a brighter finish”.

Revenue in the quarter climbed to $7.9bn, up 2 per cent from a year ago. Net income dropped to $55mn in the quarter, down from $607mn in the same period a year ago, a sharp decline that the company attributed in part to the strong US dollar. Operating income declined to $550mn from $632mn. 
The company spent $4bn on content in the quarter, down from $5.7bn at the same time last year.
Shares in Netflix have recovered somewhat from last year’s lows, gaining 9 per cent this year. But its market valuation of $141bn is still about half its peak reached during the coronavirus pandemic. 
As growth in subscribers slows, Netflix has taken two significant steps to shore up its business: introducing a cheaper version of its streaming service with advertisements, and trying to limit password sharing, a practice it had largely ignored when growth was red hot. 
Recommended
Netflix moved quickly to create an advertising tier in partnership with Microsoft, launching the platform in November for $7 a month. The company on Thursday said it was “pleased with the early results”. 
With these two potential new sources of revenue, Netflix has stopped providing guidance to investors on its number of new subscribers — a symbolic shift for a company whose stock price soared for years based on subscriber growth. 
The promotion of Peters, who played a big role in Netflix’s ad tier launch, “is an indication of how much the ad business means to Netflix”, said Paul Verna, analyst at Insider Intelligence. 
“In the same way that Sarandos’ earlier elevation . . . was a sign of Netflix’s maturation from a tech company to a film and TV studio, the current shift puts advertising in the centre of the picture, alongside content.”

Good morning. Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix in 1997, is stepping down as chief executive, he announced last night after the streaming company released its latest quarterly results.
After helping to launch Netflix as a DVD-by-mail service Hastings transformed it into one of the most powerful studios in Hollywood. In a blog post last night he said it was time to “complete my succession”.
Chief operating officer Greg Peters has been promoted to co-chief executive alongside Ted Sarandos, who was in charge of programming during Netflix’s massive investment period and promoted in 2020 to co-chief executive alongside Hastings. 
The change at the top of Netflix’s follows one of its most difficult years. It ended 2022 with 231mn paid subscribers, up 8mn for the year which was the slowest annual growth in a decade.
Netflix stunned investors in April by revealing its decades-long growth spurt had come to an end, forcing it to take steps to shore up its business. It introduced a cheaper ad-supported streaming service, in partnership with Microsoft, and announced a crackdown on password sharing.
Last night Netflix said it was “pleased with the early results” of its new service as it announced fourth-quarter net income dropped to $55mn from $607mn in the same period the year before.
But investors welcomed news that 7.7mn new subscribers had joined to the platform in the final three months of last year, sending shares 6 per cent higher in after-hours trading.

The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House is a charming new Japanese-language series created for Netflix by Palme d’Or-winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters). Based on a popular manga, The Makanai captures the quiet, quaint and codified existence of the trainee geisha (or maiko) living in a small boarding school. Unexpectedly, it is set in the present day.
Then again, time seems to be almost suspended here — both in the modernity-shunning customs followed at Saku House and the unhurried approach of the series itself. This is the kind of drama that luxuriates in detail and takes its time to draw out moments of beauty, feeling and wisdom from daily life.
At the centre of the story are two 16-year-old girls who hope to become the next heirs of an ancient but long-fading tradition — an art now largely reduced to performing for sozzled salarymen. While Sumire (Yuuki Luna) demonstrates all the required poise and refinement, her friend Kiyo (Nana Mori) proves ungainly and distracted by whatever’s happening in the kitchen. Though disappointed to be expelled from the training programme, the latter quickly finds herself in her element when given the chance to take over as the house cook (or makanai).
The specific terms and various maiko practices are sparingly explained in a show that pleasingly makes little direct attempt to spoon-feed western audiences or fetishise geisha culture. More generally, it seems averse to high narrative stakes, interpersonal friction and cynicism. While not oblivious to the strains of this most unusual lifestyle — in which girls are literally prohibited from letting their hair down — The Makanai often simply lets minor tensions dissipate in lingering shots of Kiyo’s culinary concoctions.
Some viewers might find themselves craving more of a plot to bite into. But this tale of friendship, small pleasures and gentle longing is nothing less than a warming, spirit-nourishing delicacy.

But this time her ferocious forehand finds the net. The game, set and match are over. A collective sigh goes up from the vast crowd, followed by a reluctant but resounding cheer. Tears will follow and thousands of articles will be written. The woman is Serena Williams, the match at the 2022 US Open her last as a professional tennis player. Even those with zero interest in the sport know her name and recognise her greatness.
But who was the other woman on the court that day? Only devout tennis nerds will know the answer and few besides them will recognise the name Ajla Tomljanović, even if the Australian is a three-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist and hardly a newcomer.
This is the problem facing tennis today: a handful of household names who have hogged the limelight for two decades are slowly bowing out, to be replaced by newer ones unfamiliar to most of us. Last year we kissed goodbye not only to one Williams (older sister Venus forges on at the age of 42) but also to Roger Federer, perhaps the most beloved player of all. Meanwhile, Rafael Nadal is now asked so often about calling it quits that he quipped last week: “Every time I come to a press conference it seems that I have to retire.” Novak Djokovic may soon be the last active representative of this fab four, who between them have won a preposterous 86 Grand Slam tournaments and counting.
To put it simply: how on earth do you follow that?
The custodians of tennis’s future are hoping that at least part of the answer lies in the new Netflix series Break Point. Released today, on the eve of the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, the Australian Open, which begins on Monday, it follows a clutch of male and female competitors over the course of last year, its aim to excite interest in some of those who are not all-time greats. Not yet, anyway.
Tomljanović is among those featured, paired with her then boyfriend, Italy’s Matteo Berrettini, who reached the Wimbledon final in 2021. Others include fast-rising American Taylor Fritz, gifted young Canadian Félix Auger-Aliassime, hard-hitting Spaniard Paula Badosa and Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur, the first Arab player to reach a Grand Slam final. What it captures, above all, is the relentless grind of professional tennis, a sport that demands players play as many as six matches a week and rewards them with an improbably short off-season. The effects on body and mind can be punishing.
Break Point is the work of Box to Box Films, the same stable that produced Formula 1: Drive to Survive, a roaring success that has helped win a new audience for F1 racing by focusing on the sport’s personalities and inner tensions rather than its technical minutiae. Now four seasons deep, the show is credited with having boosted F1 TV viewership nearly 50 per cent worldwide since it began. In the US, where F1 was previously a niche sport, rights holder ESPN has gone from paying $5mn annually to between $75mn and $90mn.
Tennis would dearly love a similar boost. In the US, its TV viewing figures slumped in a period when American players won fewer big titles. It is more than 20 years since the heydays of Sampras and Agassi, let alone Connors and McEnroe. An American man has not won a Grand Slam since Andy Roddick in 2003. Last year saw some signs of recovery: Serena Williams’s career-ending defeat was the most-watched US Open match in seven years.
“Americans tend to stand behind their teams, their athletes,” says Micky Lawler, president of the Women’s Tennis Association. “So when you have American athletes leading the charge, the sport does very well. With Serena retiring, she leaves a big void.”
No one knows whether lightning will strike a second time with Break Point but there is at least now a rod to catch it if it does. “F1 was this new, shiny, sexy proposition that a lot of people got behind because of Drive to Survive,” says Lawler. “So I think Break Point will help us a lot in the US.”
Tennis snobs are already sneering at the prospect — they of course followed all the events covered in the series last year — but the cognoscenti are not the target audience. The aim is to appeal to the casual fan and potential convert. Executive producer James Gay-Rees, whose CV also includes Asif Kapadia’s acclaimed sports documentaries Senna and Diego Maradona, explains the rationale.
“Most people will never get close to driving an F1 car — it’s fucking terrifying — but most of us have played tennis on some level at some point,” he says. “Sometimes you have just a little purple patch for 10 minutes when it all clicks. And you know how frustrating it can be as well.” By focusing on some of the top players in the game, the idea was “to make a series which shows you exactly how hard it is to do what they do”.
The series does this with an approach that owes as much to reality TV as documentary. In each episode, a narrative is constructed around one or two players at a particular tournament. We see them train, train some more and train harder, but there are also cosy interludes at home with families and partners.
The mood often veers closer to the desolate chill of Ingmar Bergman than the fist-pumping triumphalism of Rocky. We see the hope in players’ eyes as they ready themselves for a match. Then we watch it fade on court — our new knowledge of their backgrounds adding pathos — before they disconsolately pack up their belongings and head to the next event. 
“We prepared them for that,” says series showrunner Kari Lia. “We said, ‘We are going to be with you when you win, and we’re going to be with you when you lose. And you are going to lose more than you win.’”
She describes one scene capturing Tomljanović after a particularly gruesome defeat. “She’s there crying in the hallway. It’s really raw. And it was important for us to include in the film, because losing is a part of playing tennis. As Taylor [Fritz] says in episode three, at every tournament you have 128 players and there are 127 losers by the end of it.”
Tennis last year was not short of dramatic episodes: the will-they-won’t-they nail-biter of unvaccinated Djokovic’s deportation from Australia, then the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian players from Wimbledon. And later those emotional goodbyes, Federer and Nadal clasping hands as they sobbed through the former’s farewell ceremony at September’s Laver Cup.
Yet in Break Point the very biggest names feature only peripherally. Federer was injured for most of the 2022 season and Williams and Nadal clearly had no need for the extra publicity. Nor did Djokovic, who has anyway for some time been followed by his own cameras for a long-promised but delayed documentary.
Also absent is the new world number one, 19-year-old Spanish phenomenon Carlos Alcaraz, who claimed his first Grand Slam title at last year’s US Open. (On the women’s side, Poland’s currently indomitable Iga Świątek, already a three-time Grand Slam champ at 21, is due to appear later in the series.) That some of the top players do not appear in Break Point reflects the fragmented nature of the sport. The bigger the asset, the more closely guarded they will be by their management teams.
This may change over time. Current F1 world champion Max Verstappen refused to take part in the past three seasons of Drive to Survive because of what he called “faking rivalries” but will feature in the upcoming fifth season. The Dutchman was not the only one to voice concerns. F1 fans decried a less desirable “Drive to Survive effect” that they say influenced race directors to steer Grands Prix towards more sensational outcomes. Tennis observers will be scrutinising tournaments and players for any similar grandstanding. (A Box to Box series entitled Full Swing, following professional golfers, has also just been announced for February.)
What we get for now in Break Point is a series of mini-dramas, such as one involving Auger-Aliassime at last year’s French Open. In the fourth round he faced Rafael Nadal, 14-time winner of the tournament, on the red clay of Paris — arguably the toughest challenge in all of tennis. But what adds further intrigue on screen is the presence of Auger-Aliassime’s coach, who happens to be Toni Nadal, Rafa’s uncle and former coach.
The camera captures some deliciously awkward moments. Rafa coming off court after his previous match to see Toni, quickly switching to Mallorquí and asking: “Are you even allowed to be on this side?” Later we see the no-nonsense Toni looking uncharacteristically bashful when Auger-Aliassime broaches the subject of his next opponent. But asked by press whom he will be supporting, Toni is his usual straightforward self: he wants Rafa to win. “I’d be surprised if that relationship survives,” says one commentator.
Remarkably, it did, and Auger-Aliassime now shrugs off the incident. When we speak via video call, I ask whether, given all the pressures that he already faces as a tennis player, he thought twice before agreeing to let the cameras in.
“I was thinking about it, for sure. I was like, I’m still young, is it too much for me? Am I going to be able to just focus on my tennis? Is it going to take me out of my habits? But I always kept in mind the bigger picture, which is, OK, it’s annoying that they’re filming. But this is actually something that can be good for tennis, for the future, for new fans.”
As well as such moments of tennis-related drama, however, more troubling events have bedevilled the men’s game in recent years. In 2020, Olga Sharypova, ex-girlfriend of former world number two Alexander Zverev, made allegations of domestic violence against the German star. He has repeatedly denied the claims. A promised investigation by the men’s players’ governing the body, the ATP, is yet to materialise, but Zverev is not featured in Break Point. When the Netflix series was mentioned during a press conference last January, he appeared surprised, suggesting that he had not been invited to participate.
But another player who has made the cut is Nick Kyrgios. Known as the flashy Australian bad boy of tennis, Kyrgios, now 27, has a large fan following and an equally large army of detractors. Some are justifiably outraged by his verbal abuse of officials and crowds; others, on Twitter, are nakedly racist. The first episode of Break Point focuses almost entirely on him, his early defeat in the singles competition at the Australian Open and eventual triumph in the doubles with childhood friend Thanasi Kokkinakis. What goes unmentioned is that since then Kyrgios has been accused of assault by an ex-girlfriend, Chiara Passari. His lawyers have said that he is “committed to addressing any and all allegations once clear” and he is due in court next month.
Gay-Rees assures me that this is addressed in a later episode in the series (only the first five of 10 have been made available so far), that players “didn’t have any editorial control” and that “there were no no-go areas”. For the moment, however, Kyrgios seems to be enjoying the experience. Never one to shrink from playing the troll, he last week tweeted: “Haha so after all this, all the media, journalism saying how bad I am for the sport, disrespecting the game & just a pure villain, I am going to be the number 1 episode on Netflix . . . to grow our fan base, basically trying to put tennis on the map again.”
One aspect of the game that has been gaining more attention in recent years is the mental health of players. Kyrgios has been candid in the past about having experienced self-harm and suicidal thoughts. In Break Point, the subject of mental health arises most starkly in an episode featuring Paula Badosa, 25, who rose to world number two last April and has also spoken openly about suffering periods of anxiety and depression. The series catches up with her at the 2022 Madrid Open where she suffers an early defeat. Usually this is where tennis coverage ends — to the winner belong the spoils and the cameras.
Not here: instead we see a stricken Badosa and her coaching team attempting to pick up the pieces. She tells her team that she can quickly slip from feeling fine on court to “Get me out of here. I want to die.” Given the ruthlessly competitive nature of the sport, did she have doubts about showing such vulnerability to her rivals?
“Of course you have those thoughts,” she tells me via video call from Brisbane. “I don’t know if this is going to be OK, to show that part of myself. But, on the other hand, I just want to be honest and to normalise a little bit all these situations to help other athletes.”
Those unfamiliar with the game might expect such troubles to affect only the players unable to find success at the highest level. Not so. Naomi Osaka won four Grand Slam titles in four years before opening up about having “suffered long bouts of depression” over that same period. However, her attempt to pull out of mandatory media assignments at the 2021 French Open was met with a furious backlash from the powers that be. The tennis world was not ready to give any leeway to players citing mental-health concerns.
Badosa expresses her sympathy with Osaka and her wariness over dealing with certain sections of the press. “The kinds of questions that they ask you sometimes are not the correct ones — and how they do it. It’s part of the job, but maybe they should learn to empathise more with you when you’re having a tough moment, passing through anxiety or depression. Don’t be so hard on athletes, because we’re not robots.”
For Break Point it is early days, and for many of the players it features time is still on their side. It is unlikely any of them will match the records of the outgoing legends of the game but Badosa for one is sanguine.
“What we saw, I think it’s very difficult to repeat that,” she says. “It’s a generation that I grew up with, they were my inspiration. So of course it’s going to be very sad when it’s finished, but tennis is always evolving . . . I can see change. Everyone is getting stronger, faster, more aggressive. Now you can see women serving at 200km per hour when before it was only Serena.”
For a suitable analogy we could do worse than look to tennis’s unusual and ingenious scoring system. However well or badly the first set has gone, once it is over, the scoreboard resets to love all — a clean slate. So it might be when the old guard is gone.
“We move on quite quickly, actually,” observes Auger-Aliassime. “In life sometimes you think things can’t be replaced or they’ll be there for ever. But everything moves on and you learn that the sport is the biggest thing — you’re never going to be as big as the sport. And so you need to be grateful and enjoy the moment.”
The first five episodes of ‘Break Point’ are on Netflix from January 13

Television series come and go and cancellation comes to all, eventually. But the howl that went up on social media, accompanied by the #cancelnetflix hashtag, revealed how the decisions made in the company’s boardrooms don’t always sit well with subscribers. 
The creation of Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese, the showrunners behind cult hit Dark, 1899 is set on a migrant steamship on its way to New York and concerns another vessel that has mysteriously gone missing in the Atlantic along with its 1,400 passengers. Full of ghostly portent and characters with dark secrets, the multilingual series landed comfortably in Netflix’s top 10 on its release in November. Its cancellation a mere six weeks later certainly seemed to catch Odar and Friese by surprise, as they noted on Instagram: “We would have loved to finish this incredible journey with a second and third season . . . Sometimes things don’t turn out the way you planned.”
1899 isn’t the only series to have exposed Netflix’s commitment issues. Tuca & Bertie, Teenage Bounty Hunters, Everything Sucks!, Girlboss and, more recently, The Midnight Club, Archive 81 and Resident Evil are among the series to have been terminated after one season, leaving viewers hanging. Not all were deserving of the chop: the slow-building chiller Archive 81, about an archivist hired to restore some burnt documentary footage, received glowing reviews, while the scrapping of Tuca & Bertie, the charming animated series voiced by Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong, provoked such a backlash that it was picked up by a cable network for a second outing.
It is no secret that times have been trying for Netflix as it navigates company lay-offs, fluctuating subscriber numbers and stiff competition from its rivals. While cancellations occur across all platforms, they are higher-profile at Netflix, which accounts for a quarter of original content spending worldwide (its projected budget for 2023 is $17bn to Disney’s $10.5bn). Even so, the raw number of cancellations on Netflix isn’t a good look for a service that increasingly seems like a mausoleum for abandoned projects.
It also points to a deeper problem where over-commissioning leads to series being cast aside before they’ve had time to establish themselves. Such a short-sighted approach benefits no one, least of all the viewer who is left wondering whether spending 10-plus hours on a new show is a worthy investment when there’s a chance it will be junked. 
It has long been a benefit of television that series have the time and space to find their feet. Where a film has one shot at winning over viewers, TV can be more flexible, drawing them in over time. Multi-season shows can evolve, add new characters, change tack if necessary. From Blackadder to Seinfeld and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, many are the shows that promised little in early series only to achieve greatness later on.
The decisions that lead to Netflix cancellations remain murky. Co-chief executive Ted Sarandos once said it was based on “70 per cent gut and 30 per cent data. Most of it is informed hunches and intuition.” Netflix has historically been cagey about viewer data, although it recently agreed to make figures available to the UK ratings measurement body, Barb. The top 10 rankings were introduced in 2020 for greater transparency, although the fate of 1899 shows that landing there brings no guarantee of renewal.
According to a recent article in Forbes, the crucial metric is what Netflix calls “completion rate”, meaning the percentage of the audience that goes on to finish a show, with those series scoring less than 50 per cent deemed duds. This might seem reasonable until you consider the speed at which shows are being consigned to the scrapheap. Certainly, a six-week window leaves precious little time for word-of-mouth to work its magic. 
It is understandable that, at a time of economic turbulence, Netflix is looking for ways to trim the fat. Gone are the days when it would wave a cheque at any chump with a script. But there are better ways of cutting back than greenlighting new projects with the aim of dumping early under-achievers. How about making fewer series to start with? In a saturated market, a carefully curated, less-is-more strategy could work wonders, ensuring better-quality programming and an audience not left wondering, months later, what the hell happened on that ship.

Given that he defrauded thousands of investors of a collective $19bn, ruined charities and tore apart his family, you wonder what might’ve happened had he not been such a benevolent people-person.
This rare moment of introspection comes courtesy of Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street, an insightful, incensing new Netflix docuseries. Over four episodes, director Joe Berlinger draws on the contributions of investigators, economists, former colleagues and the late Madoff himself (in clips from the deposition) to tell the story of how a one-time Nasdaq chair was able to operate a sprawling criminal racket for at least two decades until his arrest in 2008. While doing so, the show also tries to make sense of the psychological constitution of the so-called “financial sociopath”. 
The first episode provides much of the illuminating character study as it chronicles Madoff’s formative experiences and his rise from son of a struggling businessman to penny-stock trader to a Midas-like Wall Street statesman. What then follows is a comprehensive, true crime-style survey of how Madoff built his scheme and the “stagecraft” required to make his false investments and fabricated profits seem legitimate. Perhaps fearing that the material might be too dry, Berlinger superfluously supplements the interviews with several dramatised scenes — most of which revolve around a Madoff lookalike chomping on a cigar like a B-movie villain. 
The series is at its most compelling when it places Madoff’s monstrousness within the context of the systemic self-interest and greed that allowed him to flourish. Despite concerns raised from some corners of the industry, Madoff continued to profit from the seemingly wilful myopia of the banks and hedge funds he traded with, as well as the

https://www.ft.com/content/30da167e-8f2a-4797-a842-dec2a673be79,Dan Einav,"Kaleidoscope, Netflix — heist series makes the viewer choose",2023-01-04,16:52:29,"Linear storytelling is so 2022. Ambitious new Netflix heist thriller Kaleidoscope comprises eight episodes which have been devised so that they can be watched in (almost) any order. With the exception of the fixed finale, viewers are given free rein to proceed how they wish through a timeline that extends from 24 years before the robbery of a Wall Street vault to six months after the job. What some will see as a scene-setting introductory chapter therefore doubles as a long-anticipated explanation for others.
Where to begin when first things aren’t necessarily first? The overarching narrative revolves around professional thief Leo Pap (Giancarlo Esposito), who celebrates his newfound freedom after a 17-year stint in jail by orchestrating a plan to steal $7bn in bonds from an ostensibly impenetrable safe overseen by security company owner Roger Salas (Rufus Sewell). While his team have, well, seven billion reasons to risk an “impossible” score, Leo has just the one motivation: to get revenge against the man who once “took everything” from him. 
Although showrunner Eric Garcia maintains there’s no right sequence, there are episodes which clearly serve as more intuitive, accessible entry points. The “Violet” episode, for instance, establishes Leo’s back-story, while “Yellow” sees him assemble his cadre of rogues (played by Paz Vega, Rosaline Elbay, Peter Mark Kendall and Jai Courtney). More adventurous viewers may choose to start amid the chaos of “Red”, which takes place in the immediate aftermath of the botched heist.
Following a strictly chronological path would likely expose the narrative slightness of the series. With so much effort having gone into executing the show’s innovative format, Garcia has taken a few shortcuts with the actual substance of plot and characters. For all the slick direction in the various high-stakes set pieces, the writing can feel both overly contrived and under-developed.
Still, people won’t keep watching because they’re waiting for an emotional pay-off or a probing exploration of greed and vengeance — the pull is that the series offers a unique experience. Not content with just feeding a story to ravenous bingers, it invites us to piece things together in our own way and own time, and to undertake repeat viewings to see how rescrambling the episodes changes our perspectives.
Kaleidoscope serves as a kind of green television: an almost endlessly renewable show amid all the disposable content churned out and dropped by streaming services. But what about the traditional view of TV as a shared, communal experience? There’s something a little isolating about how each individual subscriber will watch the show in an order that won’t correspond to that seen by friends and families. It’s a slightly sombre realisation about a series that otherwise represents a bright start to the year’s offerings.

https://www.ft.com/content/c31e104d-0154-4508-b4c2-5c0d643bd9ae,Christopher Grimes,Hollywood talent agencies seek new deals tied to Netflix ads,2023-01-02,05:00:25,"The creative talent behind shows on Netflix’s new ad-supported service should earn more money if their series are popular with viewers, the chief of one of Hollywood’s top talent agencies has argued, a move that would represent a major shift in the streaming pioneer’s model.
In November, Netflix introduced a new subscription service in which viewers have access to a more limited selection of titles for a lower price in exchange for watching ads.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Jeremy Zimmer, head of the United Talent Agency, said this new strategy “changes the game” in terms of how the streamer should compensate creative talent.
“A show that does really well will get more advertisers and more revenue will flow to Netflix,” he added. “Therefore, our clients who created that show should be compensated for that additional revenue.”
Netflix, which launched its ad-supported service to offset slowing subscriber growth, has long resisted profit-sharing arrangements. Instead of offering traditional “back end” payments that allow talent to earn more from a successful show, Netflix buys out all rights upfront.
But Zimmer says Netflix’s launch of an ad-supported service has altered that formula.
“They’ve changed all the rules [by saying] it’s no longer an ad-free environment,” he said. “There’s a different revenue stream coming in that they had said wasn’t going to be there.” 
Netflix is likely to resist attempts by UTA or its rivals, including Creative Artists Agency and WME, to seek new sources of revenue tied to performance. However, talent agencies are trying to use the streamers’ advertising push — Disney Plus also launched an ad tier this month — as an opportunity to persuade them that aligning artists’ financial interests with the performance of programmes is good for both parties. 
The nature of the advertising business means that there will be more transparency on how shows perform than Netflix has allowed in the past. With the launch of the ad service, Netflix will now allow detailed data to be collected by Nielsen ratings — allowing talent to access more information about how well their programmes perform on the platform. In theory, this could give artists leverage to bargain for more money when they produce a hit. 
However, analysts say they do not expect meaningful profits from Netflix’s advertising business any time soon. “They’re off to a slow start” with the advertising service, said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital. “It looks like 2025 before we see any real benefit from it.” 
Netflix is missing its advertising viewership guarantees by as much as 20 per cent, according to a report this month in Digiday, which suggested the streaming service was returning cash to advertisers as a result.
Nollen noted that the ad service was still new, but he said he was surprised by a lack of promotion of the advertising tier. “Netflix is in a bit of a quandary,” he added. “They don’t want to dilute themselves” by incentivising full-price subscribers to switch to the lower-cost advertising tier. 
Zimmer said there had not been serious discussions with Netflix about profit-sharing arrangements because it is “all relatively new”. But he said when clients launch new programmes on Netflix, “they will want to build in opportunities to get compensated for shows that are successful and are deemed successful by advertisers and audiences”.
Recommended
The streaming industry itself is facing serious headwinds, including slower subscription growth and investor impatience with the billions of dollars that the traditional Hollywood groups have lost trying to build up their services. A potential strike by the Writers Guild of America when its contract ends in May could also deal a blow to studios. 
Morgan Stanley analysts wrote this month that if the streaming services launched by traditional studios were unable to deliver “meaningful” profits in the next two years, some would need to “give up and/or consolidate”. 
Some could choose to emulate Sony’s “arms dealer” strategy of selling content to streamers or even traditional TV networks, the analysts added.
Zimmer said Netflix and other streamers would do well to sell their shows to rivals. 
“All the streamers are now realising, ‘Wow, we could use additional revenue’,” he added. “Maybe those shows don’t need to just sit on our servers alone.” 
Syndicating their content to broadcasters would allow the streamers to generate extra revenue — and open another profit opportunity to the creative talent, Zimmer said. “The revenue they get from that would be a way to share proceeds from the creators.”

For instance, shows with complacent titles such as this year’s Suspect and Suspicion don’t tend to boast much creativity, while synopses promising events that “change everything” frequently don’t offer much of anything. 
A new Netflix spy thriller, Treason, is no exception on either front. Released on Boxing Day, the five-parter rather aptly feels like the reheated leftovers of other espionage adventures. This is the kind of show in which trite, earnestly delivered lines such as “Do not trust anyone” abound.
The series follows Adam Lawrence (Charlie Cox), a shining light of MI6 who becomes the youngest ever agency chief after his boss (Ciarán Hinds) is poisoned at his London gentleman’s club — presumably the security were too busy keeping the riff-raff out to notice an assassin wandering in off the street. 
She is Kara (Olga Kurylenko), a Russian femme fatale who is, incidentally, Adam’s former ally and lover. Having engineered his rise to the top job, she now intends to use him to acquire classified MI6 files about a past mission which haunts her. And while his old flame is making Adam sweat, his wife Maddy (Oona Chaplin) has started keeping tabs on her suddenly skittish husband.
Recommended
Simmering in the background for now is a political subplot about both foreign and domestic interference in elections. But every potentially suspenseful development — including the kidnapping of Adam’s daughter — is undermined by slack characterisations and exchanges which spell out, but fail to convey, the high stakes involved.
What’s frustrating is that series creator Matt Charman doesn’t come to the world of espionage from the cold. In 2016 he was nominated for an Oscar alongside the Coen Brothers for their screenplay for Bridge of Spies. How Treason could do with some of that Coen magic.

https://www.ft.com/content/6cf7a58e-e1f8-47ef-a078-1d5ed90482b1,Henry Mance,Harry and Meghan fail to deliver royal knockout in second half of Netflix series,2022-12-16,12:51:06,"Strangely, the emotion flowing around Britain’s royal family today might be relief. If King Charles and Prince William were to watch the second half of Harry and Meghan’s Netflix documentary series — they have vowed not to — they would probably find little to make them hurl their porcelain teacups at the butler.
The last three episodes of Harry & Meghan, which became available on Thursday, are marginally more gripping than the first three, which arrived last week in a blaze of publicity. But they ask as many questions about Netflix’s penchant for soft documentaries as they do about the British royal family.
Harry, the Duke of Sussex, accuses his older brother of reneging on a deal that they made years ago, not to allow their offices to feud. William, for example, issued a press release in his and Harry’s name denying reports that he (William) had bullied Meghan out of Britain. One of William’s aides also gave a statement in Meghan’s court case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which the Sussexes viewed as calculated and unhelpful. These are not the kind of things that bring down a thousand-year monarchy, largely because they concern the mechanics of media relations that are unfamiliar to most viewers.
Harry also describes a family meeting about his desire to change his royal role. “It was terrifying to have my brother scream and shout at me, and my father say things that simply weren’t true, and my grandmother [the late Queen] quietly sit there,” he says. That sounds less like personal trauma, and more like millions of Christmas lunches across Britain.
One persistent problem is that the documentary, co-produced by Harry and Meghan’s own company, Archewell, pries less than even the most fawning journalist would. We hear that after the couple’s interview with Oprah Winfrey aired, Harry received a text from William but he does not show it to the camera. The idea that Harry and Meghan were completely naive about how the media work is never questioned. This is the Sussexes’ side of the story — their truth — and that seems incompatible with journalism. It’s clear why famous people agree to do such documentaries (Meghan and Harry’s Netflix deal has been reported as worth $100mn), but it’s unclear that audiences will keep watching them.
The second problem is the apparent emptiness of Harry and Meghan’s existence. It is, of course, true that they were treated terribly by the tabloid media. Meghan says it pushed her to consider suicide. “All of this will stop if I’m not here,” she recalls thinking. Later she movingly describes how this fed constant online abuse. “You’re making people want to kill me . . . Are my babies safe?” Harry also says that he believes Meghan’s miscarriage was brought about by a legal battle with the Mail on Sunday, although NHS advice is that stress does not contribute to miscarriage. (Meghan ultimately won the case.) We see the couple doing guided meditation and being told that the press’s world is an illusion. They will need such tactics: after last week’s episodes, 15 of the top 16 stories on MailOnline were about them.
But, apart from fighting this media coverage, what do Harry and Meghan do? Harry, 38, is no longer a soldier. Meghan, 41, is not a working actor. This is a shame because they were both good at those jobs. They do have some charitable initiatives. But mainly, it seems, they are in love. In this documentary, their lives — at first in the UK, then in Canada, then, after Buckingham Palace withdraws their security, in California — revolve around family.
We see endless clips of their son, Archie, and his sister, Lilibet. Parenting is all well and good, but it does not make Meghan and Harry notable. The royal family is arguably just as empty — a mixture of meet-and-greets, fashion shows, and photo shoots. But it is cloaked in mystery and an idea of service.
This series is not an embarrassment for the Windsors, unlike the 1987 TV game show It’s a Royal Knockout. Nonetheless, it majors in clunky lines like “My entire centre was rocked to its core” (Meghan) and “This was a fight worth fighting for” (Harry). Viewers may feel, after six hours in their company, that the couple spend too much time talking about themselves.

https://www.ft.com/content/f210284f-1ccf-407e-be1a-d5036d5b370c,Henry Mance,Harry & Meghan part one review — a Netflix appeal for both admiration and pity,2022-12-08,16:06:25,"There are two ways to evaluate Harry & Meghan, the new documentary series focusing on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. One is by the flash flood of publicity. Even the trailers managed to dominate UK newspaper front pages. When the first three episodes were released on Thursday morning, the BBC sent out a breaking news alert and set up a liveblog.
This kind of quivering coverage makes the world think that Britons still have the mindsets of medieval peasants. It was also presumably what Netflix, desperate to revive growth in subscriber numbers, dreamt of when it agreed a deal with Harry and Meghan likely worth tens of millions of dollars.
But what of the actual content? Does this “Netflix Global Event” match up to, say, Diana, Princess of Wales on Panorama, Prince Andrew on Newsnight or even Harry and Meghan’s own conversation with Oprah Winfrey, in which they alleged a member of the royal family speculated about their baby’s skin colour? Bluntly, no. There have been explosive royal TV shows, but so far this is not one of them. Harry and Meghan do not drop bombs; at most, they point plaintively at existing craters. They have also bought into the successful Netflix formula: never say in one hour what you can stretch out over several. This is a show that makes you grateful that the streaming platform has the option to watch at 1.25x speed.
The first three episodes, which take the couple’s life stories up to their wedding in 2018, major in well-known, well-founded grievances against the British press. “I don’t have many early memories of my mum,” says Harry. “The majority of memories are of being swarmed by paparazzi.” The royal press corps have pointed out that some of the trailers’ footage of paparazzi either does not relate to the royals or shows coverage that was agreed with their representatives. But the broader point about the media stands. One of Meghan’s friends has it right when she asks, amazed: “Someone can just call themselves a royal expert?”
The problem is that the audience can’t help but feel confused. Are we meant to be pitying Harry and Meghan for their torment? Or are we meant to be admiring them — these beautiful young parents, in their luxurious new California home, with sumptuous sunsets and sofas, and a chicken house the size of a London bedsit?
The answer is, strangely, both. They are at once an aspirational couple and a cautionary tale about aspiration. Their love story is a fairy tale — simultaneously written by Disney and the Brothers Grimm. There is real sadness in how each of them has, in different ways, lost the parent closest to them. “I am my mother’s son,” Harry says of Princess Diana. Meghan was a self-described “daddy’s girl”, but, after her father agreed deals with newspapers, “she doesn’t have a father”, says Harry. Yet given the couple’s evident privilege, the tone is hard to get right.
So the couple insist their story is “bigger than us”. The first minutes include clips of Brexit rhetoric and a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston being tipped into Bristol Harbour. Broadcaster Afua Hirsch and historian David Olusoga (a consultant to the show) make solid points about Britain’s relationship with race and slavery.
Most of all, however, this series seeks to establish Harry and Meghan as familiar figures. She already hosts a popular Spotify podcast; they are becoming fixtures of the celebrity circuit. Viewers must decide whether they find Harry and Meghan — “H” and “M”, as they call themselves — endearing and the details of their dating enthralling.
When Netflix commissioned the series The Crown, it was a statement of intent about its ambitions in big-budget drama. Releasing Harry & Meghan is a statement of less ambition. Ultimately it cannot touch the best Netflix documentaries like Fyre and the first series of Tiger King. A series that was co-produced by Harry and Meghan’s production company, Archewell, was never going to be too probing. (The director, Liz Garbus, has declined to say if the couple had approval of the final cut.) It leaves out Meghan’s first husband, for example, and has no pushback to their various claims. The producers say other members of the royal family declined to be interviewed; Buckingham Palace says they weren’t asked.
The paradox is clear. When Harry and Meghan stepped down from royal duties in 2020, they wanted to break from the royal family, but here they are, talking about it at length. Meghan criticises royal life as “an orchestrated reality show”, apparently unaware that she has created her own. Meanwhile, the British press insists that no one is interested in Harry and Meghan, while breathlessly reporting on the couple’s every utterance.
The circus is nowhere near over. The next three episodes come next week, followed by Harry’s book in January. That surely must rely less on glamorous backdrops and more on dramatic revelations.

https://www.ft.com/content/79f7c4fa-a658-4f74-87ab-80d5ea21a92a,Dan Einav,Stutz review — Jonah Hill turns the tables on his shrink in Netflix documentary ,2022-11-18,05:00:02,"“Just shut the fuck up and do what I tell you,” a therapist teasingly implores his longtime patient in a revealing and tender new documentary based on their sessions. Phil Stutz is a sage, sweary and uncommonly direct shrink who has allowed one of his clients to broadcast his singular techniques for alleviating the “unavoidable pain and uncertainty” of life. 
The patient is the actor Jonah Hill, who also directs the Netflix film Stutz, his stated aim to give viewers the mental tools to “make their lives better”. Stutz half-seriously suggests that Hill’s documentary is actually “an attempt to gain control over me”.
At first, it does lean heavily on this transgressive shift in the usual power dynamic. Not only does Hill invite Stutz to impart his professional expertise, he also encourages the therapist to tell his own story, which he does. Hill meanwhile largely deflects questions directed back at him. 
But about a third of the way through, Hill concedes that his approach isn’t working. While making a film about being open and vulnerable, he has been keeping a distance and giving false impressions, using special effects and costumes to disguise the fact that this was in reality an agonising shoot over several years. 
What follows is a far more satisfying watch. Instead of a stagy one-sided interview, we’re treated to an honest conversation about mental health and human flaws between two men who share a touchingly warm bond. Hill now shows us Stutz’s teachings in an applied context, using them to combat his own articulately expressed feelings of loss, emptiness and shame. Rarely has a Hollywood star revealed so much of themselves.
Towards the end, Hill makes a significant step towards letting go of his profound insecurities over how he is perceived. “It doesn’t matter what people think about the movie”, he says. He’s absolutely right, but this is a bold, poignant piece of work nevertheless.

Following in the wake of the queasy yacht-based social satire Triangle of Sadness is 1899, an uncanny horror series set on a fin-de-siècle steamship.
Unlike Ruben Östlund’s film, this new multilingual Netflix show is more likely to hurt your head than upset your stomach. Created by Jantje Friese and Baran Bo Odar (the duo behind the hugely popular supernatural thriller Dark), this is the kind of sinuous story that only becomes more disorientating as it unfolds.
At first we might think we’re about to embark on a familiar narrative journey. The single, restricted location of an ocean liner headed for New York and the unlikely ensemble of French honeymooners, a Spanish priest, a geisha, and an English neurologist (Emily Beecham) seem primed for a whodunnit. Not least because it quickly transpires, with some inevitability, that almost everyone on board is harbouring a secret, and nobody is quite who they seem.
But 1899 deviates from any such expected trajectory once the ship itself is taken off course. After receiving a signal from another cruise that disappeared months earlier, the weather-beaten German captain (Andreas Pietschmann) decides to go in search of survivors. What he finds instead might be best described as a giant, floating metaphysical trap that seems to defy all logic and warp reality.
It’s easy to feel slightly lost at sea as we’re presented with an endless deluge of enigmas, ominous signs, hallucination sequences and flashbacks (or are they flashforwards?). One twist is scarcely explored before an even bigger one is introduced. And while the show succeeds in cultivating an increasingly eerie atmosphere, it comes at the expense of compelling dialogue and characterisations.
For now there’s enough intrigue fuelling this ship to keep us going along with it. It’s just hard to tell if we’re heading anywhere truly interesting.

https://www.ft.com/content/434d2cc8-8fd2-4d77-81af-b3f79a38c955,Dan Einav,Fifa Uncovered — Netflix series asks why Qatar was awarded the World Cup,2022-11-07,05:00:17,"We’re now two weeks away from the start of an unprecedented winter World Cup in Qatar. It will be watched by billions across the globe but the wealthy host nation’s poor human rights record is likely to deter many female and LGBTQ+ fans from attending. Meanwhile, the event’s $200bn expense pales next to the widely reported human cost of migrant workers who have lost their lives erecting the Gulf state’s new purpose-built stadiums.
So, why exactly was Qatar awarded the World Cup? The short answer might take the form of a dollar sign. A more considered one comes courtesy of Fifa Uncovered, a Netflix docu-series featuring contributions from investigative journalists, lawyers, and former Fifa grandees (including disgraced four-term president Sepp Blatter). Over four episodes, the show provides a fascinating, thorough and dispiriting account of the corruption that has beset world football’s governing body for decades, culminating in a 2015 FBI-led criminal indictment of 14 Fifa officials.
The first half of the series exposes how a culture of sleaze and avarice was cultivated within Fifa from the 1970s on, turning “football’s UN” into something resembling a cartel. The show outlines how the organisation’s structural flaws allowed a handful of men to leverage their disproportionate influence in presidential votes and World Cup selection committees. Major decisions were often accompanied by shady dealmaking; even the post-apartheid celebration that was the 2010 World Cup in South Africa is now partially tainted by the revelation that some senior Fifa members accepted financial incentives.
The third episode is perhaps the most absorbing as it examines both allegations of bribery by Qatar of Fifa members and the wider intersection of football and geopolitics that seemingly underpinned its unexpectedly successful bid in 2010. But the show is careful not to let compelling arguments slip into conjecture. We hear first-hand from whistleblower Phaedra Almajid about the payouts she claims to have witnessed, but there are also strenuous denials of any impropriety from Qatar 2022’s secretary-general Hassan Al Thawadi. 
The documentary, it should be stressed, doesn’t set about demonising Qatar; rather, it contextualises this year’s World Cup as an example of the broader lack of probity and transparency in football’s governance. Nor does it actively seek to prick viewers’ consciences or encourage a boycott. What it does instead, to great effect, is ask how much off-field ugliness the beautiful game can transcend. Time will tell whether Qatar 2022 will be remembered more for sport or the unsavoury background against which it played out.

Consumers will be able to pay a lower fee of $6.99 a month for the service in exchange for watching ads, as Netflix attempts to entice more people to its platform amid growing competition. 
The new service is rolling out in 12 markets this week, only seven months after Netflix shocked investors by reversing its longstanding opposition to launching an ad-supported tier. Rival services including Hulu, Peacock and Paramount Plus have ad-supported versions, and Disney Plus plans to roll out ads next month. 
Selling ads is one way Netflix executives plan to generate new sources of revenue. Its subscriber base shrank for two consecutive quarters this year, leading to a halving of its market value. 
In a presentation to reporters and investors, the company’s officials acknowledged that not all of its premium tier content will be available on the ad-supported plan. But they say shows that receive 85 to 90 per cent of the viewing time spent on the service will be available, including popular fare such as The Crown. 
Some studios may want to see how well Netflix’s ad-based service works before agreeing on whether to place shows on the service, said a person with knowledge of the discussions.
“It could be weeks after they launch, when they know more about what’s working and what’s not” before some deals are signed, the person said. 
Netflix does not own some of its most popular programmes such as Seinfeld, Gilmore Girls and NCIS, but licenses them from rival studios such as Sony, Warner Bros and Universal. 
Some of these licences — which were drafted when Netflix’s management had been staunchly against advertising on the service — do not allow for the content to run on this new service. In some cases contracts explicitly prohibit programmes from being shown on an ad-supported tier if Netflix ever decided to launch one. 
Studios have been negotiating with Netflix for months about licences for the service, said people familiar with the matter. Among them is Sony, which does not have a streaming service but has taken an “arms dealer” strategy of selling film and TV rights to the highest bidder.
“If you’re Sony, they’re going to take a pound of flesh out,” said an executive at an investment group that acquires media copyright royalties. “It’s like going to a hotel. This [room] has a view of the ocean as opposed to a view of the mountains. You’re going to have to pay more money.”
Netflix said the new ad-supported service, which will cost $6.99 a month, is not “a revenue sharing model” at the moment, but the industry expects it will shift that position soon. 
Recommended
For the studios and talent, the negotiations over the advertising-based streaming service represent a larger opportunity than just a cut of the ad revenue. They also hope to regain some of the performance-based pay, or “back end”, that they have lost in the streaming era. 
Under the current system, talent behind Netflix hits such as Squid Game did not share the spoils of their success. “It’s not like Netflix is paying me a bonus. Netflix paid me according to the original contract”, Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of the show, said last year. 
With its subscription-based model, Netflix has been able to provide far fewer data about how its shows perform than traditional TV networks do. But the company will begin working next year with Nielsen, the ratings service, to gather the detailed data that advertisers demand. 
A big question is whether this will “lead to a performance-based back end for the creative talent”, said Stephen Saltzman, head of the international entertainment group at law firm Fieldfisher. “I believe that it will put more pressure on Netflix to come up with performance-based metrics and compensation for the creative community.”

With compelling true events and a talented ensemble, it’s built on solid ground. But a more thorough survey of Netflix’s latest listing reveals a flimsy structure and a chintzy, inconsistent design.
The swiftness with which our expectations for the seven-part series give way to a sinking feeling nicely mirrors the experience of the show’s main characters, following their move to a grand, savings-draining new home in a commuter town. Having left the city in search of community and security, the Brannock family — Nora (Naomi Watts), Dean (Bobby Cannavale) and their two teenagers — quickly discover that both are in short supply in Westfield, New Jersey.
At first the meddlesome, unwelcoming neighbours just seem like a particularly waspish hive in a Waspy locale. But soon the new residents begin to receive chilling letters from an anonymous voyeur. Signing off as “the watcher”, he declares himself the property’s protector, hints at an intimate knowledge of the family and makes unsettling demands on behalf of the house. With the police oddly dismissive, the Brannocks are left in a state of deepening paranoia, turning on their neighbours and, before long, on themselves.
While Watts and Cannavale gamely do their best to bring dramatic weight to their roles, their co-stars seem content to cut loose. The cantankerous couple next door (Richard Kind and Margo Martindale), the doddery local conservationist (Mia Farrow) and the snooty, self-serving realtor (Jennifer Coolidge) are all imbued with a knowing, caricature-like quality. The actors seem to be in on a joke that nobody thought to share with the two leads.
The scene-stealing support roles bring some levity to a cumbersome narrative but they’re also symptomatic of divisive writer-director Ryan Murphy’s typical (and usually misguided) indulgence of archness and schlocky shocks. Instead of tapping into legitimate fears about safety and surveillance, the show overplays its hand, revelling in conspiracies about a local satanic cult and other grisly atrocities.
The more it leans towards sensation and excess, the more The Watcher dilutes the impact of the real story. And yet, for all the transparency of its methods — think jump scares and an insistent strings-led score — and its dated hysteria about the hellishness of suburbia, the show just about manages to sustain our curiosity. As we let another episode load, it’s hard not to feel a little like the Brannocks — sticking around against all better judgment.

The result was more than double the number of subscribers Netflix had forecast, leaving it with 223mn paying members at the end of the third quarter, up 2.6 per cent from a year earlier. The company expects to reach 227mn by the end of the current quarter, according to its earnings release late on Tuesday.
“Thank God we’re done with shrinking quarters,” said chief executive Reed Hastings during a video call with investors. “We’re back to the positivity.” 
Netflix shares rose more than 15 per cent after stock markets opened on Wednesday in New York. 
The video streaming pioneer, which shocked investors with its revelation in April that it had lost subscribers, reported a slight decline in net income — from $1.44bn a year ago to $1.4bn.

		fell 2.8 per cent to $3.10, better than $2.10 a share which Wall Street had expected. 
It also warned revenue and earnings would drop in the fourth quarter because of the effect of the strong dollar and macroeconomic headwinds such as inflation. Hastings said the guidance for the fourth quarter was “reasonable, but not fantastic”, adding: “We’ve got to pick up the momentum.” 
The company has launched two initiatives to shore up its business in the face of maturing subscription growth in major markets: a lower-cost advertising-supported streaming service and an effort to limit widespread password sharing. 
Netflix moved quickly to create its advertising tier, developing the platform within only six months in partnership with Microsoft. It will begin rolling out the service next month in 12 markets. Some analysts have warned that the advertising tier will prompt users to switch to lower-cost accounts, especially given rising inflation and the proliferation of streaming services. 
But chief product officer Greg Peters said he did not expect many subscribers to “trade down” from premium subscriptions to the ad-supported versions. “We don’t see a lot of plan switching,” he said. 
Netflix is planning to crack down on password sharing early next year, a problem it had largely ignored when it was enjoying red-hot subscription growth. The company will offer account holders the ability to create “subaccounts” for family or friends who piggyback off a single account.

With these two potential new sources of revenue, the company said it would stop providing guidance to investors on its number of new subscribers — a symbolic shift for a company whose share price rocketed for years based on its membership growth. The new ad service and its effort to monetise shared accounts mean subscriptions will become “just one component of our revenue growth”, the company said in a letter to shareholders.
Netflix’s warning this spring that its subscriber growth had gone into reverse shifted investor sentiment on the streaming video market, leading to more scrutiny of high spending on content and increased focus on profitability. 
Co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the company will hold its content spending to about $17bn per year. “We’re spending at about the right level. As we reaccelerate our revenue we will revisit that number.”

https://www.ft.com/content/93ad258e-a3d4-481a-8141-f25e50425e6f,Dan Einav,The Playlist on Netflix dramatises the implausible rise of Spotify — review,2022-10-13,14:00:58,"Is true tech set to become the new true crime? The Playlist, a new “fictionalised” series about the creation of music streaming service Spotify, becomes the fourth drama this year to tell the story of an upstart start-up, following The Dropout (about Theranos), WeCrashed (WeWork) and Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber (about former Uber boss Travis Kalanick). 
These trace a well-established rise-and-fall arc, but Swedish-language Netflix show The Playlist has no spectacular collapse to document. Nor can it rely on the gravitational pull of a central subject’s outsized ego. Despite courting criticism about royalty payments and the problematic $200mn deal with podcaster and arch-controversialist Joe Rogan, Spotify continues to grow while it, and its co-founder Daniel Ek, have generally avoided being mired in sleaze and scandal. 
All this might suggest that there isn’t much material to sustain six episodes — especially since the timeline doesn’t extend beyond Spotify’s origins in the mid-2000s. But in fact, The Playlist offers a welcome departure from the chaos and hubris. Undistracted by incident or personal histories, the series delivers a focused account of how an implausible idea to provide the world with free access to any song was made possible by a small company in Stockholm.
Recommended
Part of the appeal of this series is that it resists indulging Ek (Edvin Endre) as a singular visionary. After the first episode — in which we see the twentysomething create and sell one company (a targeted advertising service) while sitting in his underwear, before laying the foundations for Spotify with his partner Martin Lorentzon (Christian Hillborg) — he stops being the central figure. Instead, each of the remaining five chapters is told from the perspective of other key individuals: Lorentzon; Petra Hansson (Gizem Erdogan), the lawyer who rationalises with the uncompromising Ek; and Per Sundin (Ulf Stenberg), the record company boss standing in their way. Sundin opens up a broader context for the show, narrating how established labels suddenly began to lose their stranglehold over the music industry.
Things become more compelling as the various (at times conflicting) vantage points build a more textured story. But despite the sound performances and smart structure, the series could benefit from slicker pacing and sharper dialogue. As it is, The Playlist falls into a slightly sedate rhythm that’s hard to get hooked on.

https://www.ft.com/content/71994db7-6a37-4a3d-b6a8-b68a151bc81a,Alex Barker,Netflix to launch ad-supported streaming option in November,2022-10-13,18:17:53,"Netflix revealed its plans for a lower-cost advertising-supported service, betting that a $6.99-a-month option for consumers will help it shore up revenues in more straitened economic times.
Reed Hastings, chief executive, reversed his longstanding opposition to advertising support earlier this year, when the company’s once-blistering subscriber growth went into reverse in a sign of market saturation in North America.
The new ad-supported service, which launches in November, will “grow membership and, over time, build a significant incremental revenue and profit stream” across the 12 countries it will be available in next month, said Greg Peters, Netflix chief operating officer, on Thursday.
The advertising tier will force Netflix to provide metrics about viewership that it has long resisted releasing, including the size of its audiences. Starting next year it will partner with Nielsen, the ratings service, to measure and verify how many people in the US watched the ads.
Netflix’s subscriber warning this year spooked investors, who have rejected the growth-at-all costs streaming wars and are demanding to see a path to sustainable profit growth. This led Disney Plus to announce it will roll out an advertising tier in December for $7.99, while raising prices for customers who want to watch without ads. Other streaming services, including Hulu, Paramount Plus and Peacock already offer ad-supported versions.
Morgan Stanley estimates Netflix could raise as much as $3bn a year from advertising in 2026, but expects most of that to be generated by subscribers trading down from ad-free membership tiers.
“For marketers, this represents a massive increase in potentially premium video ad impressions around the world and we expect strong demand,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. “For Netflix’s growth prospects, the implications are less clear as there are no good precedents.”
While streaming services such as Hulu have in the past moved from ad-funded to develop subscription tiers, no video platform has attempted to introduce a cheaper advertising based product while keeping subscription rates steady.
Advertising executives say they have been surprised by Netflix’s speed to market and its pricing strategy. After years of resisting any ads on the platform, the company has taken just six months to release the product and opted to partner with Microsoft, a relative novice in video marketing.
Netflix also initially told ad buyers it aimed to charge $60 or more per 1,000 viewers, which is as much as twice the rate of other platforms. This higher premium came in spite of the company offering rudimentary targeting tools: at launch it will allow advertisers to tailor campaigns by country and genre.
Advertising was sold on a fixed-price basis at first, in part to allow for a rapid introduction, and Netflix said it “nearly sold out all its inventory at launch”, with hundreds of advertisers committing to campaigns. Over time the company expects the ad product to develop significantly, including through more precise targeting.
Netflix plans to show roughly four to five minutes of ads per hour of viewing, a relatively light “ad load” compared to traditional television. Part of the company’s library will be unavailable because of licensing restrictions. The streaming service expects this to affect only 5-10 per cent of shows and movies on the platform.
The new ad-supported tier will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, the UK and the US.

The California-based streaming service will launch three new mobile games next year based on Ubisoft’s games, including its most successful title Assassin’s Creed. 
The move comes as Netflix attempts to accelerate growth of its new gaming arm amid a slowdown in the company’s streaming business. The streaming group has lost more than half of its market value since April when it revealed its decade-long subscriber growth had ended.
The partnership will entail the French gaming group developing the mobile games for Netflix. This will also include a game based on Ubisoft’s Mighty Quest, a castle-building and monster-looting game, and the historical puzzle adventure game called Valiant Hearts. 
The games will be made available exclusively to Netflix subscribers, with no ads or in-app purchases, allowing Ubisoft to tap into new audiences and experiment with fresh formats for existing titles. No details of the deal value have been announced.
Netflix entered the gaming sector last year, hiring a number of high-profile executives, as it joined the world’s largest technology companies in trying to grab a slice of the most valuable portion of the entertainment industry. 
Big Tech groups including Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta, Google and Apple have all stepped up their investments in video games in recent years, vying to become the “Netflix of gaming”. 
Netflix has launched 28 games and acquired three gaming studios, including Night School Studio, which makes the supernatural adventure game Oxenfree, and Texas-based Boss Fight Entertainment. In March, it bought Next Games, the Finnish developer behind mobile games based on its hit show Stranger Things.
However, the company has struggled to quickly convert a big chunk of its roughly 220mn subscribers into regular gamers. There are about 1.9mn daily active users of Netflix’s mobile games, according to market intelligence firm Apptopia, and they have been installed 28mn times. By contrast, King, a popular games publisher that makes Candy Crush, has roughly 30mn daily active users. 
Leanne Loombe, head of external games at Netflix, said the streaming company was still “very committed to games” but was at an experimentation stage, working out which styles and genres resonated most with its subscribers. 
“Whoever our members are we want to make sure there’s a game on there for them,” she said, adding that in the future “we are going to start to focus more on Netflix IP” as “that’s what we have a superpower in”. 
The streaming giant plans to have a total of 50 games on its roster by the end of the year. 
But its push comes during a wider slowdown in the gaming sector, with console producers, video game publishers and gaming chipmakers reporting weakening sales and engagement in recent months. Last week, US tech group Snap, which owns social media group Snapchat, said it was putting its gaming plans on hold. 
Loombe said the company was not perturbed by a recent slide in gaming engagement, particularly in mobile, noting that “people are still playing games . . . so there’s still a huge opportunity for us”.
“You need a few hours to watch a TV series or films but you only need five minutes to play a game on your commute,” she added.

The statement from a Saudi-led committee of the Gulf Cooperation Council follows a campaign in local media accusing the leading streaming content provider in the region of promoting “homosexuality”.
The statement did not say which shows were problematic but said that they ran counter to Islam and the law in Gulf countries, and that they included content for children. 
“The relevant authorities will monitor the platform’s compliance with these directives, and will take the necessary legal measures if the content continues to broadcast,” the statement said. 
Homosexuality is banned in most Arab countries and is widely viewed by their populations as taboo. Authorities in several nations periodically crack down on what they consider LGBT+ behaviour or culture, often after media campaigns. 
Egypt, the most populous Arab country, followed suit on Wednesday and announced it would start regulating and licensing streaming platforms such as Netflix and Disney Plus to ensure they “adhere to the norms and values of the country”, a statement by the supreme council for media regulation said.
An official Saudi television channel had aired a report on Tuesday calling on the government to act against Netflix. “Pay to subscribe to Netflix, and in return your child will watch scenes such as this that violate morality, yes scenes that promote homosexuality among children,” a voiceover says, before showing a blurred image of two female cartoon characters kissing. 
The scene was taken from Netflix’s Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous animated show. The report separately referred to Cuties, a French film about a Muslim girl who joins a dance group and “arouses paedophiles”. 
Netflix was forced to apologise in 2020 over promotional material for Cuties after a petition accused the channel of sexualising adolescents. 
Netflix shares collapsed early this year after the company reported losing subscribers. The shares have recovered on third-quarter earnings and growth in subscriptions, although they are still well below last year’s prices. The group has retained its leading position in the Middle East, where it faces competition from regional streaming groups such as Shahid and Starz Play. 
It was not immediately clear what legal measures the Gulf countries could take against Netflix, or how the company intended to react. The governments already block access to some media companies and sexually explicit content. 
A Netflix spokesperson was not available immediately for comment. A spokesperson for the Saudi General Commission for Audiovisual Media, which had issued the statement, did not respond to a request for comment. 
The streaming service has taken down or restricted content in the past at the request of governments, including an episode of a comedy show to which Riyadh objected. 
Recommended
Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia confiscated from stores rainbow-coloured toys and clothes it said promoted homosexuality. In June, the United Arab Emirates forced Amazon to restrict sales and search results relating to LGBT+ issues, according to the New York Times. 
The crackdown came amid unease among conservative Saudis over social reforms in the once ultra-conservative kingdom that have included the introduction of mixed audiences at concerts and cinemas. 
In the socially liberal and largely expatriate-populated UAE, authorities have had a pushback from some Emiratis on social issues. A rumoured potential decriminalisation of homosexuality prompted a backlash from many citizens. Social media users have also criticised foreign embassies for raising the rainbow flag during Pride week.
In Egypt, authorities have regularly arrested people accused of homosexuality, including a round-up of concert goers in 2017 after they raised rainbow flags at a show.

https://www.ft.com/content/06a16b89-1fea-4baf-90b0-e518877ac484,Alex Barker,Netflix is starting to look more like traditional TV,2022-09-01,12:05:14,"There was a point when the world was not enough for Netflix. When the streaming service commissioned an original show, the contract would literally span “the universe” rather than restricting Netflix’s rights to just one country, territory or planet. 
The imagination of Netflix’s lawyers didn’t stop at space travel either. According to one typical agreement shared with the Financial Times, the streamer would also claim the exclusive rights to distribute the show in all forms of media “now known or discovered in the future”. 
These kind of contractual clauses were more than legal paranoia. It was part of a deliberate policy. When Netflix shouldered the financial risk of original projects such as Stranger Things or Squid Game, it paid upfront and in return demanded full ownership of the intellectual property. 
Such buyouts departed from the traditional model for television commissioning, where producers retained a stake in the commercial success of their show. The approach was yet another way in which Netflix stood out from the TV crowd.
But over the past couple of years, with little public fanfare, Netflix has been adapting this commissioning template. The concept of sharing rights is no longer taboo. Flexibility is the order of the day. 
The change wasn’t specifically triggered by Netflix’s subscriber losses, the looming “streaming recession”, belt-tightening on content budgets or the 60 per cent collapse in Netflix’s stock this year. It was a more gradual process of adjustment. 
But if Netflix is serious about greater commercial pragmatism, the shift is bound to accelerate in years to come. That will ripple through Netflix’s annual $17bn content budget and the wider creative economy. From introducing advertising to developing live programming, Netflix is looking more like the incumbent broadcasters it was created to unseat.
Netflix, of course, has been one of the great beneficiaries of shared rights. Even today, much of its library is made up of shows licensed for secondary use. Hits such as Schitt’s Creek or Peaky Blinders were first broadcast elsewhere before landing on the Netflix platform. 
This has some peculiar effects. Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator, recently examined how often shows licensed from the BBC, Channel 4 and other public service broadcasters were streamed on Netflix in the UK. 
The estimate was 510mn times in the first quarter of 2022 — almost a third of what Netflix’s own original content attracted during the same period. One survey participant told Ofcom they didn’t bother watching a traditional TV channel (free-to-air) because they could simply wait for their shows to “turn up on Netflix” (behind a subscription paywall).
Netflix has been protective of its original shows. In return for a considerable upfront fee, the streaming service effectively bought the power to decide where it is aired, and whether to develop spin-offs, merchandise, or games. Netflix, for instance, has commissioned a reality show from Squid Game, made by different producers from the drama. 
This is considerable power. Yet even for Netflix, the calculus has begun to change.
Some (but not all) producers are pressing to retain rights to the shows that they make. There is greater competition from other streaming services for talent and good projects. Regulators are intervening to bolster producer rights, especially in Europe. And Netflix has developed a better idea of what part of a show’s life cycle is most valuable in supporting a streaming business. 
Recommended
Executives making programmes for Netflix say the result is a more open conversation about rights. On flagship shows, the streaming giant has been introducing creative incentives in contracts to reward producers of successful shows. 
But for less prominent original content, it has also become more open to discussing “windowing”, where a programme maker can sell a show to traditional TV after it has appeared on Netflix for a set period of time. The gamble for the producer is taking a lower payment in return for extra rights. 
Netflix’s practices change from region to region, and indeed from producer to producer. But the direction of travel is clear. Original Netflix content might be becoming part of the traditional TV universe.

https://www.ft.com/content/1dbdd237-5e21-4f49-9a9e-0ea0171544ad,June Yoon,Netflix makes a smart bet on the Korean drama trade,2022-08-26,22:00:29,"Netflix has been the focus of two of the most lucrative trades in the past 12 months. 
Earlier this year, the market noticed it could make money from falling shares in the streaming giant. It emerged as a short-seller favourite during its peak-to-trough decline of more than 75 per cent. 
In parallel, however, Netflix has facilitated the popular “Korean drama” trade. The gains from this strategy suggest the short-selling of Netflix may be overdone.
The strategy is simple: when a new drama series starts on Netflix, watch the first episode. If you think it has the makings of a hit, buy shares of the production house at market open the next morning. South Korean drama series are typically 16 episodes long and run over eight weeks. If the series continues to be as good as it seemed at the start, hold for about four weeks — when shares usually peak. If plot twists disappoint, sell early. 
Take, for instance, the latest Korean hit on Netflix — Extraordinary Attorney Woo — a courtroom drama starring a lawyer with autism and a photographic memory. The morning after the first episode started streaming on Netflix, shares of its production house AStory began a three-week rally during which they more than doubled. 
This tactic can deliver consistent, albeit shortlived, outperformance. Similar gains have followed previous hits such as Hellbound. Shares of ContentreeJoongAng, the company behind the horror fantasy series, nearly tripled after the first episode aired on Netflix. As for Squid Game, the dystopian drama that became Netflix’s most-watched show ever, even shares of the lead actor’s agency more than tripled following the release. 
Unlike meme stocks, these gains have a firmer basis in fundamentals. Local broadcasters, which have been making blockbuster drama series for more than three decades, have largely standardised the production process, which helps to keep costs down. Squid Game, for example, cost less than a quarter of US series Stranger Things to produce per episode. Operating profit tends to climb sharply after a new series launches. AStory’s rose sevenfold in the first quarter and it now runs on margins of 16 per cent. Netflix, a relative newcomer to Korean original drama, could soon share the windfall as it starts to produce more original local content of its own. 
It needs the boost. Its shares are still down 60 per cent this year — despite a rebound that began in May — and it lost 970,000 subscribers in the quarter to June. Its forecast of new customer additions is below expectations for the current quarter. Asia-Pacific is the only area where Netflix has been adding subscribers, 2.2mn sign-ups in the first half, while losing customers in the rest of the world. 
But setting that aside, the bigger draw is that returns on its investments in shows in Asia are not confined to the region. While it is uncommon to see US content in the top 10 lists in countries such as Korea and Japan, Squid Game and Hellbound became the world’s most watched Netflix shows within days of release.
Squid Game, which cost about $21mn to make, is reported to have created almost $900mn in value for Netflix. Both the company’s shares and subscriber acquisition figures surged after the show’s launch. 
There is also room for growth. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for almost half of the world’s video streaming subscriber base. At the same time, less than half of the region’s households have a subscription, compared with more than three-quarters of US households.
Despite their closer ties to the local entertainment sector, broadcasters and streamers in the region struggle to keep up with Netflix on global distribution, impact and streaming profits. Many are still lossmaking due to rising content acquisition costs.

https://www.ft.com/content/30d9e3c0-3fb1-495c-a8c6-d044a70b87f9,Dan Einav,"Echoes, Netflix review — twin sisters swap lives in hammy box-ticking exercise ",2022-08-19,04:00:15,"I never like making snap judgments, but it’s not a promising sign when a thriller shares the same premise as a 1990s family film starring Lindsay Lohan. Echoes, a new seven-part limited series on Netflix, plays out like a twisted (and frankly less enjoyable) version of The Parent Trap. It similarly follows identical twin sisters who swap lives — a funny plot device for a pre-teen comedy, laughably contrived for an adult drama. 
Perhaps drama isn’t the right word. This is pure, disposable content that’s just about watchable enough to tide viewers over until something better comes along. Uncanny characters, dark secrets and traumatic pasts are thrown together into a Southern gothic milieu in what seems to be almost an algorithm-dictated box-ticking exercise. The result is a show both frustratingly convoluted and lacking in narrative complexity. 
You have to feel a little for Michelle Monaghan, who has not one but two lead roles with clunky scripting to get through. She plays Gina and Leni. The former is an LA hotshot with a deluxe modern mansion, the latter a small-town stable owner with a high-school sweetheart husband (Matt Bomer) and a daughter. Or at least those are the two identities that the sisters annually alternate between so that they can experience the best of both worlds. While it’s a cliché that men aren’t always the most observant, the fact that neither their father nor their husbands could ever tell a difference over decades doesn’t so much stretch credulity as tie it to a medieval torture rack. 
When “Leni” suddenly goes missing, “Gina” is left potentially severed from half of her existence. On returning to Virginia, she gets a sense that her sister had started wildly deviating from the path they’d agreed on and that maybe her mysterious disappearance was a planned escape. Faking an injury, she decides to switch back to Leni (her original identity) to try to learn why their seamless arrangement is now falling apart.
While everyone is relieved to have Leni back, the local sheriff has her suspicions about the sisters, who she believes may have been involved in a fatal church fire years earlier. Played by Karen Robinson, she brings some much-needed spark with her (hopefully) knowingly hammy turn. 
Only one other person — a man with whom one of the sisters has been having an affair — knows the truth. “What a fucking mess,” he says, on finding out that he’s talking to Leni pretending to be Gina pretending to be Leni. The more you watch, the harder it becomes to disagree.

But Disney reduced its long-term guidance for its total number of Disney Plus subscribers due to its recent loss of rights to stream Indian Premier League cricket matches. Instead of as many as 260mn total subscribers by 2024, company officials now expect Disney Plus to reach 245mn, they said on Wednesday. 
Disney stood by its goal of reaching profitability at Disney Plus by 2024, however. While Wall Street once cheered on as Disney and its rivals spent heavily on new streaming content to attract subscribers, investors are now focused on how the companies will reach profitability. 
The streaming business lost $1.1bn in Disney’s third quarter, more than triple its loss of $293mn a year earlier. 
Aiming for profitability, Disney said it would raise the price of its streaming services — which include Hulu and ESPN Plus — in the US later this year, a move that will coincide with new ad-supported versions of the services. 
The details came as Disney reported strong third-quarter results, thanks in part to booming crowds at its theme parks in the US and France, where attendance has topped pre-coronavirus pandemic levels despite rising inflation. 
Disney chief executive Bob Chapek said the strong park performance was due in part to “pent-up demand”, but he added that the rebound was “far more resilient and far more long-lasting” than a short-term recovery from the pandemic.

The results were a boost to Chapek, whose contract was renewed this summer after a bruising few months over Disney’s response to Florida’s controversial law to restrict discussion of sexual or gender identity in primary schools. 
“I’m incredibly pleased with our performance this quarter,” Chapek said, highlighting the theme park business and growth in its streaming services.

The entertainment industry has been shaken this year following Netflix’s revelation that it was losing subscribers, prompting concerns that the potential market for streaming was smaller than investors had believed. Earlier this month, Warner Bros Discovery announced a strategic shift that de-emphasised subscription streaming services. Like Disney, Netflix has also announced plans for an ad-supported service in hopes of luring more cost-conscious consumers.
In June, Disney lost out in an auction for rights to stream IPL cricket matches, which have been an engine of subscriber growth for Disney Plus. Chapek defended the “disciplined decision” not to bid for the rights, which went for $3bn to Viacom18. 
Disney shares rose 6.6 per cent to $119.90 in after-hours trading. The stock is down nearly 30 per cent this year.

Now it is annually in the headlines, not least as Angela Merkel was a regular visitor during her chancellorship (she attended the opening night again this year).
Wagner would have loved the attention and might even have approved of the climate protesters who turned up to demonstrate. He was deeply interested in politics and once fired off an article to Bismarck to interest the statesman in his festival plans. He was miffed there was no reply.
The operas themselves are deeply rooted in Wagner’s often controversial social and political beliefs. As George Bernard Shaw said, in a quote printed in this year’s programme, “The Ring, with all its gods and giants and dwarves . . . is a drama of today, and not of a remote and fabulous antiquity.” The challenge for a director is how to put that on the stage.
This year’s new production of Der Ring des Nibelungen, Wagner’s grandest work over four nights, is listed as the 16th in the festival’s history, recent years charting a distinct decline. Director Valentin Schwarz, still only 33, announced his intentions in advance: “Wagner is my Netflix,” he declared, and his Ring sets out to show us the boxed set of a dynastic saga involving a dysfunctional, modern family.
The idea is not at all implausible (Wagner’s own family and his warring descendants might not be a bad place to start). We enter a world of bling, where Valhalla is a gleaming, modern mansion and the Valkyries gather at a glitzy beauty salon. The head of the household is Wotan, an ageing playboy who keeps in trim doing his weights, but he has over-budgeted on a towering glass extension to his house. Self-satisfied family members sit around waiting for him to sort the problem out.
What a decadent family they are. Given a couple of minutes alone with Sieglinde, Wotan quickly has his hand up her dress. Siegfried similarly paws at the Woodbird, here a young girl, though he at least has the excuse that he has waited a lifetime so far to meet a woman (Mime has kept him amused with porn magazines).
There is a satisfyingly louche atmosphere to these family scenes, but not much logic. One features Freia’s funeral, but when did she die? Another shows the death of Fafner, one of the unpaid architects now languishing in end-of-life care in the living room, but why has the family taken him in? How can Sieglinde be eight months pregnant at curtain-up of Die Walküre when Siegmund has not met her yet? What is the point of Wotan not killing Hunding, when we never see him again? Some of these questions are answered in the director’s podcasts, but here is another one: why should we have to listen to those in order to understand his production?
There is also more to the Ring than the human story alone. Wagner’s libretto works on many levels and its mythological symbols are key elements that hold its wider meanings together. The challenge for a director who has chosen a TV soap setting is to get them to make sense.
Schwarz has weak solutions for some and flunks the rest. There is no rainbow bridge, no sword for Siegmund, no magic fire for Brünnhilde, no Tarnhelm (the scene in Nibelheim where Alberich undergoes transformations is painfully under-directed). The ring itself becomes a boy in a gold jersey, symbol of a new generation of hope, who is abducted by Alberich and turned to the dark side, growing up to be evil Hagen — again an interesting idea which never quite fulfils its potential. The grand final scene descends into a black hole of ideas.
How much easier it is to shut out these directorial puzzles and focus on the music. Even that, though, had its challenges, as rampant Covid and other problems resulted in multiple singers playing roles across the operas, including three Wotans, two Siegfrieds and two Brünnhildes.
The two central operas fared best. Die Walküre could hardly fail when the curtain rose on huge-voiced Lise Davidsen as Sieglinde and the boyishly fresh Siegmund of Klaus Florian Vogt, as fine a pair as Bayreuth can have seen. The two of them were pursued by Georg Zeppenfeld’s firm-voiced Hunding. Wotan in this opera was Tomasz Konieczny, whose muscular bass-baritone was doing well in Act Two until he fell through a chair and was replaced in Act Three by the expressive and tender Michael Kupfer-Radecky.
Siegfried was dominated by Andreas Schager in the title role, clarion-clear, never strained and almost as fresh at the end of this impossibly taxing role as he was the start. He is the Siegfried of his generation. His reward was the young, lyrical Brünnhilde of Daniela Köhler, a promising find. Konieczny returned, apparently recovered, as a punchy Wanderer, facing down the fearsomely aggressive Alberich of Olafur Sigurdarson, another of this cycle’s successes. 
This was a musical performance that kept the audience gripped by the narrative, exactly what the production lacked
There were some bright spots elsewhere. Christa Mayer’s Fricka exuded relaxed authority. Arnold Bezuyen played Mime, bizarrely portrayed as a collector of toys, without exaggeration and Albert Dohmen sang an almost noble Hagen. Okka von der Damerau’s Erda, one of Wotan’s former lovers also installed in the family circle, brought gravity to her pronouncements. More disappointing was the Brünnhilde of Iréne Theorin in Die Walküre and Götterdämmerung, too shrill with a persistent fast vibrato. Of the others, Egils Silins, as Wotan in Das Rheingold, and Clay Hilley, as the last-minute Siegfried in Götterdämmerung, kept the show on the road.
Not the least of the cast replacements was conductor Cornelius Meister, who took over a couple of weeks before opening night. His is a broad-brush, forward-moving Wagner and it was possible to overlook what was missing in terms of insight and expression whenever the music’s blood was up, like the white-hot forging of Nothung or the passion of the dawn duet.
This was a musical performance that kept the audience gripped by the narrative, exactly what the production lacked. We were promised we would be hooked by up-to-the-minute, primetime-TV Wagner, but by the time Schwarz had finished tying the story in knots, we were left with a half-comprehensible muddle. Netflix might like to have a word with him before he makes any further comparisons.

		letter that surprised even keen-eyed media commentators. Having previously stated that its goal was to become the next HBO, Netflix was now saying: “we compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO.” It was situating itself in a competitive landscape alongside not just TV companies, but all media vying for audience screen-time. Back then gaming was its biggest threat. Today it might be its saviour.
Netflix has continued to take video games seriously ever since, with many of its biggest shows such as The Witcher, Arcane, Castlevania and Resident Evil tied to major gaming IPs. Then in late 2021 it completed the circle by launching Netflix Games, a modest offering of mobile games available to subscribers for no extra cost. For the first six months, there were few interesting titles. Even today, hardly anybody seems to know that the service exists — less than 1 per cent of Netflix users are engaging with games. Yet since June Netflix has been rolling out a surprisingly ambitious gaming line-up, with a plan for 50 to be available by the end of the year.
This comes at a precarious moment for the company, which has suffered significant drops in share price, cut hundreds of jobs and lost more than a million subscribers this year. Are these game offerings just a desperate attempt to retain dominance in an increasingly competitive streaming market? Or does Netflix actually have the goods to claim territory in the gaming sphere and retain subscribers — or even woo a new gaming audience?
Netflix is not alone in attempting to pivot a successful tech platform into the lucrative gaming space. All “big four” tech companies — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google — have made similar moves, as have platforms such as TikTok and even Zoom. It’s a logical step as games attract a large, committed audience and often last so many hours that they can offer a boost to the holy grail of tech metrics: “engagement time”. 
The move also feels natural for Netflix, which pioneered the subscription streaming model that has now been widely imitated across TV and film. This subscription model is perhaps most impactful in the world of mobile games, which were once a reliable source of innovation but have recently been tainted by the rise of the “free to play” business model — which is rife with predatory microtransactions and employs ethically dubious monetisation strategies. Paying a monthly subscription enables developers to focus on creating quality gaming experiences rather than tempting players to part with ever more cash. 
Naturally, this strategy will only work for Netflix if the games are any good. There are currently 26 titles available across Android and iOS, most of which are casual games of little interest: Knittens is Candy Crush meets cute cats, Shooting Hoops is an odd exercise involving a basketball that is inexplicably attached to a gun, while Dominoes Café is literally just dominoes.
One of the newest Netflix-exclusive offerings, Poinpy, is a different beast. This colourful game about gathering fruit to feed a murderous monster is charming, tense and surprisingly deep. Netflix has also ported acclaimed indie PC games to mobile, including Before Your Eyes, a game about grief and memory that you control by blinking, and Into the Breach, a cult hit strategy game that plays a bit like chess with aliens and robots. Then there are licensed games. Netflix already has two games based on Stranger Things and in June it announced upcoming titles based on Shadow and Bone, Money Heist, Too Hot to Handle and The Queen’s Gambit.
With the acquisition of three game studios including Night School, creator of beloved indie title Oxenfree, and announcements of upcoming artistic games including Spiritfarer and Immortality, it’s clear that Netflix is taking its gaming gambit seriously. The company remains cagey about its overall strategy but research company Apptopia says Netflix games have been downloaded 23.3mn times. And while the 1 per cent subscriber engagement figure seems low, that still amounts to around 1.7mn daily users.
The offering of Netflix Games isn’t enough to be worth the full subscription price alone, but it could certainly sweeten the deal for those on the fence about whether to renew. It’s still early days but it is beginning to show the promise of a strong curatorial eye. In the meantime, any attempt to liberate mobile games from the shackles of microtransactions is a welcome one.

https://www.ft.com/content/b88104b7-7fc4-452c-a438-2953c1cc1883,Dan Einav,The Sandman review — Neil Gaiman’s comics become a gloomy Netflix show,2022-08-05,07:30:41,"The Sandman may be ageless and immortal, but even he would recognise that the three decades it has taken to get him on screen have been a protracted process. Since 1991, when Neil Gaiman was first approached about turning his dark fantasy comic book series into a film, there have been at least three separate attempts to get an adaptation off the ground. Now, with Gaiman’s partial involvement, The Sandman is finally airing on Netflix as a 10-part show. 
Considering that elephantine gestation period, the result is underwhelming. Or perhaps overwhelmingly tedious. While Gaiman’s bestselling 2,000-page opus was deemed by many to have blurred the lines between graphic novels and highbrow literature, this adaptation is a gloomy, intellectually inert affair. 
We begin in 1916 at the home of an English occultist who’s busy trying to ensnare Death with a spell from a newly acquired grimoire. But the self-proclaimed Magus (Charles Dance) proves himself to be a rank amateur when he accidentally summons another of the so-called Endless beings. Enter Sandman. 
Though he may look like a broody, malnourished emo rocker from the early 2000s, the Sandman (better known as “Dream” and played here by Tom Sturridge) is in fact the ruler of the Realm of Dreaming. But in the waking world he’s vulnerable and at the mercy of the Magus. Stripped of his power-giving talismans (a ruby, a helmet and a bag of sand), he’s told he’ll be kept prisoner unless he bestows his captor with a supernatural gift. Not one for bargaining, he spends the next century in silent captivity.
Eventually Dream manages to return to his now crumbling kingdom, which he solemnly vows to rebuild once he tracks down his various knick-knacks. A lengthy scavenger hunt takes him from London to Hell where he encounters a freelance exorcist (Jenna Coleman), Lucifer herself (Gwendoline Christie) and a tonally incongruous wisecracking raven (voiced by Patton Oswalt).
Other characters and subplots are introduced but little feels fleshed out after several episodes, especially since the dialogue is largely limited to functional statements in which people bluntly declare who they are, what they want or what they intend to do. Allusions to the unconscious or the necessity of dreams, meanwhile, are bereft of psychological exploration. What should be a cerebral fantasy is instead indistinguishable from countless others.
Still, it’s rather fitting that a series about the “king of dreams” seems so well equipped to send viewers to sleep.

https://www.ft.com/content/434238b1-55cc-41bf-84d4-a4d4823bd005,Dan Einav,"Uncoupled, Netflix review — middle-aged gay romcom could do with fresher jokes",2022-07-27,13:44:24,"At a surprise 50th birthday party, Michael Lawson is left feeling stunned, shocked, even winded. Which would be all well and good if he weren’t the man who organised the event. But as he guides his long-term partner, Colin, into a room full of expectant friends, the latter announces that he’s moving on with his life. It’s a blunt, callous way to end a 17-year relationship but, in fairness to Colin, a surprise party really should be regarded as grounds for separation.
So begins Uncoupled, Netflix’s new comedy-drama by Sex in the City creator Darren Star and Frasier producer Jeffrey Richman. Revolving around real estate agent Michael’s (Neil Patrick Harris) readjustment to singledom in middle age, the show is one of relatively few romcom series to focus predominantly on a gay man.
It’s a shame, then, that a release which should be seen as a sign of progress is so dated and uninspired in other ways. It’s one thing for a couple to get tired of finishing each other’s sentences after almost two decades, but another for a viewer to be wearily anticipating punchlines and plot developments within minutes of starting a new series.
More frustrating than the predictability — or Michael’s journey from heartbreak to self-discovery via the unforgiving terrain of New York’s dating scene — is the show’s reliance on stereotypes. Uncoupled may have upgraded the perennial “gay best friend” to leading man, but it seems to indulge other TV tropes such as the wisecracking black woman and the embittered, furniture-smashing recent divorcee: Michael’s colleague Suzanne (Tisha Campbell) and his new socialite client, Claire (Marcia Gay Harden), respectively.
His circle of friends — a group of Manhattanite elites including Tony award-winners, a gallery owner and a TV personality — are uniformly camp and playfully catty, while the gay community is further reduced to an endless stream of cheap jokes about hookups, boy toys and sexting. The one gag that does land involves Michael messaging a handsome potential buyer on Grindr as an oblivious Suzanne vainly flirts with him.
But any series that combines light, vaguely risqué comedy with synthetic schmaltz will probably find a viewership (as seven seasons of Netflix’s recently concluded Grace & Frankie can attest to). Harris still makes for an affable screen presence, even if his signature boyish charm has given way to a fatigued look that prompts a quip here about needing an eyelift. A better, livelier script to work with might take the years off just as effectively.

Last quarter, the streaming group shocked both Wall Street and Hollywood with an abrupt end to its decade-long growth spurt, triggering a dramatic fallout likened to the dotcom crash. 
This quarter, Netflix won by setting expectations low, and exceeding them — with the help of a new season of the hit show Stranger Things.
Shares climbed more than 7 per cent in after-hours trade after Netflix said 970,000 subscribers cancelled their accounts in the second quarter. It was the worst subscriber loss in its history but as Netflix had forecast twice as many defections, investors were relieved. 
“It’s tough . . . losing a million and calling it success,” cofounder and chief executive Reed Hastings said plainly on Tuesday. “We’re talking about losing 1mn instead of 2mn. Our excitement is tempered by the less bad results.”

		looming and inflation soaring to 40-year highs in the US, Netflix is grappling with a more cost-conscious consumer. While it previously lured people in as a cheap alternative to their pricey television bills, Netflix is now the most expensive option among a sea of copycat streaming services.
“The cost of living crisis [is] having a profound impact on all companies,” said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. “No one is immune.” 
This spending squeeze is happening at the same time that the world’s largest media and tech companies have unleashed a gutsy, expensive effort at competing with Netflix. 
“Competition has gotten to levels that are sort of absurd,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at LightShed, referring to the steep spending commitments new entrants have made. “I don’t think there is anyone in the investment community who anticipated [Comcast’s] Peacock losing two and a half-billion dollars”. 
The impact has been harsh and sudden. As recently as January, analysts predicted Netflix would add 20mn subscribers in 2022. Now, Netflix is hoping to break even for the first nine months of it.

		for the first half of this year. Its market value has shrunk from more than $300bn in November, to $90bn. 
The “Great Netflix Correction”, as it has become known in Hollywood, has triggered anxiety about the streaming business model and the future of entertainment. Netflix’s stumble has set off a sell-off across media stocks, wiping tens of billions in value from giants such as Disney and Warner Bros.
Morgan Stanley this week described the situation as the “first streaming recession”. “Streaming video revenues may prove more vulnerable than expected to a global recession and lower consumer spending levels,” warned analyst Ben Swinburne. 
Bank of America cautioned that streaming has “very quickly become a commoditised product”. 
The question for Wall Street and Hollywood is whether this downturn is temporary or if the streaming business is fundamentally less attractive than executives had assumed. 
Netflix’s second-quarter results provided lukewarm evidence supporting the former. The company is on a path back to growth, albeit by a hair — predicting it would sign up 1mn subscribers in the third quarter. 
Cancellations have been most acute in the US and Canada, Netflix’s largest market, where nearly 2mn people ditched their accounts in the first half of this year.
At $15.49 a month for its most popular plan, Netflix costs more than its major competitors, including Disney Plus and HBO Max, which charge $8 and $15, respectively. 
Netflix is also being challenged on its content. Co-chief Ted Sarandos on Tuesday described his company’s programming as “delivering hits on top of hits”. But the company has fallen behind HBO in Emmy nominations — one measurement of quality — with 105 to HBO’s 140 this year.

It is unclear how many streaming services households will pay for, particularly in a recession, and Netflix has lost its “bulletproof, must-have status”, said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. 
Already there are more video streaming subscriptions than there are people in America, with 380mn subscribers to a population of 330mn, according to data company Ampere Analysis. Globally, Netflix has previously touted a pool of 1bn potential customers who have access to the internet. Now, Nathanson warns the potential market may be closer to 400mn. 
So far this year, Asia-Pacific is the only area where Netflix has been adding subscribers. The company signed up 2.2mn people in the region in the first half of 2022 while losing customers in the rest of the world. 
Netflix executives this week appeared to be in damage control mode, taking shots at rivals and offering up data to prove its dominance. 
One example: during the 2021-22 television season, Netflix drew more viewership than broadcasters CBS and NBC combined, according to Nielsen figures provided by Netflix. Other data points were less compelling, such as Twitter engagement for Stranger Things outpacing that of Paramount’s Top Gun Maverick — a movie that made more than $1bn at the box office. 
Despite this year’s slump, Netflix remains far ahead of rivals, with 221mn subscribers to Disney Plus’s 138mn. Netflix also makes a profit on its streaming service, unlike its competitors, and expects to end the year with $1bn in free

Nonetheless, Netflix management has announced sweeping changes to revive subscriber growth. It is working with Microsoft to offer a cheaper service that serves advertisements, and plans to limit password sharing, through which it estimates 100mn households are watching Netflix for free. 
These moves won’t take place until 2023. For now, Netflix will depend on hits to carry it through the second half of the year. It will be helped by a new season of The Crown and the sequels to Knives Out and Enola Holmes. “We’re executing really well on the content side,” Hastings said. 
But the streaming group still lacks its own Star Wars or Harry Potter. Ross Benes, analyst at Insider Intelligence, warned: “unless [Netflix] finds more franchises that resonate widely, it will eventually struggle to stay ahead of competitors that are after its crown”.

In the week Netflix is releasing its biggest-budget movie, the streaming service has reported it will be moderating growth in its content spending to match a squeeze on subscribers and revenues.
Netflix will spend about $17bn on content this year and is set to keep it around that level. It would have greenlit the $200mn budget for The Gray Man blockbuster action movie, starring Ryan Gosling, in better days, when subscribers were signing up and gorging themselves on content during pandemic lockdowns.
Times have changed. In April, it reported its decade-long run of subscriber growth ended in the first quarter with a decline of around 200,000 users, as competition among streaming services increased and consumers cut back on spending. On Tuesday, it recorded a further 970,000 net losses for the second quarter, although this was good news compared to the 2mn drop it had predicted.
Great content is still key in keeping subscribers, with executives describing it as the company’s “North Star”, driving engagement and viewing “because then we can drive member growth and monetisation around it”.
Franchises are an important part of that, in order to compete with the likes of Disney+ and its Star Wars series. The Gray Man is set to become one, alongside Stranger Things, Bridgerton and others. 
Lex says some subscriber growth should return in the current quarter and the company has committed to creating a tier supported by advertising, a line that it once vowed never to cross, in order to wring more money out of some viewers. It also aims to clamp down on password sharing among its 220mn users.

		gained 0.6 per cent.
Shares in Netflix rose 7.4 per cent after it said late on Tuesday that subscriber numbers fell less than forecast during the second quarter.
The company added that it was “confident and optimistic about the future”, even as its subscriber projections for the third quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. 
Scott Devitt, analyst at Stifel, said that with signs of stabilisation in the subscriber base emerging, “we believe the prospect of a prolonged period of subscriber losses is becoming increasingly unlikely”.
Netflix’s share-price move on Wednesday ricocheted across US equity markets, pulling other film, television and music streaming providers higher. Walt Disney gained 3.8 per cent, while Spotify added 4.2 per cent and streaming platform and hardware business Roku jumped 6.9 per cent. All of those stocks had dropped sharply after a warning over subscriber growth from Netflix in late April, in a sign of the group’s perception as a bellwether for shifting consumer sentiment and household finances.
However, Alphabet was an exception to the positivity across most of the tech sector. The company erased its earlier 1.3 per cent gain to close flat after the report on its hiring plans.
It was the second time this week that reports of a hiring slowdown at a big tech group had knocked markets, following a Bloomberg report about Apple on Monday.

		meeting on Thursday. The ECB has widely signalled that it is poised to lift borrowing costs for the first time since 2011 as it tackles red-hot inflation. 
Rate-setters are expected to discuss the possibility of an extra-large 0.5 percentage points rise — a scenario that would take its deposit rate back up to zero for the first time since 2014 — but analysts remain divided over the likely scale of tightening.
“I don’t see 50 basis points tomorrow,” said Sabrina Kanniche, senior economist at Pictet Asset Management. “The growth outlook has deteriorated because of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the implications for gas supply.”

The company lost about 1mn subscribers in the second quarter, a smaller loss than the 2mn it had forecast would cancel their accounts, as it was helped in part by the release of a new season of the hit show Stranger Things. 
However, Netflix projected it would gain 1mn subscribers in the third quarter, a slower turnround than the 1.8mn that Wall Street analysts expected. 
The results come after Netflix spooked investors in April when it revealed its decade-long subscriber growth had ended, raising questions about the value of entertainment companies scrambling to compete in streaming. 
The stumble rippled across Hollywood and prompted a sell-off in shares of big media groups such as Disney and Warner Bros Discovery that triggered a more austere approach to television and movie production in the past few months.
Netflix shares rose 7 per cent in after-hours trading, but are still down nearly 70 per cent since the start of the year. 
The company has been hit by intensified competition, a more saturated US market and its decision to increase prices at a time when consumers are coping with soaring inflation.
Asia-Pacific was the only region in which Netflix added subscribers in the three months to the end of June. 
Netflix signed up 1.1mn subscribers in the region while losing 1.3mn in the US and Canada and 800,000 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
In a letter to investors on Tuesday, Netflix acknowledged that re-accelerating its growth would be “a big challenge” but defended its status as “the leader in streaming”. 
Recommended
The company ended the second quarter with 220.7mn subscribers globally, leaving it well ahead of its rivals. Netflix boasted that it also has more influence on pop culture than its competitors, pointing to higher “Twitter volume” for Stranger Things than for Disney’s Obi-Wan Kenobi television series or Paramount’s Top Gun Maverick film. 
Netflix outlined plans to jump-start growth, announcing it would next year roll out a new payment plan for users who share an account. It has vowed to crack down on password sharing, estimating that 100mn households are using but not paying for Netflix. 
After casually announcing a volte-face on advertising during its first-quarter earnings call, Netflix offered some details about the strategy.

It said it plans to initially launch a cheaper, ad-supported service in a “handful of markets where advertising spend is significant” in early 2023. Netflix this week revealed it was partnering with Microsoft to build this service. 
“Our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that’s more seamless and relevant for consumers,” it said. 
Netflix has not said how much it plans to invest in the new service. Co-founder Reed Hastings has previously been opposed to advertising for fear that it would jeopardise the platform’s reputation as a place for viewers to “relax” away from the cacophony of ads. 
The company earned $1.4bn in net income on $8bn in revenue during the quarter. It said that a stronger US dollar had resulted in a $339mn hit to revenue. It posted

https://www.ft.com/content/5d7f4c2d-cde5-47ec-9d22-dd2234db351a,Danny Leigh,The Gray Man film review — Ryan Gosling lets the action do the talking in $200mn Netflix spectacle,2022-07-14,13:00:28,"A lame-duck British prime minister and no James Bond. We live in limbo times. Into the second power vacuum at least, enter bubblegum action thriller The Gray Man. The film is reportedly the most expensive yet released by backers Netflix, Marvel alumni directors Anthony and Joe Russo wrangling a $200mn budget. 
The star is Ryan Gosling, offering a pulpy American spin on Bond, less given to quips than soulful Zen silences. “Quite the conversationalist,” notes another character. The whole part can’t run to many more than the 116 lines Gosling delivered in the famously untalky 2011 film Drive. His new role also takes from that one a particular sense of right and wrong, conveyed through close-contact brutality.
With Gosling on an estimated $20mn, you could price the performance by the word. A chunk is earned in a prologue dated to 2003. Here Billy Bob Thornton is a digitally de-aged CIA big wheel. His plan sees Gosling’s nameless convict — your sympathy will be artfully maintained — recruited as an off-the-books assassin of the US’s enemies. He will exist in the shadows, and grant Netflix a genuine Hollywood franchise. 
Recommended
Fast forward two decades to Bangkok and the opening scene proper. The Russos make it a paint factory explosion of colour, a play on the title, but also a pointed statement that this is what a streaming movie can be. Fireworks arc into a black Thai sky, the star undercover in ketchup-red suit. Make sure you watch on the world’s biggest phone. 
Cue gunplay. Yet amid skulduggery at Langley, Gosling soon finds himself unwanted by the agency — an old secret now to be erased. The flavour of the Bourne movies is implicit; Bond makes it to the foreground. Gosling’s character is codenamed Six, he deadpans, because 007 was taken. (Somewhere, a Netflix accountant tallies the cost of such verbosity.) 
The film is keen to joust throughout with the Bond machine. Climbing the ladder in the modern CIA is a slick Regé-Jean Page, the actor tipped to succeed Daniel Craig in the role. Another agent is Ana de Armas, a glittering scene-stealer in No Time to Die. De Armas and Craig also starred in Knives Out, the 2019 detective romp Netflix liked so much it bought two pending sequels for another $450mn. Among their co-stars was Chris Evans, also Captain America in the Russos’ Avengers films. Evans turns up here too, leaning hard into cartoon villainy, cast as a natty sociopath with a private security business and Watergate conspirator G Gordon Liddy’s moustache.
Such is the algorithm of brand-name stars and hit intellectual properties for which Netflix smashed the piggy bank — the familiar skilfully rearranged. In the nominal real world, the Russos swap superheroes for Tarantino-style needle drops and splashy stuntwork. Gruesome violence is mostly just suggested. The tone is more trapdoors and tranquilliser darts.
The film calls in everywhere from Baku to Vienna to Washington DC, but really only goes from A to B. The age-old rogue male storyline plays out twist-free. The audience is left to thrill at the Russos’ impersonal flash and the charisma of the stars. Gosling can still carry a movie, even if he now seems like his own tribute act. But de Armas is wasted, stuck in a backwater part. Evans gets all the fun she doesn’t.
The Gray Man isn’t a bad movie, just one wilfully drained of substance or even dramatic tension. The result is oddly sedative. The audience biting their nails will be Netflix executives. The green light for the mega-budget came back in July 2020, the streamer then flushed with imperial ambition on the back of Covid sign-ups. (The Knives Out deal came later in the same age.) Now, a franchise built on $20mn salaries is one more question mark for a company already knee deep in them. Limbo catches up with us all.

https://www.ft.com/content/e83331a0-b351-4f88-93e3-fbf33d5c206e,Anna Nicolaou,Netflix teams up with Microsoft for ad-supported streaming tier,2022-07-13,19:53:08,"Netflix is partnering with Microsoft to build an advertisement-supported tier of its streaming service, as it races to offer a cheaper option for consumers amid tough competition and soaring inflation. 
The streaming service, which had reportedly been speaking with potential partners, chose Microsoft because it “offered the flexibility to innovate over time on both the technology and sales side, as well as strong privacy protections for our members”, chief operating officer Greg Peters said on Wednesday. 
Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings had in April announced the company would create an advertising-supported version of its service. The news came as a surprise as Hastings had previously been staunchly against ads, describing Netflix as an advertising-free zone that allows viewers to “relax” without being “exploited”. 
The push into advertising is part of Netflix’s aim to reorient itself for leaner times. It has lost two-thirds of its market value since November, and analysts have likened its fall to the dotcom crash.
Disney, the other giant of the streaming business, also recently said it would launch a cheaper, ad-supported version of its service.
Netflix and Disney have the same goal: to add more subscribers. Their challenge is to ensure that the ad-supported option does not drain away too many full-price customers, while also reaching enough people to attract advertisers.
Recommended
Netflix has not disclosed what the service would cost, or other details about the product. “It’s very early days and we have much to work through,” said Peters. 
Disney chief Bob Chapek in May said an ad-supported Disney Plus is “good for the consumer because it’s going to give us another entry price point”. 
Disney has a head start over Netflix, because it also controls the Hulu streaming service, which has an ad-supported tier, as well as experience selling ads through its traditional television services, such as ABC.
Netflix in April revealed its decade-long run of subscriber growth had ended, spooking investors and raising questions about the value of entertainment companies jostling to compete in streaming. Netflix is also looking to crack down on password-sharing to help stem the decline in subscribers. 
Other streaming services in the US and globally already have ad-supported streaming, including Warner’s HBO Max, NBCUniversal’s Peacock, and Paramount Plus.
Some analysts question whether the move into advertising is a regression back to traditional television. “It is scary if the only way to reinvigorate growth is offering cheaper products that worsen the consumer experience, essentially making it more like the dying linear TV experience,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners.
The deal is a win for Microsoft as it seeks to build a broader advertising platform and become a more credible alternative to Google, which was among the advertising companies competing for the Netflix business. The work with Netflix will depend heavily on the technology and ad sales capability it obtained last month with the acquisition of Xandr, a consumer advertising platform, from AT&T.
Recommended
Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella painted the partnership as a first step towards building an ad service that supports a wider group of media companies, at a time when Google’s advertising practices have come under regulatory scrutiny. 
“We want publishers to have more long-term viable ad monetisation platforms, so more people can access the content they love wherever they are,” he wrote on Twitter after the deal was announced.
The software company would not comment on whether the alliance with Netflix would involve it supplying additional data to help make ads more targeted, beyond the customer and viewing data the streaming service has.
Advertising brings in more than $10bn in revenue annually for Microsoft, making it the fourth-biggest digital advertising player, with most of its sales coming from the Bing search engine and jobs postings on LinkedIn. It bet heavily on becoming a bigger player in the broader ad market with the $6.3bn purchase of aQuantive in 2007, but reversed course five years later when it wrote off virtually all of the investment.

https://www.ft.com/content/3e8aa095-864c-4d79-9717-8bf6a132e850,Christopher Grimes,Marvel directors Anthony and Joe Russo on The Gray Man: ‘Netflix is the least intrusive place we’ve worked’,2022-07-12,04:00:17,"The Gray Man, a new thriller by Marvel maestros Anthony and Joe Russo, has the perfect ingredients for a summer blockbuster: a hero with a mysterious past (Ryan Gosling), an appalling villain (Chris Evans) and relentless, edge-of-the seat action.
What sets this film apart from the usual summer blockbuster, however, is the way it is being released. Netflix, which financed the roughly $200mn film, is opening The Gray Man on Friday in 23 markets for just one week before it moves exclusively to the streaming service. Action fans will need to move fast if they want to catch it in a cinema.
The strategy seems especially unusual for a movie directed by two of the highest-earning film-makers in history, and for a film that is dropping just as the box office is rebounding strongly from its pandemic nadir on the back of Top Gun: Maverick’s $1bn-plus haul. 
But the Russo brothers, legendary in Hollywood for their four-film run at Marvel that brought in a collective $7bn, are taking the longer view. They see The Gray Man turning into a franchise, much like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they expect Netflix to widen theatrical releases for big movies like this one in future. 
“We made this movie as big cinema,” says Anthony Russo, 52, over Zoom from Ireland. “I think it’s going to be a very special experience for people in the theatre because we certainly built the movie that way. But we’re equally excited to reach folks via Netflix as well.”
His younger brother, Joe, 50, speaking from Idaho, adds: “I think you’ll see that Netflix is going to start incorporating much larger theatrical windows into a couple of their bigger projects every year because they see the tremendous value in the pop culture impression that makes.” 
Welcome to the upside-down world of Hollywood in 2022. After the onset of the pandemic, locked-down viewers embraced streaming like never before, sending Netflix’s stock price into the stratosphere while traditional studios rushed to promote their own nascent streaming services. Suddenly, Disney and Warner Bros began to debut big movies — most famously Marvel’s Black Widow — on their streaming services at the same time as they opened in cinemas, if they opened in cinemas at all. 
Now, in the wake of the great Netflix Correction this spring — the company’s shares plunged after it revealed that it was losing, not gaining, subscribers — old-fashioned box office revenue is back in vogue. “[Netflix] had an amazing run during the incredible stock market over the last four or five years before they hit a big bump in the road,” says Joe. “But they think like a tech company, so they can shift depending on what the market is dictating. As evidenced by the box office this summer, there’s tremendous value in the theatrical experience again.”
Netflix hasn’t announced plans to change its approach to theatrical releases, which are always brief and often done only to qualify for awards. The company says subscribers are the priority — their monthly fees pay for the content, after all — and they shouldn’t have to wait to watch movies at home. But the pressure is growing. Cinema owners are itching to show more Netflix movies, while the talent always craves the widest release possible. 
The Gray Man marks the Russos’ first foray into action films in their 25-year career, which has spanned quirky comedies (You, Me and Dupree), TV (Arrested Development), the record-breaking run at Marvel, and last year’s lower-budget crime drama Cherry, which was released on Apple TV Plus . . . 
But the brothers have been fans of the action genre since their youth. As they conceived the film they were inspired by William Friedkin’s 1971 classic The French Connection, the work of John Frankenheimer and Die Hard director John McTiernan. 
The Gray Man is based on Mark Greaney’s 2009 novel of the same name: he has since written a dozen books in the series, so it is a natural candidate for a film franchise. Joe Russo wrote the screenplay along with Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the writing duo behind the Russos’ Marvel quartet. 
“We like movies that make you forget to eat your popcorn because it’s so relentless,” Joe says. “The book had that quality to it. We love when action really highlights character or advances the story in an interesting way.” 
The Russos had wanted to make the film for nine years, but were too busy with the Marvel projects to squeeze it in. Work began in July 2020, three years after they formed their own production company, AGBO. 
The story revolves around a CIA operative, Court Gentry (Gosling) code-named Sierra Six, who is recruited from federal prison by Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton) to work on deadly top-secret missions. Sierra Six becomes a target of rogue elements within the CIA, who hire the psychopathic bounty hunter Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans) to hunt him down. The cast also features Ana de Armas as agent Dani Miranda and Regé-Jean Page as the ruthless CIA group chief. 
Joe Russo says he and his co-writers wanted to inject current themes from US politics into the film, including the idea that extremists could infiltrate parts of the US government. At the centre of this plot point is Lloyd, a sadistic and darkly comic character who was ousted from the CIA for unauthorised use of torture and a lack of impulse control. 
“He’s a highly entertaining character rooted in some modern themes — his costume and ideology is reflective of some extremist groups that have popped up around the country over the last few years,” says Joe. “He’s certainly emblematic of toxic masculinity. And his haircut was inspired by real extremist movements around the world.”
With nine major action sequences, the film was “relentless to make”, he says. It was taxing on the actors, too, particularly Gosling. “I can’t imagine a more physically demanding role,” Joe adds. “Ryan is involved in every set piece of the movie, he had to learn all of the choreography, he’s jeopardising himself every day on the set, and just physically beating himself up.” 
Now that the genre-hopping Russos have wrapped up an action thriller, they are preparing to direct and produce their first sci-fi film: an adaptation of Electric State, a graphic novel by Simon Stålenhag that will star Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown. Like The Gray Man, it is bound for Netflix. 
And while many in Hollywood are enjoying the sight of Netflix falling back to earth, the Russos praise the streaming pioneer for bringing change to the industry. “We’ve worked with everyone in our 25-year career,” says Joe. “And Netflix is the least intrusive and most supportive place we’ve worked.” 
As they discuss their future projects — which also include a push into video games following an investment from Tokyo-listed Nexon — there is no mention of future work with Marvel. When prompted, Anthony says there “might be another project in the future” but there is no rush. 
“We love everybody at Marvel and we certainly had an amazing run with them,” he says. “But we were able to say a lot in that space at the time. We’re in a phase now where we’re focused on creating new stories.”

Director Chris Williams beat the odds once already with Polynesian-themed charmer Moana. Now he has made The Sea Beast, a thoroughly admirable maritime adventure. 
Recent Pixar spin-off Lightyear inspired a painfully shrill critical debate about its shortcomings that also spotlit how rarely children are well served by big film studios. Consider this an outlier: a zesty and inventive rip-roarer for the under 12s made by Netflix without the comfort blanket of existing intellectual property.
Instead, we get nautical daredevils — and a plucky girl stowaway — dispatched by a wealthy monarchy to battle sea monsters. Williams and his colleagues bring both sides of the equation to vivid life. Giant tentacles attack gargantuan ships, their rigging seeming to reach the heavens. The storytelling too is impressive, the usual trite life lessons rejected for chewier stuff about who gets to write the history books. Here Be Monsters indeed.
But the animation is the headline act, knockout detail embedded in breathtaking seascapes. A lightning storm viewed from under the waves among translucent jellyfish is a hit of pure cinema. Kudos to Netflix for a showstopper. Still more to Williams for sneaking through such a strong physical likeness between the film’s glowering, Ahab-ish captain and the company’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos.

https://www.ft.com/content/3fb2b8ed-258e-47ee-b1e4-6ca74add3bd6,Danny Leigh,Spiderhead film review — Chris Hemsworth is miscast in Netflix’s botched drugs experiment,2022-06-16,16:00:26,"Even more so than this week’s Lightyear, a straight line runs from Top Gun: Maverick to the oddly botched Spiderhead. The film was made by Joseph Kosinski, who also directed the world’s current favourite movie; the co-star is Miles Teller, now in multiplexes as Tom Cruise’s young sidekick. The soundtrack even doubles as a 1980s jukebox. (A blast of Hall & Oates, a pinch of Thomas Dolby.)
Yet beyond that, the likeness between the films is strikingly limited. Spiderhead is a pop sci-fi Netflix curio, Teller among a batch of prisoners ensconced on a fantasy island, part of a long-term pharmaceutical study overseen by a doctor with the manner of a drive-time DJ. Just call me Steve, he insists. He is played, implausibly, by Chris Hemsworth.
The drugs being tested on Teller and friends have more elaborate names: Verbaluce for the tongue-tied, Luvactin an aphrodisiac. Others promise harsher times: Darkenfloxx and Phobica. If the choice to induce helpless laughter or gnawing terror seems arbitrary, Steve bats away protests with the fuzzy promise of a better world favoured by tech giants. Indeed, the spruce live-in lab has a touch of high-end Silicon Valley campus, the convicts a long way from jail. Or are they? Kosinski all but turns to camera and asks the question outright. (The script is adapted from a George Saunders short story.)
So much talent to get here? Hemsworth is miscast but game, Teller diligent. But the try-hard zany tone jars badly with themes of medical ethics and criminal guilt. The two sides of the film end up mutually exclusive. An ill-judged experiment itself, the movie intrigues then implodes. And then it just dissolves from memory.

Well, I tried to. My first attempt failed to navigate the repeated offers and “are you sure?” prompts in the process. My recipe box comes much less often. I’ve cancelled one beauty subscription and downgraded another. I decided against kitchen roll deliveries because, really, do I need another one of these things? I have been repeatedly annoyed by the friction involved in managing the various subscriptions that are part of our daily lives.
I am a walking economic stereotype, and one increasingly in the sights of global regulators. The “subscription economy” is heading into its first serious downturn. The rash of businesses offering consumers services or products on subscription took off in about 2011, led by TV and music streaming services and quickly followed by boxes of beauty products, clothes, organic coffee, craft beer, pet food and much more.
For consumers, the appeal was convenience or the ability to try new things, research-free. For companies, entrepreneurs, and

		investors that piled into the space, the pitch was a stickier, more direct relationship with customers that were supposedly not just less price-sensitive but also easier to upsell.
That’s about to be tested. Appropriately for a category that got its start in digital media, Netflix is the canary for this squeeze. Its shares dropped 40 per cent last month when it warned that its subscriber growth had gone into reverse. Insipid content and cut-throat competition was one explanation. But data from Ampere Analysis suggested that belt-tightening played a significant role, with evidence that younger and lower-income subscribers were leaving Netflix in greater numbers. 
The audit of spending won’t stop there. Kantar’s Global Issues Barometer found that nearly 40 per cent of households globally anticipated cutting back on entertainment subscriptions this year. But much greater numbers expect to prune luxuries, particularly in markets where inflation is highest. That will focus customers on the cost for convenience trade-off implicit in some delivery boxes: for example, meal kits are 60 to 140 per cent more expensive than buying ingredients separately or a ready meal, according to Bernstein analysis. 
Since the pandemic, there is plenty to chop: captive consumers, fear of shops and plain old boredom fuelled a boom in subscriptions. Barclaycard last year reckoned 8 in 10 British households were signed up to at least one, and put the average number per household at seven in 2020. Zuora, a subscription management platform, found the average number of subscriptions per person had jumped from 2018 to 2020 in most markets around the world, led by China. That growth was led by younger adults who were more willing to try new categories, notes Bernstein.
“I personally think there is a limit to the number of subscriptions a person will have,” says Suranga Chandratillake at Balderton, which has backed established companies such as Beauty Pie and Smol. “There is going to be a trimming of some of the stuff that is a bit extraneous . . . some [models] that were OK in frothier times will struggle over the next year or two.”
Boom-time thinking may have bestowed a tech sheen on businesses that were subject to the same pressures around price, quality and customer whim as any other consumer goods outfit. “Investors have liked . . . the recurring revenue stream,” said another VC. “It resembles software as a service.” Global venture investment into consumer subscription services doubled from 2016 to 2020, and then doubled again in 2021, according to Dealroom data. 
Meanwhile, regulators want to hold the subscription economy to new standards — in ways that could further dent bullish assumptions around customer loyalty or the rate at which free trials convert into paying customers. The US, where 84 per cent of consumers underestimated what they spent on subscriptions each month according to a 2018 study, is trying to tackle so-called negative options, such as where subscriptions roll over without explicit consent. 
The EU and UK have homed in on asymmetries between easy sign-ups and arduous cancellations (and yes, newspapers can be guilty of this too). The UK government, which wants to create a beefed up consumer watchdog with new fining powers, estimates payments on unwanted consumer subscriptions of £1.8bn a year, or about £60 per household. “It is inevitably going to become a tougher environment for these businesses,” says Ben Chivers, a commercial partner at Travers Smith.
The answer to how sticky a consumer box subscriber is? Almost certainly, less sticky than you thought.

https://www.ft.com/content/7f5a7504-314d-4fbd-8ae5-921696d63bef,Patrick Mathurin,Cost-conscious consumers are the problem for Netflix,2022-05-14,03:00:27,"When Netflix last month revealed that it had lost customers for the first time in a decade, you might have expected competing streaming services to be jubilant. 
The giants of old media have in recent years made challenging Netflix a mission. Figures for the first quarter suggest they had some success: Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers, while Disney Plus added nearly 8mn new ones.
Even Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, who for years has dismissed the fear that rival services posed a threat, admitted that they have “some very good shows and films”. 
But data from Ampere Analysis suggest that instead of a new Pixar film or an HBO show luring viewers away, the pressure on consumers’ wallets was key to Netflix’s troubled quarter.
In the two weeks after cancelling their subscription to Netflix, 87 per cent of subscribers had not signed up to a rival service, according to the analysis, which is based on around 3mn US internet users. 
Richard Broughton, director of research at Ampere, said that although there was an increase in churn rates at the start of the year, “there is no strong evidence to suggest that customers are being pulled away due to interest in other [streaming video] services”. 
The data suggest that a combination of higher inflation and a weakening stock market prompted consumers to tighten their budgets.
Many of those that left the streaming service were aged between 18 and 24, or in households with an annual income of less than $15,000, according to the analysis. About 49 per cent of the poorest households surveyed said they had a Netflix subscription in the first quarter, down from about 56.2 per cent in the previous year. 
Netflix’s loss of subscribers came after the company in January raised the price in the US for its standard plan by $1.50 to $15.49. 
While the analysis suggests belt-tightening was the biggest drag for Netflix, questions over its content may also have contributed. 
Ampere’s data point to Netflix suffering from a growing number of more fickle subscribers, or those who will cancel a subscription if they cannot find anything they want to watch, but are willing to join again when they hear of something they do.
Although an industry-wide concern, Netflix’s maturity makes it more exposed to this risk than the rest, said Broughton.

Disney added 7.9mn new subscribers, well above projections of about 5mn. That healthy increase came just weeks after Netflix warned it would lose 2mn subscribers in the current quarter, sparking a sharp sell-off in its shares and raising concerns about the potential size of the global video streaming market. 
Disney’s theme parks division also had a strong rebound, where quarterly revenue more than doubled year on year to $6.6bn, beating Wall Street projections. 
Disney Plus reached 137.7mn subscribers, while the company’s total number of streaming subscribers — including Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu — reached 205mn in the period. Bob Chapek, the group’s chief executive, said Disney Plus is on track to meet its target of 230mn-260mn subscribers by 2024.
But Christine McCarthy, Disney’s chief financial officer, tempered expectations for streaming growth in the second half of the year. “The first half came in better than expected, so that delta that we had initially anticipated may not be as large,” she said. “But we still do expect an increase in the second half to exceed the first half.”
The company’s shares were down more than 5 per cent in pre-market trading on Thursday. Disney shares have fallen more than 40 per cent over the past year, underperforming the

Disney has been weathering its worst public relations crisis in years over a new law in Florida that restricts discussion of LGBTQ issues in state elementary schools. 
Chapek, under pressure from employees, issued a statement condemning the legislation, prompting a backlash from Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor. DeSantis has since signed a law revoking the company’s special tax district around its Disney World theme park that had been in place since 1967. 
Disney reported revenue of $19.2bn in the quarter, up 23 per cent from $15.6bn a year earlier, but missing estimates because it had to pay $1bn for early termination of rights for TV shows and films. It also took a $195mn impairment charge on its Russia assets.

		of $1.08 fell short of Wall Street forecasts of $1.19 because of an increase in the effective tax rate on foreign earnings. Net income from continuing operations fell 48 per cent year on year, to $470mn from $912mn. 
Analysts expected its theme parks — which were badly hit during the pandemic — to mount a strong recovery this year, led by the US. Operating income at the theme parks unit reached $3.7bn in the quarter, up 50 per cent from a year earlier.

During the pandemic, the company replaced its FastPass service with Disney Genie, which allows customers to skip the queue for a fee. Chapek said such improvements had helped per capita spending at US parks rise more than 40 per cent from the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. “Our domestic parks were a standout,” he said.
But the company warned that closures at its Asia theme parks, including Hong Kong and Shanghai, could cut operating income by up to $350mn in the third quarter.
In the streaming business, investors have focused on costs as competition has sent content budgets skyrocketing. 
Chapek said Disney is “carefully watching content cost growth”. But he added that “great content is going to drive our subscriptions, and those will drive our profitability”. The company said it will cut overall film and TV spending by $1bn to $32bn this year.
Disney has a strong theatrical slate ahead, with Pixar’s Lightyear, the latest in its Toy Story franchise, and sequels to Black Panther and Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time, set for release at the end of the year. Its latest Marvel film, Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, grossed $185mn in the US after its release on May 6.
Chapek said the company was far along in its plans to launch an advertising-supported version of Disney Plus. Netflix last month said it was exploring the launch of an advert-supported tier, a step that co-chief executive Reed Hastings had long opposed. Netflix has not publicly said when it will be ready to launch the service.

Since signing up to the DNA-testing, ancestry-mapping service 23andMe in 2014, she has found 93 — and counting.
A new feature-length Netflix special, Our Father, stands out as a subversive outlier within the true crime genre. For one, it revolves around the creation of life not death, while the crime in question is technically not prosecutable under American federal law. But how Jacoba came to have scores of brothers and sisters within a 25-mile radius is a grimly fascinating case. 
The progenitor of all these children is Donald Cline. As a leading fertility consultant in Indiana, he helped countless women conceive through artificial inseminations in the 1970s and ’80s. Unbeknownst to them, the sperm used wasn’t that of their spouses or a chosen donor but that of their trusted doctor. “I was raped 15 times and didn’t even know it,” says one of the deceived mothers.
For the offspring, meanwhile, the revelations — unearthed by the doughty Jacoba and further investigated by local TV journalist Angela Ganote — are a source of existential turmoil. “You have no idea who you are anymore,” cries one woman, who found out after decades that she’s not her father’s biological daughter. Others fear they may have unwittingly dated a relative. Attempts to learn more about the man who contributed to half of their genetic makeup yield little solace; it transpires that the doctor who played god was a religious fanatic, likely motivated by cult-like and racialist ideologies.
Just in case the whole thing wasn’t nightmarish enough, director Lucie Jordan tries to amplify the horror by making heavy use of droning sounds, creeping zooms and a portentous shot of an abandoned swing set. These schlocky gimmicks cheapen the documentary and distract from the profound issues raised by this disturbing story.
Thorny questions around identity and genetic predestination may spark abstract debates, but Our Father is at its most impactful when it exposes how inadequate the law is in handling violation-by-deception cases. The fact that Cline was only ever made to stand trial for a relatively small charge and fined a risible $500 is one of the most disquieting aspects of the story.
★★★☆☆
On Netflix from May 11

The Tokyo market, long used to narrative blur, seized upon the unfamiliar clarity of Sony’s story. On January 5, the shares touched a 22-year peak in testament to that rarest of phenomena: a diverse group with multiple strategic bets all seeming to pay off at the same time, and crucially with conviction that the fun would last indefinitely. 
The doubts — and a 35 per cent slide in the shares — began on January 6, led by concerns that chip shortages were hurting its console business and that Microsoft’s deep pockets would make it a more formidable competitor than in previous rounds of the Xbox-PlayStation fight. But when Netflix stunned the investment world in April with a net quarterly loss of subscriber numbers and a forecast of deeper contraction to come, any residual certainties evaporated. Everyone loves an unstoppable juggernaut with immunity to a cost-of-living crisis, but Netflix now looks unsettlingly likely to be neither. The big question for Sony — now pre-eminent as the world’s all-in entertainment conglomerate — is whether that leaves it stronger or weaker.
It is easy to see why investors were excited about Sony in early January. Its games division, fronted by its flagship PlayStation5 console, had spent lavishly on tactical acquisitions of small studios — some to enhance the profit-rich catalogue of PS5 games made in-house, and others to fortify the company for intensified competition in mobile and PC gaming. In music, Sony’s decades of acquisition and catalogue-building all looked perfectly aligned for the times: especially so if artists were free to perform live once again. In films, Spider-Man: No Way Home was three weeks into a run whose global box office of $1.8bn made it the highest-grossing film of 2021 and the sixth highest ever.
And critically, both in its TV and film business, Sony seemed to have made the right call on the streaming wars. Netflix, Disney, HBO, Hulu, Apple and Amazon were competing with one another as both distributors and creators of content. But Sony’s “arms dealer” model meant avoiding becoming a streamer itself but selling its films and shows into the fray. This looked smart as long as it was generating great stuff (The Blacklist, Better Call Saul) and that the combatants were prepared to throw more money at their quest for dominance. 
But the great Netflix subscriber wobble may demand a fundamental rethink: analysts say the company will face the prospect of earlier than expected market saturation, and post-pandemic changes will benefit its competitors. 
Netflix’s strength was to slosh huge quantities of often fairly niche-interest content on to its platform to satisfy a wide range of tastes. The flagship blockbuster series of HBO, Disney and others were big draws to those services, but fewer in number and so less of a threat to the broad Netflix slosh. The success of Netflix, meanwhile, has emboldened more content providers to set up their own streaming services, starving Netflix of outside content and in aggregate, beating Netflix in their range of shows. That range will become even greater now that Covid-era production constraints are ending.
For believers in the Sony strategy, the Netflix incident is encouraging. If we are indeed entering a phase in which cost-conscious households start rationalising their streaming services, then big unattached content providers such as Sony carry more weight. The music industry, says Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal, is the model here: Sony, Warner and Universal Music were always more valuable than Spotify, and this Netflix episode should make clear to investors that content is more valuable than the platform.
Others disagree, however. Netflix’s forecast of a subscriber contraction could cement the parameters of the total video streaming market in their current place, creating a far uglier battle for market share and, potentially, scope for consolidation. If Netflix’s shareholders contract its budget for buying and financing shows, squeezing content providers, this could provide a headwind for the Sony model.
Yet that is less likely if the game remains one of beating all-comers. Before consolidation sets in, overcapacity is primarily a problem for the streaming services: as a major producer of films and TV, Sony’s arms dealer model works very nicely. Once consolidation begins, however, the power shifts decisively to the winners and Sony becomes the classic price-taker.

https://www.ft.com/content/f14ddcc3-69d1-48f8-b419-92a342c4cce4,Christopher Grimes,Silver screen fills with action as Netflix stumbles,2022-05-01,11:00:01,"After sitting in the can for more than two years, Top Gun: Maverick finally got a screening in front of a big audience in a darkened theatre this week. The crowd was all-in from the first scene, cheering Tom Cruise’s one-liners, oooh-ing at the allusions to the original 1986 film and applauding the action-packed flight sequences in which certain death was averted. 
Granted, this Las Vegas audience was heavily populated with cinema owners, who no doubt had images of long queues of movie-goers and skyrocketing popcorn sales dancing in their heads. This, after all, was CinemaCon, the movie theatre industry’s annual conference, where cinema owners are treated to exclusive sneak previews presented by A-list stars, big-name directors and studio suits seeking the widest possible distribution for their films. 
It was a decidedly gloomy affair last year, thanks to the twin scourges of the global pandemic and the exploding popularity of streaming video services. Yet this time the mood was almost giddy, thanks to optimism that the worst of the pandemic is over — and the prospect of blockbusters such as Avatar: The Way of Water, the sequel to the highest-grossing film of all time, arriving on their screens later this year. 
But there was something else lifting the mood: a sense that streaming’s blitzkrieg takeover of their industry had finally met some resistance. A week before, Netflix stunned the entertainment industry by saying it was actually losing subscribers — about 2mn this quarter — ending a decade-long streak of uninterrupted growth. 
The Netflix news unleashed what one Hollywood producer dubbed “an orgasm of schadenfreude”, according to a Puck News report. Over lunches and drinks last week in Las Vegas, Netflix’s woes and alleged missteps were gleefully dissected by studio veterans. Pent-up resentment spilled out about its big movie budgets and lavish spending on Oscar marketing campaigns. 
More publicly, however, the discussion centred on the belief that “movies are back” — specifically, back on silver screens. Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the original Top Gun and its sequel, was among those who emphasised that their work was made to be seen in theatres, not at home on a streaming service — hence the long wait for its release. 
“I always thought, and so did Tom, that this was a movie for theatres,” Bruckheimer said. “You felt it today [at the screening] — it’s a communal experience.” 
Fifteen years after Netflix launched its pioneering service, Hollywood has found itself needing to prove that the cinema is still the lifeblood of the industry. This was stated as gospel repeatedly in Las Vegas, which may not seem too surprising given both the messengers and the audience. But it amounted to a rejection of the streaming first doctrine that Disney and WarnerBros, and until recently Wall Street, have been loudly advocating. 
Disney chief executive Bob Chapek reorganised the company’s entertainment division to ensure that cinema-centric executives could no longer make decisions about how and when their movies were released. “If I left it to the individual creative groups in the company, everything would be going to the legacy platforms”, such as movie theatres and linear TV, Chapek told the FT in December. 
But as the streaming wars intensify, studios are starting to remember the joys of box office revenue. In Las Vegas last week, Disney’s studios emphasised the importance of theatrical release. Kevin Feige, who as head of Marvel Studios sits atop billion-dollar franchises such as Spider Man and The Avengers, said his team was in the process of charting its releases for the next decade. “They are unique and special — and they are meant for your theatres,” he said of the planned films. 
Jon Landau, who produced the new Avatar film for Disney’s 20th Century Fox division, said the decision to film it in 3D guaranteed that cinemagoers would have a superior experience to those streaming the movie at home. “We need to make sure [audiences] have an experience they can’t get anywhere else, and that needs to be exclusively in theatres,” Landau said. 
Disney, according to longtime attendees, put on its biggest display at CinemaCon in years. Many in the industry are still angry about the company’s decision to release films such as Black Widow for streaming on Disney Plus on the same day they debuted in theatres. Such “day and date” releases, also championed by Warner Bros, remain highly contentious in Hollywood and among cinema owners. “I am pleased to announce that simultaneous release is dead as a serious business model,” said John Fithian, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners.
Yet for all the praise for the cinema owners this week, some studio executives privately say that their failure to improve the moviegoing experience is one of the reasons attendance has been falling for years. Worse, most exhibitors are too strapped after the pandemic to make changes, even if they wanted to. 
But such concerns seemed to be put off for another day. With Netflix retrenching, summer looming and popcorn movies at the ready, Hollywood is savouring the moment. For now, at least, the movies are back.

https://www.ft.com/content/92e8f9ad-374d-4b8d-9b54-461d475458f2,Anna Nicolaou,"After the Netflix crash, does Spotify face the same fate?",2022-04-28,04:00:12,"Over the past week, Hollywood and Wall Street have been consumed by the share-price crash of Netflix. The overriding question has been: is streaming actually a bad business? Or put more simply: what have we got ourselves into? 
Other media stocks have been pulled down with Netflix — a point of exasperation among executives who have spent the past few years trying to copy what Netflix did, and believing the stock market would reward them for it. A veteran media baron quipped to me recently: “I did everything you wanted!”
Perhaps no company has been hurt more by the sudden shift than Spotify, which has lost nearly 25 per cent from levels just before Netflix’s fumble. Similar to Netflix, Spotify’s market value has been sliced down to less than a third of its pandemic high to below $19bn.
To put this in perspective, Spotify, for all its brand recognition, is now worth about the same as Cincinnati Financial, an Ohio insurance company, and significantly less than Fastenal, a Minnesota maker of construction supplies. 
I expect all media chief executives in the coming weeks will try to convince Wall Street that they are not too similar to Netflix after all. So is it fair to revalue Spotify? Spotify’s market capitalisation is about twice its $10bn revenue last year. In comparison, Netflix’s market cap of $88bn is about three times its 2021 revenue. 
There are clear similarities between Spotify and Netflix. Both were the pioneers of streaming in their respective industries. Both have managed to capture hundreds of millions of subscribers and build brands that are known around the globe. Both are under pressure to keep churning out fast subscriber growth, because their stock prices rely on this. Both have spent the past few years searching the globe for new subscribers to juice.
The similarities mostly stop there, though. The music business has very different dynamics from those of television and film. 
First, music is highly concentrated — four entities control nearly 80 per cent of Spotify’s music catalogue. TV is fragmented and complex. Dozens of studios, ranging from tiny to massive, produce the hits we watch on the small screen. 
Second, Spotify does not own its own content, with the exception of its more recent podcast push. Spotify tried to tiptoe into music a few years ago, signing about a dozen unknown artists. The major labels were outraged, and Spotify abandoned it. Meanwhile, Netflix has become one of the biggest studios in Hollywood through sheer money and will. 
Third, Spotify is selling a product nearly identical to those of its competitors. Sure, there are different playlists and interfaces. But Spotify, Apple, Amazon, Google and several others are all selling access to the same 80mn songs. Netflix, however, has different shows on offer than Disney or HBO Max. 
Some of these differences have, in the past, appeared to be a weakness for Spotify. The fact that it offers the same product as the world’s richest tech companies — Apple, Google and Amazon — has made it difficult for Spotify to raise the price of its subscriptions. Its premium subscription still costs $10 a month in the US, the same as when it launched in 2011.
With inflation in the US reaching 40-year highs, Americans are rethinking their budgets. Paying $10 a month for virtually every song on earth is relatively cheap compared with Netflix, which costs $16 a month for its standard package in the US and only offers a fraction of available television and movies. Paying $0 a month for Spotify’s free option with advertisements, may be an even better deal for some.
It’s been a little confounding to see Wall Street change its mind so quickly on streamers. Yes, interest rates are finally rising and hyped up growth stocks have seen their valuation multiples shrink. But the challenges of the streaming model have always been in plain sight. Spotify’s business is, to put it simply, difficult. It doesn’t own the product it’s selling — music. So it paid $7bn in royalties in 2021. As a result, it is a low-margin business. Spotify last year made just €94mn in operating income on €9.7bn in revenue. 
For the past several years, my inbox has been flooded with start-ups billing themselves as the “Spotify of X industry”. One reason for that might be how supportive investors have been of the big investment required to build out streaming services. Or, in other words: the luxury of burning cash. That advantage seems to be running out for Netflix and Spotify.

https://www.ft.com/content/9b5aac6f-c37f-4748-854a-83410cab24fa,Anna Nicolaou,Spotify chief distances music streaming group from Netflix ,2022-04-27,19:23:54,"Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek has sought to distance his company from Netflix, telling investors the two are “vastly different businesses”, after the recent crash in the video streaming service’s stock price sliced Spotify’s value by a fifth. 
“I think a lot of people are grouping us and Netflix together . . . despite both being media companies and primarily subscription revenue companies, that’s kind of where the similarities end for me,” Ek said on Wednesday. 
“With Spotify we are a platform, Netflix is not. With Spotify we have a free service, Netflix does not . . . it’s vastly different businesses,” he added.
Shares in the music streaming service have dropped nearly 20 per cent since Netflix revealed its subscriber growth had stalled, fuelling fears over the business model as inflation soars. 
Although Ek is demurring from comparisons with Netflix, Spotify has in the past tried to convince investors it could imitate the path of Netflix, which has been one of the most successful stocks of recent years. 
Spotify hired Barry McCarthy, Netflix’s former chief financial officer, to lead it through a public listing. He has often compared Spotify to Netflix, telling investors that the music streaming group “reminds me of my first 10 years at Netflix” and likening Spotify’s podcast push to Netflix’s initial move into streaming video. 
Spotify’s stock has dropped more than 50 per cent this year. The company has been hit by macroeconomic concerns over inflation and the war in Ukraine, as well as a fundamental reassessment of streaming as a business model. The group’s market value has shrunk to $21bn, a third of its size during its pandemic highs last year.
Recommended
However, chief financial officer Paul Vogel said he had not seen any indication that the macro environment was affecting its numbers. “We definitely think Spotify is a product that people want to continue to have,” he said. “Any uncertainty whether its war or macro, it’s always going to be there.”
The company added 2mn subscribers in the first three months of the year, even as it lost customers after shutting down in Russia and despite protests against the service over podcaster Joe Rogan and misinformation regarding coronavirus vaccines. 
The group reached 182mn paid subscribers and 422mn total users by the end of March. During the quarter, Spotify stopped billing subscribers in Russia because of its attack on Ukraine, which the company last month warned would cost it about 1.5mn subscribers.
Spotify predicted it would add 5mn subscribers in the three months to the end of June, accelerating again despite an expected additional loss of 600,000 subscribers in Russia. The company’s first-quarter revenue rose 24 per cent from the same period a year ago to €2.7bn.
Spotify’s shares are down more than 12 per cent by mid-afternoon in New York.

The drop in user figures triggered Netflix shares to plummet almost 40 per cent last Wednesday. The news had a knock-on effect on other streaming groups, with shares in Disney, Roku and Spotify also falling on the same day.
Netflix said it would bounce back by improving the quality of programming, charging households that share other users’ accounts and launching an advertising-supported version.
Financial Times readers piled into the comments beneath the articles on this topic, with many claiming to have seen it coming. A decline in the quality of Netflix’s content was the top explanation given, followed by the cost of living crisis.
Commenters debated whether Netflix was still good value for money compared with its rivals and satellite television. The issue of piracy was also raised.
There was a widespread dislike of the industry’s pivot towards advertising, with some suggesting that streaming groups should create a subscription bundle or consolidate companies instead.
A range of these comments are published below. Join the conversation by sharing your views in the comment section.
Netflix is a cheap money bubble stock which has had way too long of a run. They borrowed money to produce questionable content, they purposefully suppressed licensed content that people actually wanted so that they could push their own terrible shows. Stranger Things is literally the only thing worth watching. I don’t pay for it — I share like everyone else — but the few times I open the app I spend more time trying to select something worth watching than actually watching anything. When Netflix was TV reruns, it had value. — Economatic
It is difficult to justify dropping 20 smackers per month as a subsidy for the production of “original content” which is less entertaining than public access. — NG
The new content sucks. It’s all cheap clickbait crime documentaries and rubbish cheap trash TV shows. Gone are the days of high quality risky shows like House of Cards. — Chan
On one hand, Netflix started sticking to this ridiculous new approach of cancelling any show that reaches two to three seasons regardless of how good it is. They decided that because production costs increase after a couple of seasons due to higher pay for writers and actors that they’d rather cancel it than maintain high quality content.
On the other hand, it started pumping out the most God-awful reality shows. These are the exact kind of shows that viewers decided they didn’t want to watch when they started cord-cutting and switching to Netflix. Ironically, Netflix has now taken on the early 2000s mainstream TV approach of cheap, mindless reality TV. And they wonder why no one subscribes to Netflix any more?
How did they lose the formula so quickly? Did they start to hire a bunch of ex-network TV execs? — Tony
I subscribe in France where the choice of programming is nowhere near as good as in my native Ireland. Some excellent material that my friends speak about is simply not available on the French server. I looked in vain the other day for [Pedro] Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory, for instance. The French feed features a load of second-rate, boring material. As a result, I rarely watch Netflix in Paris and will probably unsubscribe soon. — GaelMag
I beg to differ from most here. I still find Netflix compelling. We paid Dish Network almost $200 a month for their utter garbage. Netflix monthly subscription is paid off by watching a single movie on it. A visit to the theatre is more than a month’s fee for Netflix for the two of us. God forbid we have popcorn — then it’s the equivalent of two months’ subscription. Two American-size soda puts you back a quarterly subscription. — Middle Path
Kids content is solid with Netflix. My young ones get the £10 per month value easily.
As an adult, I always pop it open, browse then close it to go find something else. — Gdjdjhdhhhheje
Where I live, in the EU, I can’t even legally buy access to certain shows — the likes of Peaky Blinders is only available via a VPN/DNS proxy hack or downloading via torrent etc.
If I have to put the effort into learning how to pirate some prime shows, then it’s easy enough for me to extend that to other shows which are legally available via streaming services. Basically the fragmentation of the market and the lack of global licensing deals means piracy is likely always on the table for those of us who are willing to pay but can’t — and then it’s a short step to just not paying for the stuff we can. — Superfluous
Netflix managed to pull off one of the best business moves in history by convincing tech-savvy people to abandon free but risky and time-consuming pirated content by having everything available instantly and without ads for a low fee. A magic trick also performed by Spotify.
That era is over as more and more companies have cannibalised Netflix’s market and the content is now siloed in multiple places and far more expensive.
The tech-savvy are fleeing back to pirated material and they are unlikely to come back. — Hjaltlander
Talk of the streamers becoming “ad supported”. They’d better be careful how they do that — no ads is one of the main reasons I subscribe to streaming services. First sign of ads in the middle of a programme, especially if they can’t be zapped, and I’m cancelling. — Stevie
More concerning to me is the softening position on advertising. If they introduce ads that would be a hard cancel for me. The ads would be driven from data mining of viewing habits, no thanks. — Xedarius
Go woke, go broke.
Not the whole story, but being preached to half the time with subliminal messages is not my idea of fun. — Credit2020
HBO Max, Disney+ and Apple TV — light years ahead of Netflix in terms of quality content. Quality over quantity and less preachy social justice lectures.
Apple, while [it has] less produced content, has an advantage — want something that’s not in their bundle? You have the option to buy pretty much anything. Netflix? Walled garden of garbage.
Prime is somewhere in between. — Ctrlaltdelete
Don’t really get the focus on subscriber growth. If you reach a certain market penetration your growth in that area will of course slow. If you remove the accounts in Russia that were shut down then Netflix added 500,000 new subscribers actually.
Focus should be on revenue and earnings growth, not subscriber growth.
Or should we focus on the number of cars sold and ask Porsche to make cars that cost €10,000 instead, so they can show incredible “growth”? — Hastings
There are going to be a lot more Netflixes as the cost of living crisis starts to bite.
Huge rises in fuel prices, and now starting to affect food prices — I saw 25 per cent on fish, 30 per cent on loo rolls only yesterday! — means that anything regarded as inessential, like Netflix, will soon get the chop. — BrentryEd
We subscribe to Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, Netflix. I haven’t used Netflix in six months. My mother in law was using it . . . I figured why am I paying for her to use it when she’s on more money in her retirement than I am . . . so it went.
Amazon Prime Video is free with Amazon Prime. And Disney’s back catalogue is also amazing and [has] constantly good shows or golden oldies coming through. Basic issue is this: perception of inflation and the doom-mongering has made me cut back on things, not because I have to but just to be prudent. Pilates is out, eating out less, haggling more. Will save us about £800-£1,500 a month in discretionary spending. — AndyKaufmann
I am going to claim I did foresee this based on my own experience as a customer of Netflix.
Netflix has a bunch of new competitors, including Amazon and Apple whose services are effectively free to many users including me, and Disney+ which I have to subscribe to to buy me some peace from my kids of a Saturday. When you add in Sky, which is much more expensive than the others, but which is also much more disruptive to get rid of, this means that we have too many services, and Netflix is the easiest to lose.
We and many of our friends have frequently discussed getting rid of Netflix for this reason in the last year or so, and discussed how they were competitively screwed; clearly I’m not claiming that I would [have] predicted its stock would specifically crater this week. — Rb2
We have yet to subscribe to a streaming service — but ever-deteriorating TV is pushing us this way. But the plethora of services definitely puts us off. So, still buying individual shows at the moment. A subscription bundle would be interesting. — Willstewart
It’s economics 101:

Now the streaming group is struggling because it turns out that its most dangerous rivals are the cost of food and fuel. 
We know that Netflix will survive — we just don’t know how. It may emerge from its present difficulties through its own efforts. It might be bought up or sold for parts, surviving in the closing credits on other platforms. Or it might just endure as a shorthand, whether for on-demand TV or sex. In that respect, Netflix could become a lot like the Hoover: once-dominant, now a comparatively minor player in its market but guaranteed a degree of eternal life as the codifying example. 
Of course, surviving as a shorthand is not much consolation if you are, say, Bill Ackman, who has walked away from his investment in the platform nursing a $400mn loss. But in terms of why Netflix actually matters, surviving as a significant cultural legacy is a lot more important than enduring as a company. 
Because the other way that Netflix is like a Hoover is that the vacuum cleaner was part of a larger, more important trend: the emergence of low-cost household appliances. That changed labour markets and societies forever: it altered the nature of domestic service and how and what we consumed. In turn, domestic appliances reshaped politics. 
The rise of household appliances was slowed, rather than thrown into reverse, by the Depression, in part because throwing away your vacuum cleaner doesn’t help save money. Streaming services, on the other hand, have, according to Kantar estimates, lost 1.5mn subscribers in the UK alone in the first three months of 2022. 
That on-demand television is, it turns out, fairly low down consumers’ list of preferred purchases right now must be a blow to Netflix’s pride. But what is more important in the long term is that no one is cancelling their subscription because they’ve fallen back in love with linear television. In the UK, the number of BBC licences fell by nearly 1mn last year.
The big change the Hoover represented was physical: a number of tasks that took days could be completed in hours. The big change that Netflix represents is cultural: a really good television programme can’t force me to rearrange my schedule to watch it, and I no longer have to tolerate the viewing habits of others. I now expect a steady diet of art house films, disposable Star Wars knock-offs and workplace comedies without having to wade through, or compromise with, anyone else’s interests. 
Politics is downstream from culture, and the fact that consumer expectations are now increasingly geared towards personalisation has big implications. Whether in reconciling different social perspectives within movements based around economic interests, or uniting clashing economic interests within movements constructed around cultural desires, successful political parties win by persuading their voters to shut up and watch the same programme at the same time. 
While the increasing volatility of British voters has many causes — not least that once voters have moved away from traditional parties they are more likely to shop around, electorally speaking — it’s surely not a coincidence that their willingness to make the initial leap comes at the same time as they have grown used to a much greater level of choice in their viewing habits.
In countries with winner-takes-all electoral systems, the growing difficulty of forming cohesive blocs has meant even the triumphant feel defeated. Donald Trump accomplished less than any previous US president with a majority in both the legislative and judicial branch. Boris Johnson’s 2019 manifesto was heavy on things the government wouldn’t do — cut spending, raise taxes, increase immigration — and very light on anything it might. Almost every consequential policy promise has been watered down or retreated from. Although Joe Biden was able to force through a huge stimulus package, he has struggled to pass long-lasting legislation because his party cannot agree on a great deal other than mutual antipathy to his predecessor. 
Nations with proportional systems have been able to outsource their problem to the voters. It is not yet clear, however, whether such political arrangements are capable of enduring policy achievement. Meeting the political ambitions of voters used to “on-demand” services might prove even more challenging than stewarding a streaming company through an era of squeezed incomes.

But now that trend has gone into reverse as rising inflation causes consumers to rethink their discretionary spending — a development that Mokhtarzada, like investors and analysts, believes will spread far beyond their Netflix accounts.
“As long as there is this much uncertainty in the economy, people are going to be increasingly cautious with their money,” said Maryland-based Mokhtarzada, whose app manages subscriptions, bills and other payments.
Last year Mokhtarzada noticed that the app’s 2.5mn users were scrapping more subscriptions, ranging from streaming services to meal kits. By March the cancellations were outnumbering new sign-ups.
This week Netflix’s share price dropped more than 35 per cent after it reported a fall in subscriber numbers for the first time in a decade. While Netflix suffered from increased competition, Steve Wreford, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, says the squeeze on disposable incomes acted as a catalyst.
“What’s happening with the streaming services is the canary in the coal mine,” he said. “Inflation puts pressure on the consumer, you think about which is your least valued purchase, and you then find out which businesses are really going to struggle in that inflationary environment.”
Inflation has gathered pace just as consumers were resuming aspects of their pre-pandemic lives — eating out, working from the office and booking vacations. It also comes after Covid-19 restrictions pushed up savings rates: Americans had built up an extra $4.2tn of cash by the end of 2021, according to the
	Federal Reserve.

Yet price rises and worries over the war in Ukraine, which has worsened inflation, have led to a marked decline in consumer sentiment, said Jessica Moulton, a senior partner at McKinsey.
“Consumers’ levels of optimism are back to mid-2020 levels. That’s a big drop from the autumn,” she said, citing McKinsey surveys carried out in five European countries and the US.
UK retail sales fell 1.4 per cent in March, the second consecutive monthly decline, as surging inflation began to bite. Inflation of 7 per cent — the rate in Germany in March — effectively cuts household discretionary spending there by 13 per cent, according to a McKinsey analysis.
The gloomier climate has cast a shadow over sectors like clothing and restaurants, said Wreford. Investors are taking note: global consumer discretionary stocks have fallen 14 per cent since the start of the year, against 8 per cent for the broader MSCI World index, according to Bloomberg data. Apparel groups’ shares have been particularly hit.
The London-based online clothing retailer Asos this month reported a sharp fall in sales growth and profits, and warned that pressure on incomes might outweigh the boost expected to accompany the loosening of Covid restrictions. Its shares are down almost 40 per cent since the start of the year.
What’s happening with the streaming services is the canary in the coal mine
Asos chief executive Mat Dunn said that “rising energy prices and food inflation will weigh on discretionary spend. The next three months will be telling as we see how these factors play out on consumer discretionary income.”
Swedish rival H&M last month also reported a sudden slowdown in sales growth. Spending on apparel has dropped below 2019 levels in the UK, according to data provider Fable.
This year’s inflationary squeeze differs from past periods of rising prices, in following on the heels of the pandemic. Consumers’ lifestyles are already in flux as they emerge from Covid-19 restrictions. Now inflation has added to pressure on companies that gained from lockdowns, like Netflix and Peloton, which have also had to raise their own prices.
The inflationary environment has damped post-Covid optimism at groups like Asos that still hope to benefit from a “summer of events, parties and weddings”, in the words of Dunn.
Restaurants hoping for a recovery are wrestling with demands for higher wages from their own staff, while the chief executive of a London-based casual dining chain said that average spend per customer had already declined in the past month.
But the same does not so far appear true of the travel industry, where consumers with accumulated savings look determined to spend them on trips they missed during the height of the pandemic. 
“Normally [in an inflationary environment] we would see an impact on travel, but there is a lot of pent-up demand,” said Moulton.
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the US’s largest and third-largest carriers by fleet size, reported record ticket sales in March, while United Airlines, the second largest, predicted that the second quarter would be its most profitable ever.
“We’re seeing no signs of any customer reticence around inflation,” Ed Bastian, Delta chief executive told the Financial Times, while Robert Isom, American chief executive, told employees this week that “demand is as strong as we’ve ever seen it”.
Will Hayllar, managing partner at strategy consultants OC&C, said that the impact of the income squeeze was not entirely predictable. “Consumers want some things that they feel good about. It doesn’t work out as completely utilitarian,” he said.
Food delivery services, another beneficiary of the pandemic, so far maintain they are not suffering from the pressure on consumer spending.
Deliveroo maintained its annual guidance for order volume growth in a trading update this month, saying it would be slower than 2021’s 70 per cent but still growing by 15-25 per cent on a constant currency basis.
Jitse Groen, chief executive of Just Eat Takeaway, insisted this week that food price inflation could be a net benefit: when restaurants’ prices go up, so too does Just Eat’s commission.
But David Reynolds, analyst at Irish investment bank Davy, said: “We are moving into uncharted territory. Ordinarily online takeaway food proves to be fairly resilient in the face of inflationary pressures and dining out bears the brunt.
“But with double-digit inflation not impossible, there must be risks that consumers drop some or all takeaway food orders.”
Analysts agree that inflation has not yet peaked, and that its full impact is only just starting to be felt. While pandemic savings will cushion some wealthier consumers for a time, those on lower incomes will be the first to feel the squeeze as staples account for a higher proportion of their disposable incomes, said Wreford.
Makers of branded consumer staples have so far succeeded in passing price rises on to consumers: Nestlé, Heineken, Danone and Procter & Gamble all said this week they had increased prices by about 5 per cent in the three months to March, without pushing down sales.
But as the pressure grows, households may switch to private-label products. “Consumer down-trading is looking increasingly likely as discretionary spend gets squeezed . . . Premium brands will likely hold up, as will value, but ‘me too’ mass brands are at risk,” said Warren Ackerman, analyst at Barclays.
Some businesses hope to benefit from consumers seeking cheap alternatives.
Mooky Greidinger, chief executive of Cineworld, the world’s second largest cinema chain, is betting that cinemas, unlike Netflix, will benefit from lower discretionary spend: “In view of

		[consumers] cannot afford the same trips abroad or a £100 ticket musical but they can afford a £10 ticket to the cinema. I’m not worried at all,” he told the FT last month.
At the opposite end of the scale, fund managers expect luxury goods makers to weather the storm, as their margins are high and wealthy buyers cushioned from inflation’s worst effects.
Groups such as France-based LVMH “have consistently been able to raise prices to more than offset the inflationary pressures”, said Marcus Morris-Eyton, fund manager at Allianz.
Yet Mokhtarzada said Truebill’s customer base, which slants towards younger users, has already shown a marked cut in spending: on both petrol and groceries, the rise in total spending has lagged behind the rises in prices, indicating a more prudent approach. “That has to indicate a change in consumer behaviour,” he said.

Netflix and the future of streaming,2022-04-22,16:37:02,"It is a basic formula in the television business: make a hit show, renew it and lock in ever bigger audiences. But Netflix, which has spent more than 20 years upending the rules of the entertainment business, may have found a way to defy even this convention.
This spring the streaming service will roll out the latest, highly awaited instalments of two of its most popular series, Ozark and Stranger Things. Yet instead of a boost to its subscriber base, Netflix said this week it expected to lose about 2mn paying customers in the coming months, thanks to a combination of intensifying competition, a maturing US market and its decision to increase prices at a moment when consumers are coping with rising inflation. 
Cost: $14.99 per month
Subscribers: 175mn (estimated as April 2022)
Hits include: The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, Reacher, Good Omens
Cost: $4.99 per month
Monthly users: 20mn (estimated as July 2021)
Hits: Oscar winner Coda, Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Severance
After years of bending Hollywood to its will, Netflix finally fell to earth this week as it revealed that its blistering, decade-long streak of subscription growth had come to an end. Its share price fell almost 40 per cent, leaving its market cap at about $97bn — down from $300bn in November.
The news served as a gut check for the streaming industry that has grown in Netflix’s wake. The company’s extraordinary success inspired many of America’s largest media conglomerates to launch or buy their own streaming platforms, including Disney’s Hulu and Disney Plus; Warner Bros Discovery’s HBO Max; NBCUniversal’s Peacock and Paramount’s Paramount Plus. Tech groups Amazon and Apple also launched their own streaming services and content studios in a bid to emulate Netflix’s groundbreaking model.
That model transformed the television and movie industries and launched a fiercely competitive war for subscribers. But the streaming industry’s growth rested on the assumption that there is a global market of up to 1bn households willing to pay for services. Now, some analysts say the actual market may be far smaller — and that it is time for a rethink of the streaming business that Netflix pioneered. 
Netflix’s subscriber warning was “almost like an acknowledgment . . . that this isn’t that great of a business”, said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson and a longtime sceptic of the Netflix model. “It makes you really wonder if the media companies should roll back some of their ambition to be like Netflix.”
The grim Netflix results appeared to signal the end of a lavish, experimental era of streaming characterised by fast growth, unrestrained spending and a healthy dose of hubris. 
Cost: $9.99Subscribers: 221mn (as March 2022)Hits include: Bridgerton, Stranger Things, Anatomy of a Scandal
Cost: $7.99Subscribers: 130mn (as Jan 2022)Hits include: Marvel and Star Wars movies and TV shows, Disney and Pixar catalogue, Fox TV shows
When Netflix launched its streaming service in the US in 2007, it was positioned as a new format that would free viewers from the stale conventions of mainstream television and the steep costs and rigid schedules of premium cable.
Initially Netflix offered subscribers access to pre-existing movies and TV shows licensed from other creators. But in 2012, the same year it launched in the UK, it began developing its own content, scoring an early hit with the Washington political drama House of Cards. Netflix upended the traditional model of television by releasing all its episodes at once, rather than week by week, so viewers could binge-watch entire series in one sitting. 
The platform proved wildly successful. In the 10 years since, it has reached almost 222mn subscribers in 190 countries, up more than 750 per cent, and it became profitable for the first time late last year.

		run, allowing the company to spend heavily so long as investors believed in the strategy. In an environment of low interest rates, investors searching for yield happily purchased Netflix bonds, funding the company’s spending spree on content. 
From 2018 through 2021, Netflix poured $55bn into television shows and movies as it raced to compete with major networks and Hollywood studios. Netflix’s push triggered an industry-wide land grab in which every company had to spend big to win. In 2019, Amazon splashed out $1bn on a single TV show — an adaptation of The Lord of the Rings said to be the most expensive show in history. 
“One of the reasons [everyone] invested so heavily [from 2017- 2019] was the theory that for the next two or three years, it was all about acquiring subscribers,” said the former head of a big streaming service. “That window of time was when people were going to make the switch. You had to get them. Netflix knew it.” 
But the content arms race has only spiralled, as new, deep-pocketed players entered the market and people stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic boosted viewership numbers. US media groups are together expected to spend upwards of $100bn on content this year. Netflix alone accounts for $17bn of that.
These sums are “historic [and] precedent-setting”, says Tom Nunan, professor at UCLA’s School of Theater, Film and Television, and executive producer of the Oscar-winning film Crash. “These are the types of numbers more associated with the Department of Defense. From single companies like these it’s almost unimaginable — but the numbers are certainly unsustainable.” 
Until recently, Wall Street was cheering the lavish spending on streaming. After Disney unveiled a slate of Disney Plus programming based on Marvel and Star Wars properties in December 2020, for example, its stock briefly hit a record high.
But the sentiment has now changed. A canary in the coal mine moment for the streaming industry came in February this year, when Paramount executives announced big investments into their Paramount Plus streaming service and saw their share price plummet almost 20 per cent the following day. 
Wall Street was unconvinced then that a shift to streaming would improve Paramount’s

		 But the Netflix announcement this month seemed to confirm something for investors: that no matter how great the programming, it is unlikely that the streaming industry will ever generate the kinds of profits that television and film groups made in the pre-streaming era. 
“It’s absolutely a lesser economic model [than cable television],” said the former head of a big streaming service. “The pricing you have to get to in order to duplicate the [cable] market is astronomical.” 
Netflix announced a number of measures this week to try to weather the slowdown in subscriber numbers. During Tuesday’s video call with investors, Spencer Neumann, Netflix chief financial officer, said the company would “pull back on some of our spending growth”, though company officials say it will continue to outspend its rivals in the industry on making new films and series. 
The company will also lift its long-stated opposition to advertising on the Netflix platform, with Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings suggesting a cheaper, ad-supported service could be available in a year or two. 
“I’ve been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,” Hastings said on Tuesday. “But as much as I’m a fan of that, I’m a bigger fan of consumer choice.” 
But the biggest improvement Netflix needed to make, Hastings indicated, was improving the quality of its programming — the side of the business overseen by co-chief executive Ted Sarandos. 
Analysts agree. “Netflix should be creating significantly more must-see TV series and movies that become ongoing franchises,” Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed, wrote in a research note this week. “Netflix’s content, especially its English-language content, is simply not resonating relative to the level of spend.”
This is where Netflix is facing the stiffest competition from its rival streaming services run by long-established content creators HBO, Disney, NBCUniversal and Paramount — not to mention wealthy Amazon and Apple, who are unlikely to need to rein in spending any time soon. 
Sarandos, who has worked hard to weave Netflix into the fabric of Hollywood, sounded defensive this week about the need to improve its programming. He claimed that Netflix films such as Don’t Look Up, Red Notice and Adam Project are among “the most popular and most watched movies in the world” (though, as the company does not release viewing figures, investors will have to take his word for it).
He reminded investors that the company was still the new kid on the block in terms of content creation. “We’ve been doing this for a decade,” he said. “That’s about 90 years less time than all of our competitors have been at it.” 
But Wall Street may have run out of patience. Already, some analysts are urging the company’s rivals to rethink their spending on streaming. Noting that Sony has been making money by selling its films and TV shows to streaming companies — the so-called “arms dealer” strategy — Greenfield suggested that some of the traditional studios consider giving up on streaming and become content suppliers instead. 
“While it feels hard to fathom abandoning streaming ambitions with so much capital committed to original streaming programming over the next several years, we wonder if that is the hard decision management teams such as NBCUniversal and Paramount should make?” Greenfield wrote.

Energy saving tips are an increasingly hot topic — no matter your level of income. 
Following April’s 54 per cent increase to the energy price cap, I expected my bills to increase, but I wasn’t expecting my monthly direct debit to more than double. 
My supplier claims this is based on my current usage and will prevent my account from being in the red by the time autumn arrives — at which point, energy prices are forecast to soar further. 
I’ve challenged the 112 per cent increase, although I could afford to pay it. Others are dealing with the “price shock” of soaring bills by cancelling Netflix subscriptions; AJ Bell has warned people are investing less; retail sales are plummeting and consumer confidence has plunged to a near-record low.
But what if you have no slack in your budget?
Gemma Hatvani is a woman who knows. Made redundant after working as a business analyst in the energy industry for 16 years, she set up a Facebook group — Energy Support and Advice UK — to help people struggling to pay their bills. 
“I wanted to give something back, and use my knowledge to help people — and it’s grown and grown,” she says. 
The group’s 15 full-time volunteers include energy experts and heating engineers advising on how to get bills down — plus what to do if you can’t afford to pay. 
Growing numbers are saying that cancelling their direct debit and paying what they can every month is the only way they can still afford to live
Its community of 50,000 members share tips about the benefits of bleeding radiators, installing timer switches to turn off broadband routers at night and hanging curtains over doorways to stop drafts. 
However, the heartbreaking extremes to which some go to cut their consumption and save money caused the group to go viral this week. 
“Leave a bowl of water in the sun with a black bin liner on top and it will be warm enough to wash up in later,” was one tip widely shared on Twitter, highlighting the miserable reality of life for those who cannot afford to top up expensive prepayment meters. 
Hatvani is aware of the increasingly desperate lengths people go to, including going to bed fully dressed, using candles placed on a gas hob to heat food, storing leftover boiled water from the kettle in a Thermos or building a homemade hay box (a thermal cooking technique from the postwar era). 
“I keep having to remind myself it’s 2022,” she says. “It’s like Bear Grylls out there — we’re talking about survival.” 
Numbers in the Facebook group have surged since April’s bill hikes, and are set to increase further now that Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, has become a member.
He has been warning for some time that lower income households will either “freeze or starve” this winter unless more government help is forthcoming. This week, the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy firms told MPs of the “totally horrific” consequences if the price cap rises from £1,971 to the expected level of £2,600 in October. 
By then, Eon expects up to 40 per cent of its customers to be in fuel poverty — spending more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills — the House of Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee heard on Tuesday. 
Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said the crisis was moving “beyond what I think this industry can deal with”, adding the firm had been contacted by thousands of customers unable to pay their bills since April’s increases, even as consumption falls during the summer months. 
Chris O’Shea, boss of British Gas owner Centrica, said the number of customers late with payments had risen by 125,000 to 716,000 over the past year.
The goings-on in Hatvani’s group are a sober reminder of the toll this is going to take on the personal finances of millions of people. 
Donate to the Financial Literacy & Inclusion Campaign here
There are hundreds of posts a week now from people who cannot afford huge increases to their direct debits, who are seeking advice about how to challenge energy companies. Hatvani’s sister has seen her unit rate for gas climb by over 600 per cent after coming off a fixed-rate deal. “Her supplier wants £500 a month for gas and electric, which is totally unaffordable and more than her rent,” she says. 
Faced with huge increases, growing numbers of members are saying that cancelling their direct debit and paying what they can every month is the only way they can still afford to live — despite the dire financial consequences.
Expert volunteers point out this will immediately make bills more expensive, wiping out the direct debit discount most suppliers offer, and could prematurely end advantageous fixed-rate deals. 
As energy debts mount up, Hatvani foresees millions more households being pressed to switch to more expensive prepayment meters, where they are charged for energy usage upfront. This week, she spoke to a young family who had resisted having one installed, only to be issued with a warrant by their supplier to enter their home and fit it (the cost of this will be added to their debts). 
Commonly used as a debt management tool, 4.5mn UK households pay for their energy at point of use — and if they can’t afford it, the lights will literally go out. 
“Energy companies love prepayment customers, as they get their money straight away,” she says. The charity National Energy Action has predicted that hundreds of thousands of households will manage the bill shock by voluntarily “self disconnecting” and surviving for days with no heat, power or hot water in an attempt to balance budgets.

If people are reduced to living like this, you can see what’s feeding the grim trade in tips involving bowls of water and black bin bags.
And the squeeze has only just begun. Politicians, energy companies and charities are all crying out for more to be done — but the big question is: what?
It’s obvious that measures outlined in the Spring Statement won’t be anywhere near enough for the poorest families to get through the winter. One idea gaining traction is a deeply-discounted “social

		 for customers considered “vulnerable” or in fuel poverty that would knock £1,000 off annual bills. 
There are no easy solutions to funding this. A 10-year clawback, imposing a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, scrapping the price cap and charging middle and higher-income households much more for their power have all been suggested this week.
With bad debts rising fast, we can’t wait until October to decide. The extreme energy rationing highlighted by this Facebook group should spur those in power to get ahead of the next phase of the crisis well before temperatures start to drop.

Dear reader, 
I had two moments of abrupt and instructive disillusionment this week.
The first involved a busking violinist whose instrument was hooked up to a portable speaker. A tricky passage from Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons” was surging forth. I dug out a coin, intending to drop it in the violin case at his feet.
A gust of window blew the case shut. The violinist removed his hand from the fingerboard to reopen the case. The cadenza continued unabated.
He could thank the pre-recorded soundtrack on his smartphone for that.
My second disillusionment followed Wednesday’s 36 per cent drop in the shares of Netflix. The US streaming service warned it would lose 2mn users in the current quarter. It might still be cranking out the content. But like my fiddling friend, Netflix had proved far less of a virtuoso than patrons imagined.
The rest of this email is split into sections for ease of reading. Thanks go to readers for some smart comments under Lex notes this week. Don’t be shy if you do not post but would like to. We encourage intelligent debate by deleting any personal attacks.
If you have broader thoughts on our coverage — including suggested topics — please email me at lexfeedback@ft.com. 
Economist Hyman Minsky theorised that markets are innately unstable. They are subject to sudden falls, he said, when investors simultaneously realise valuations have overshot long-run prospects. 
The tech sector is suffering a series of stock-specific Minsky moments. The Netflix tumble was one of these. So was Meta’s 26 per cent one-day drop in February, after the Facebook owner also admitted to faltering growth.
My long-run theory has been that the battle for audiences in streaming is bound to trigger big write-offs of content spending during the inevitable shakeout. 
Netflix spent about $14bn on content in 2021. It capitalises these costs, amortising them in ways some independent accounting analysts find perplexing. Total assets rose from $19bn to $44.5bn between 2017 and 2021, according to S&P data. 
You could theorise that the drop in Netflix’s shares represents an attempt by the market to front-run inevitable asset writedowns by the company. My hunch is that rivals will have plenty of impairments too. 
Lex would still characterise Netflix as a relative winner in streaming, given its first-mover advantage, strong brand and global reach.
Spotify has a similar position in music streaming. That contrasts with French rival Deezer, which has a weak brand and market share. Investors should tune out of its proposed New York Spac float, we believe.
One salient characteristic of entrepreneurs is that people tell them “you can’t do that”, then they do it anyway. Elon Musk just operates at a greater scale than the others. 
Warning him it is difficult and pointless to buy out microblogging site Twitter will simply encourage him to push ahead. Musk’s claim to have “funding secured”, to repeat his famous phrase, needs further proof points, as Lex noted. But he has the wind behind him provided Tesla continues to hit its targets, thereby supporting the stock price of his electric vehicle business.
Musk may, of course, be bluffing. Playfulness is his defining characteristic. But if he goes ahead, this would be a remarkable deal: a $40bn-plus takeover by one person, rather than by a multinational corporation run by career managers.
You probably would not sink your own hard-won personal equity into buying a social network patronised by conspiracy theorists, journalists and PRs. But we all know people who enthusiastically buy things we may regard as worthless, from

Non-fungible tokens
A unit of information stored as a token on a blockchain, usually an ethereum blockchain. However, it is not fungible — meaning it cannot be interchanged with another token. That makes the token unique and turns its blockchain into a digital form of provenance. It can only have one owner. Some artists and sellers of collectible memorabilia have begun experimenting with selling NFTs. But owning the token only proves that someone has ownership of the “original” work, and does not necessarily include its copyright or its intellectual property rights.

With funding secured, Musk could mount a tender offer rather than seeking creeping control. The latter strategy has been nixed by the poison pill installed by Twitter last week. 
Peloton resembles Twitter because it has a brand more impressive than its business plan. It also has a far more effective takeover deterrent. This consists of super voting shares that give founders and managers 75 per cent of the votes based on an economic interest of only 12 per cent. Lex sides with activists opposed to this inequitable set-up.
Lex’s virtual Christmas party in 2021 involved a sampling of gourmet cheeses distributed to team members by courier. We have, therefore, been watching jumps in the prices of dairy products as anxiously as Aardman’s cheese-loving everyman Wallace would.
Food costs are soaring as a result of the war in Ukraine, longer-running supply problems and broader inflation. The international reference price for cheddar is up by a third since early 2021.
Theft of Parmesan cheese wheels is set to grow, we believe, due to their high value and the ease with which they can be rolled out of dairies by dead of night. 
More hearteningly for epicures, the price of caviar has been falling, despite an EU embargo on Russian imports. The decrease is thanks to an expansion of Chinese fish farming. The advent of lab-grown sturgeon eggs could further increase affordability.
Admittedly, the Parmesan-beluga price spread is a niche interest of the Lex team. The interests of consumers and investors are glaringly counterpoised for a much wider range of foods due to raging inflation.
Lex believes Nestlé is better placed to pass on higher input costs than Unilever and Danone because it has more premium products. However, all food companies will suffer if inflation proves deep-seated. I cannot recall any downturn where a significant proportion of businesses that had claimed defensive properties did not ultimately lose them.
Rising inflation means US interest rates will go up too. The dollar is soaring relative to the yen. Lex thinks the benefits will be modest for Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota. Their input costs are particularly steep and they have offshored much of their production.
We are more bullish on a project of UK engineer Rolls-Royce to create small modular reactors. These have a future thanks to renewed interest in nuclear generation as a means of providing baseload power. There are plenty of risks. But as readers pointed out, Rolls-Royce has SMR credibility because it already makes these power plants for submarines.
I usually wish you a pleasant break at the end of this newsletter. But that respite may already have started if you work a four-day week, as the Japanese government and businesses such as Hitachi advocate. 
I doubt the campaign will succeed, having observed the failure of previous attempts to persuade Japanese employees to kick back and relax more. Lex readers are also pretty diligent. But enjoy the next couple of days, however you use your time.

Good morning. If you can’t beat ’em, amend ’em. The big political action in the House of Commons today will be postponed after Boris Johnson submitted an amendment to delay the inquiry into whether he lied about rule-breaking in Downing Street. It’s intended to push back the prime minister’s moment of reckoning to when he reaches calmer waters. Some thoughts on that and the real job of a government whip are below. Get in touch at the below email address.
Inside Politics is edited by Georgina Quach. Follow Stephen on Twitter @stephenkb and please send gossip, thoughts and feedback to insidepolitics@ft.com.
Tennis divided | The organiser of the Wimbledon tennis tournament has announced it will ban players from Russia and Belarus from competing at this year’s championships, sparking concerns about discrimination. 
Gridlock | The government is prepared to “unilaterally” tear up the post-Brexit deal governing trade in Northern Ireland, Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned. 
Schools cuts | Two-thirds of British primary headteachers have said a lack of “catch-up” funding has left pupils struggling to recoup lost learning as schools grapple with the cost-of-living crisis.
No 10 takeover | Speculation among backbenchers is mounting, as summed up by former Tory minister Robert Goodwill writing to his constituents and stressing that while a leadership contest “at this stage” would be inappropriate, there is “a whole mine of talent . . . who could potentially take over at No 10”, in a letter leaked to Times Radio. 
What’s the role of a government whip? The answer: to make sure the party in power doesn’t lose votes in the House of Commons. 
Note the use of the words “doesn’t lose” as opposed to “wins”. Although the mythology of the whip’s role (generated both by the press and self-mythologising of successive whips) circles around the arm-twisting, blackmailing and promises of future promotion to get legislation passed, winning votes in parliament is only half the job. 
The other half is avoiding defeat — and being aware of what the parliamentary party will and will not put up with. It’s why the contentious proposals to overhaul England’s planning system to make it easier to build new homes were abandoned before they came to a vote. (Johnson would otherwise have faced the risk of a mutiny, particularly in the southern counties.)
And it’s why the government will seek to amend rather than vote down Labour’s motion today, which was designed to trigger “contempt” proceedings. Conservative whips privately conceded they could not deliver a majority of votes to block the motion without sparking major internal ructions. 
Instead, later today, the government’s amendment will pass, deferring the crunch decision on whether Johnson will be referred to the standards watchdog until after both the police investigation into Downing Street’s lockdown breaches and Sue Gray’s report have reached their conclusions. (Read the first part of Gray’s report here, helpfully annotated by our Whitehall editor Sebastian Payne.)
The prime minister is betting that by the time MPs have to vote on his rule-breaking again, his political position will be stronger. Therefore, it will be easier to get Tory MPs to vote against referring him to the commissioner. 
It’s certainly possible that he’s right. But I have an inkling that in a few months from now, after what will almost certainly be a rather painful set of local elections and an especially painful time for households and businesses, he will find himself wishing that he had got the referral to the commissioner over and done with. 
The fall in Netflix’s share price has implications for British politics, and not because MPs are big fans of its hit TV series Squid Game. 
First, Netflix’s share price is down because subscription growth has gone into reverse. (For a lot more on what this means, try Unhedged.) Households are doing what households always do when faced with cost-of-living pressures: they cut down on discretionary spending.
This generally spells bad news for both the economy as a whole and incumbent governments. If you are, say, a beleaguered prime minister hoping that the passage of time is going to turn round your fortunes, this is not a good sign. 
Netflix’s subscriber loss is also noteworthy because so much of the government’s big idea for the future of public service broadcasting — whether in Channel 4 or BBC — is that streaming services have changed the game. But it is far from clear if streaming will be able to wipe its own face financially — and in a sustainable way. We also can’t be certain if they will be able to provide the specific news programming with a clear regional identity that all governments across the democratic world are understandably fond of. 
There’s a lesson here in the UK government’s failed attempt to walk away from having to directly subsidise the BBC World Service. Despite its strengths, the market demand among British consumers for a world news service that boosts British soft power is apparently not that great. 
Cat Rutter Pooley has written a smart column on the takeaways from the privatisation of the Royal Mail back in 2013, which is worth reading in full, but this particular comparison is a useful one to think about:
Channel 4 faces competition from the streamers; Royal Mail from the parcel delivery groups FedEx, UPS, Deutsche Post DHL — and Amazon.
Visibly, the parcel delivery groups are providing something that looks an awful lot like the Royal Mail, for good and for ill. This works not only for consumers but also for the British state: there is always going to be something that delivers threatening letters from HMRC or test results from the NHS. 
Whatever ultimately happens to Netflix itself, it’s pretty clear that “streaming” can provide something that looks an awful lot like Channel 4 as far as the average consumer is concerned: it can provide prestige documentaries, trashy reality TV, drama and so forth. But it’s less clear that streaming can replicate all the things the British state gets out of public sector broadcasting today, be that the World Service or providing funding to regional programming here in the UK. 
All of which leads me to doubt that the government’s plans — to sell off Channel 4 before the next election and to bring the licence fee to an end by 2027 — will come to fruition as quickly as ministers like to claim.
Last night I watched the Arsenal game — a stressful game in which the forces of light eventually triumphed — while my partner watched the French presidential debate (final score TBC). 
To be honest, French politics is a bit more exciting than its British counterpart right now. Victor Mallet has written a superb piece on the campaign trail with Marine Le Pen. I am retreating into rewatching Baron Noir, a brilliant French political drama series and, still, obsessively checking our rolling opinion poll tracker.

https://www.ft.com/content/cea59de9-138c-4f6b-9f41-a8eca3de313f,Alex Barker,Netflix jettisons anti-ad principles to cope with lean times,2022-04-20,17:32:47,"As he built Netflix into the world’s biggest streaming service, one of Reed Hastings’ management mantras was for his staff to “tell the emperor when he has no clothes”.
With Netflix losing almost two-thirds of its market value since November and analysts likening its fall to the dotcom crash, Hastings on Tuesday finally heeded his own advice and admitted that his corporate strategy might be seriously underdressed. 
In the course of an hour on Tuesday, the Netflix founder and chief executive jettisoned his long-cherished principles, reorienting a media group that changed Hollywood to cope with leaner times of slow growth and spending restraint. 
Sharing passwords? In 2016, Hastings quipped “we love people sharing Netflix”. Now, he plans to crack down on the practice; Hastings estimated 100mn people have been sharing accounts.
Competition? For years he has dismissed the threat of Disney, Apple and HBO, insisting Netflix’s biggest competitors were Fortnite, YouTube and “sleep”. On Tuesday he admitted Netflix needs to “take it up a notch” because its competitors have “some very good shows and films out”.
But perhaps the clearest about-turn was on advertising. Having always defended Netflix as an advertising-free zone that allows viewers to “relax” without being “exploited”, Hastings flung open the doors to marketing money. 
Casually dropping the change of strategy during a call with analysts, Hastings announced Netflix would work on a cheaper, advertising-backed version of its service “in the next year or two”.
And spending? Netflix single-handedly created a template for streaming in which the stock market rewarded it for spending more money. The company burnt cash for years while investors applauded its fast subscriber growth and commitment to steadily churning out fresh TV shows and movies. For the first time, the company on Tuesday said it would curb its spending on content. 
“It was shocking,” summarised Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “These guys sounded like any other management team that just didn’t have the answers yet.”
The volte-face is a humbling moment for a company that while its subscriptions soared at the height of the pandemic was confident enough to begin proactively cancelling accounts for people who were not using them. 
After a historic stock market run as one of the big tech ‘FAANG’ companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) soaring to a valuation of nearly $310bn in October, it has shrunk back to $95bn. Shares in Netflix plunged more than 38 per cent on Wednesday alone. 
“We have watched a company go from growth darling to growth purgatory in an instant,” said Nathanson. 
One of the most painful decisions for Hastings may have been on advertising.
His rivals had long predicted Netflix would eventually buckle on an anti-advertising position that Jason Kilar, the former chief executive of Warner Media, recently compared to a “religion”. But few imagined it would come so soon. 
“The way you get a billion [subscribers] is not by continuing to charge a premium price that’s ad-free,” Kilar said. “[Netflix] will absolutely get to that conclusion.” 
Morgan Stanley expects that in the long term, Netflix can make “billions” from advertising, estimating that adverts generate about $3bn in revenue a year for rival service Hulu. 
But the bank’s analysts also questioned whether the option to offer cheaper subscriptions would boost revenues for the company, given that it has already convinced 75mn households in the US and Canada to pay on average $15 a month. “As it migrates customers to an ad-supported tier at a lower price point, can it generate higher overall [revenue]? This is less clear.”
Mark Read, chief executive of the WPP advertising group, said the change in strategy reflected the need to reach new customers and the clear “limits to growth of subscription-only models”. 
“History has shown that successful media companies have both subscription and advertising,” he said. “No doubt the pressure on household budgets as well as the increasing number of subscription offers has focused consumer minds.” 
The challenge for Netflix is to introduce the ad-supported tier of membership without either eating into its existing subscriber base, or devoting too much time and money into building an advertising business that it once saw as a distraction. 
After years as a market leader in video subscription services, Netflix must adjust to the role of latecomer in ad-funded streaming, learning from Disney, Discovery, Paramount and NBC. “There was never any fear that we’re in trouble,” said one former Netflix executive. “The feeling was: we are leap years ahead.” 
It now faces stiff competition from the world’s largest media and technology companies, which have found success with blockbuster television shows such as Apple’s Ted Lasso and HBO’s Succession. 
Among some investors and analysts, there is a sense that Netflix’s lavish spending should yield better programming. “If you spend $18bn on content, I would like to think that you can persuade people to join your streaming platform,” said a top-10

		in Netflix. 
But its share price crash is worrying for the entire entertainment industry, because the biggest US media groups have earmarked more than $100bn for spending on content this year alone to try to emulate Netflix’s model. 
Now, Hollywood is questioning whether Netflix executives seriously overestimated the size of the streaming market. 
Netflix has 222mn paying subscribers, and Hastings has told investors that his “total addressable market” was any household in the world with access to the internet — potentially a billion subscribers. There was plenty of room to grow, and ample space for new competitors, he insisted. 
But as its growth has ground to a halt, analysts are poking holes in these optimistic assumptions. Given questions of affordability and global access to digital payment systems, Nathanson estimates that the “real” addressable market is closer to 400mn.
Equally worrying, he questions whether Netflix has already reached full saturation in the US and Canada, where the company revealed on Tuesday that an additional 30mn people are sharing accounts on top of its existing 75mn subscribers. The number of US pay-TV subscribers during the peak of television in 2011 was about 100mn, indicating Netflix may have tapped out in its largest market. 
This is bad news for other media groups because their valuations have been benchmarked on Netflix. Shares in Warner Bros Discovery fell 5 per cent on Wednesday, while Disney was down 4 per cent and Paramount Global lost 10 per cent. 
Rich Greenfield, an analyst at Lightshed partners, noted the irony that streaming champions such as Netflix and Disney were now embracing advertising, a key pillar of old-media strategy, to revive their businesses. 
“It is scary if the only way to reinvigorate growth is offering cheaper products that worsen the consumer experience, essentially making it more like the dying linear TV experience,” he said.

		in the company. The opportunity to acquire Netflix at an attractive valuation emerged when investors reacted negatively to the recent quarter’s subscriber growth and management’s short-term guidance. 
. . . We have greatly admired Netflix both as consumers and as investors, but have never previously owned a stake in the company. Netflix is a primary beneficiary of the growth in streaming and the decline in linear TV driven by its superior customer experience, a vast and diverse amount of superb, constantly refreshed content, global improvements in bandwidth, and the proliferation and continuous improvement and convenience of devices on which one can watch. 
. . . We are pleased to add Netflix to our portfolio. Many of our best investments have emerged when other investors whose time horizons are short term, discard great companies at prices that look extraordinarily attractive when one has a long-term horizon. 
At the time it was seen by many as big but smart $1.1bn trade. But then Netflix reported the first decline in subscriptions in a decade. 
And guess what just landed from Ackman:
Dear Pershing Square Investor:
Today, we sold our investment in Netflix, which we purchased earlier this year. The loss on our investment reduced the Pershing Square Funds’ year-to-date returns by four percentage points. Reflecting this loss, as of today’s close, the Pershing Square Funds are down approximately two per cent year-to-date.
While we have a high regard for Netflix’s management and the remarkable company they have built, in light of the enormous operating leverage inherent in the company’s business model, changes in the company’s future subscriber growth can have an outsized impact on our estimate of intrinsic value. In our original analysis, we viewed this operating leverage favorably due to our long-term growth expectations for the company.
Yesterday, in response to continued disappointing customer subscriber growth, Netflix announced that it would modify its subscription-only model to be more aggressive in going after non-paying customers, and to incorporate advertising, an approach that management estimates would take “one to two years” to implement. While we believe these business model changes are sensible, it is extremely difficult to predict their impact on the company’s long-term subscriber growth, future revenues, operating margins, and capital intensity.
We require a high degree of predictability in the businesses in which we invest due to the highly concentrated nature of our portfolio. While Netflix’s business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company’s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty. Based on management’s track record, we would not be surprised to see Netflix continue to be a highly successful company and an excellent investment from its current market value. That said, we believe the dispersion of outcomes has widened to a sufficiently large extent that it is challenging for the company to meet our requirements for a core holding.
One of our learnings from past mistakes is to act promptly when we discover new information about an investment that is inconsistent with our original thesis. That is why we did so here.
By our back-of-the-envelope calculations, that’s a nearly $400m loss in a matter of weeks. Shoulda held on to that

		in Netflix — and pledged to focus on the “long-term horizon”.
The move by Ackman capped a painful 24 hours for Netflix, which lost close to 40 per cent of its market value, a decline of almost $60bn, after it revealed that its once-blistering subscriber growth had gone into reverse. 
The New York billionaire investor bought 3.1mn shares in Netflix over the course of a few days in late January at roughly $360 per share. At the time, he said many of Pershing Square’s best investments had “emerged when other investors, whose time horizons are short term, discard great companies”. Netflix closed at $226.19 a share on Wednesday. 
But in a letter to investors, Ackman said Pershing Square had “lost confidence in our ability to predict the company’s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty”. He cited planned changes to Netflix’s business model such as launching an advertising-supported service and clamping down on account sharing. 
Pershing Square declined to comment.
Ackman said the loss on the Netflix investment had translated to a 4 percentage point fall in returns for the Pershing Square Funds this year, leaving the funds down about 2 per cent overall over the same period.
Netflix has lost two-thirds of its market value in the past six months, falling from a peak of almost $310bn in October to $100bn on Wednesday. 
Recommended
The company has been contending with saturation in some of its markets as well as stiff competition from the likes of Disney, Apple and Warner Media, which have spent billions of dollars to break into the streaming market that Netflix pioneered. 
Ackman’s U-turn on Netflix also came weeks after he said he would abandon the aggressive activist campaigns that were a hallmark of his investment career in favour of a more “cordial, constructive” approach. 
In his letter announcing the Netflix share sale on Wednesday, he wrote: “Based on management’s track record, we would not be surprised to see Netflix continue to be a highly successful company and an excellent investment from its current market value.”

https://www.ft.com/content/70a28358-8720-4f36-a5b4-24dc0f3be9a3,Christopher Grimes,Netflix sheds subscribers for the first time in a decade,2022-04-20,12:09:56,"Netflix said its decade-long run of subscriber growth ended in the first quarter and admitted it was becoming “harder to grow membership” in many markets, sending its shares down nearly 40 per cent on Wednesday. 
The video streaming pioneer shocked investors by forecasting that its number of subscribers would fall by another 2mn in the current quarter, to about 219.6mn, after declining about 200,000 in the first quarter. Investors had expected an increase of 2.6mn subscribers. 
Netflix blamed the dramatic slowdown in part on saturation in its biggest markets. But it also acknowledged the impact of rising competition from streaming services launched by traditional media groups such as Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount. Together, these factors had created “revenue growth headwinds”, the company said. 
“We’re definitely feeling higher levels of [market] penetration . . . and heightened competition,” said Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive.
The report from Netflix, published after the market close on Tuesday, marked a reversal in fortune for a company that has shown blistering growth over the past 10 years, and which boomed during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. As it showed signs of slowing late last year, company officials blamed “noise” from the lingering effects of the Covid crisis.
“This was a change in tone”, said Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who noted Netflix rarely even acknowledged that it faced competition in the past. “It sounds like they’re in rebuilding mode.”
Netflix said it would try to jump-start growth by improving the “quality of our programming” and by seeking to charge some of the 100mn households that share other users’ accounts. 
Reed Hastings, co-chief executive, said account sharing, which has always been a problem at Netflix, is coming into focus. “When we were growing fast it was not a high priority, but now we’re working super hard on it,” Hastings said. The company is testing how to charge for shared accounts in markets such as Chile and Peru. 
Hastings also said Netflix planned to launch an ad-supported streaming service — an idea that he had long resisted. “It’s something we’re looking at now and will roll out over next year or two,” he said. “It’s working for Hulu, and Disney is doing it. Those companies have figured it out.”
The report will probably intensify investor concerns about the cost of the streaming wars, and the potential size of the profits at stake. Netflix will spend $19.2bn on content this year, Uerkwitz estimated, as it competes with Amazon, Apple, Disney and others that are investing heavily in streaming. 
Recommended
Spencer Neumann, Netflix chief financial officer, said the company will be “pulling back on some of our spending growth across both content and non-content” over the next 18 to 24 months because of slower revenue growth. “But we will still be investing aggressively into that long-term opportunity.” 
Netflix raised prices in the US and Canada, which cost it about 600,000 subscribers but was nevertheless “significantly revenue positive”, the company said. It also quit streaming in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, costing it about 700,000 subscribers.
This is the second time Netflix has surprised investors this year, after jolting the markets in January with its forecast that subscriber growth would slow significantly in 2022. Its shares are down about 40 per cent this year.

The world’s largest streaming service said late on Tuesday that its decade-long run of subscriber growth, which had powered its share price, had come to an end in the first quarter of 2022. The company expects to shed 2mn subscribers in the current quarter, having lost about 200,000 in the previous three months. 
Market saturation, especially in the US and Canada, signalled that it had become “harder to grow membership” in some regions, the company said. 
“We have witnessed a company go from a growth darling to growth purgatory in an instant,” Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note. 
The news reverberated across the media industry, hitting shares in traditional groups such as Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery that have spent billions in an effort to emulate Netflix’s streaming model. Together, video streaming companies are expected to spend in excess of $100bn this year on content to attract subscribers to their services. 
Netflix acknowledged competitors were eating into its audience, and vowed to improve the quality of its programming. Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, said the company’s content “is simply not resonating relative to the level of spend”, which he put at about $17bn a year. 
“Netflix should be creating significantly more must-see TV series and movies that become ongoing franchises,” he said. 
The company also pledged to crack down on the estimated 100mn households that share other users’ accounts. “It feels like something Netflix should have done anyway and years ago,” said one top-10

		in the company. “Not just because they missed their quarterly numbers.”
Reed Hastings, co-chief executive, said the company was working “super hard” on the crack down. 
Hastings also surprised investors by announcing plans to launch an advertising-supported version of Netflix — a step he had long resisted. But that move, which analysts generally welcomed, is expected to take “a year or two”, he said. 
The top-10 Netflix shareholder said an ad-supported streaming service had the potential to cannibalise the company’s existing business “but it could also allow Netflix to grow a new cohort of subscribers”.
Walt Disney, owner of the Disney Plus streaming service, fell as much as 5.8 per cent by lunchtime in New York, while streaming platform and hardware business Roku dropped as much as 9.8 per cent. Music streaming service Spotify slid almost 10 per cent.
Streaming services and other companies that prospered in the pandemic had “lost a lot of value during the past few months”, said Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi Group. “The market was expecting this but nobody expected the [Netflix] subscriber losses to be as dramatic as they were.”

There was a surprising yet familiar sight when the mail arrived one day this week at an old neighbour’s house where I’m staying, on a return to the Bay Area.
Among all the flyers and junk mail was a slim red envelope that took me back nearly 20 years. It was a Netflix DVD delivery.
While streaming has succeeded spinning a disc to get your entertainment, the DVD service still exists for people like my friend. He prefers to consume media at a slower pace, get those director’s commentary add-ons and discover the many movies still not available online.
Having physical media delivered is also a way of making you more aware of your subscriptions and their value to you. We reported this week that UK households cancelled video subscriptions in record numbers in the first quarter, as they were forced to take stock of their spending. 
Consumers walked away from about 1.5mn video on-demand accounts as they curbed non-essentials to cope with the cost of living squeeze, reinforcing concerns that the pandemic-fuelled boom in streaming is over. 
Netflix’s earnings last night confirmed the trend. The company said its decade-long run of subscriber growth ended in the first quarter with a decline of around 200,000 users, and a further 2mn expected to be lost in the current quarter. 
The news has sent its shares down 35 per cent today and, as Lex points out, since its peak late last year, Netflix’s stock has crashed more than 60 per cent, reflecting a loss of around $200bn in equity value.
The company explained its biggest markets had reached saturation point and there was rising competition for subscribers from the likes of Apple and Disney’s streaming services.
It aims to shore up the business with higher subscription fees and the development of a lower-priced ad-supported service. It will also put the squeeze on shared accounts — it estimates that at least 100mn users are watching Netflix through shared passwords.
That doesn’t affect me watching a DVD movie with my old neighbour, but all those family and friends sharing out there are on notice that the era of binge-watching online for free is coming to an end.
1. Meta suffers Brazilian setbackMeta’s long-awaited plan to allow users to send money to businesses via WhatsApp in Brazil — what would have been a world-first for the encrypted messaging app — has been hit by clashes with potential payments partners. It’s the latest blow to the tech giant’s sprawling ecommerce ambitions and push into financial services.
2. Meta and Google restrict LeeIn accordance with US sanctions, Google and Meta have restricted the social media presence of former Hong Kong security chief John Lee, who is running uncontested with Beijing’s backing for city leader next month. YouTube suspended Lee’s campaign channel, while Facebook and Instagram have banned payment services for the former bureaucrat.
3. JET looks to offload GrubhubJust Eat Takeaway is exploring a sale of Grubhub, ceding to months of investor pressure over a deal it struck at the height of the pandemic lockdown-driven food delivery boom. The entire JET group’s market capitalisation of $6.3bn is now lower than the $7.3bn it paid just for Chicago-based Grubhub. Helen Thomas says the acquisition always looked unappetising.
4. Musk struggles to attract PE interest in TwitterElon Musk’s $43bn bid to take Twitter private is struggling to draw interest from several large institutions with the financial firepower to pull off such a large leveraged buyout, in part owing to concerns over whether the social media group can become more profitable. Our Moral Money newsletter says Twitter shareholders should consider the social impact of a Musk takeover.

Netflix’s decade-long run of subscriber growth ended in the first quarter and the streaming pioneer admitted worse was to come in the current quarter, triggering a share price drop.
The company said subscriber numbers dropped by about 200,000 between January and March, and shocked investors by predicting that number would balloon in the current quarter to about 2mn. 
Netflix blamed the dramatic slowdown in part on saturation in its biggest markets. It also acknowledged the impact of competition from streaming services launched by traditional media groups such as Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount. 
Price rises in the US and Canada cost the company about 600,000 subscribers although it said the strategy had been “significantly revenue positive”. It also quit streaming in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, costing it about 700,000 subscribers.
Netflix said it would try to address the slowing growth by improving the “quality of our programming” and by seeking to charge some of the 100mn households that share other users’ accounts.
It also planned to launch an ad-supported streaming service — an idea that he had long resisted, co-chief executive Reed Hastings said.
Netflix shares fell by a quarter in after-market trading, suggesting as much as $40bn could be wiped off the company’s valuation when the stock market opens later today. The falls are helping to drag down Nasdaq 100 futures contracts and the

“This was a change in tone”, said Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz who studies the company.

It was not necessarily a surprise. In recent years Netflix’s reputation in Hollywood has somehow swung between “cash-machine handing out cheques for pretty much anything” to “ruthless algorithm that cancels shows at whim”. There has been outrage over beloved shows such as Tuca & Bertie abruptly ending, seemingly with no explanation. 
The most recent victim was The Babysitters Club, a TV series based on some 1990s books about pre-teen girls navigating their adolescence in suburban Connecticut. The show, which debuted on Netflix last year, seemed to hit all the right notes: 1990s nostalgia, a talented young cast, and uplifting stories centred on female friendship. It was one of the best-reviewed shows ever on Netflix. 
The show’s creator, who had worked with Netflix for several years, is publicly baffled by the decision to end it after two seasons. “I don’t know what they wanted that they didn’t get . . . Our numbers seemed fine . . . It was pretty close to what we did last season,’‘ Rachel Shukert told the Vulture site. “I feel like Netflix’s internal metrics can change month to month. Something that was fine three months ago is suddenly not what they need.” 
Shukert has a lot of guesses why Netflix killed her show, such as the “bad luck” of coming out around the same time as Squid Game; or that the children watching her show would not be allowed to binge TV for hours; or the fact that Netflix’s subscriber growth has ground to a halt in the US and the company is looking for international expansion.
A person close to the situation told me that Netflix makes renewal decisions based on viewership versus cost, and because The Babysitters Club was produced by an outside studio rather than Netflix, it was relatively more expensive. 
Data also disprove Shukert’s theory that Netflix is less interested in renewing US shows. In 2021, Netflix released 184 US television seasons and cancelled 20 of them, while releasing 149 non-US seasons and cancelling 21 of those. 
Yet the fact that Shukert has no idea why her own show died speaks to a criticism of Netflix, and streaming more broadly. In the past, there were clear measures for success in entertainment. A movie sold a certain number of tickets at cinemas. A television show was watched by a precise number of people, as measured by Nielsen. If something was a hit or flop, everyone knew. 
Streaming has removed these yardsticks. Netflix has begun releasing some viewership numbers, but it is limited to what was most popular. Netflix does not sell advertisements, and has no financial incentive to release its trove of data. So the only way we find out what “failed”, in Netflix’s view, is by what gets cancelled. 
Netflix does drop more shows than other studios. It cancelled 11 per cent of its US television series last year, while Disney and WarnerMedia dropped 9 per cent, NBCUniversal 8 per cent and ViacomCBS only 4 per cent, according to Ampere. 
Perhaps the best insight into Netflix’s strategy was in a letter to a UK House of Lords committee. The company said it focused on “completers” — people who watch all of a show in the first 28 days after it is released — which would probably put quieter, slow-burning shows at a disadvantage. Or put simply: Netflix rewards bingeing. 
While Hulu and HBO Max have been releasing episodes staggered over time, Netflix has stuck to its all at once, binge-drop strategy. Most Netflix shows end after two or three seasons, and the company’s priority is adding and retaining subscribers — not selling advertising. A new show is probably a better way to find new subscribers than one that has already been around. 
All this breeds an ephemeral nature to the platform. A Netflix show can be popular for a few days or a week, and then is quickly supplanted by the next release. These details might seem trivial on an individual level, but with hundreds of shows a year, Netflix has become the largest commissioner of television in the world. It is the Godzilla of the business it once disrupted. This is why people like Shukert — and Hollywood at large — agonise over figuring out what Netflix wants. 
There has been a long-simmering frustration that Netflix is an opaque conveyor belt of content. I am told that a few more painful cancellations are coming soon. Did not enough people binge them?

The Oscars’ snubbing of Netflix’s latest attempt to become the first streaming service to win Best Picture will smart all the more after Apple swiped the award, writes Tim Bradshaw. 
Netflix’s Power of the Dog had been the favourite to win a historic Best Picture Oscar until just last week when Apple’s CODA — a film about the musical ambitions of a child of deaf adults — appeared to come from nowhere to lead the pack.
As the FT’s man in LA, Chris Grimes, put it in his story last night: “The win by Apple, the world’s most valuable company, will be seen as deeply symbolic in Hollywood.”
Apple bought CODA at the Sundance film festival for a reported $25mn. By some estimates, it spent almost as much again marketing the movie during this year’s awards season, according to Matthew Belloni at Puck, who noted in his prescient Oscar preview: “Netflix and Amazon, after more than a decade of original content, and five years of aggressively throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at lavish campaigns, will have been outplayed by their richer tech rival.”
CODA took home three Academy Awards in total, including Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay, capping earlier wins at the SAG, PGA, Bafta, Critics Choice and Film Independent Spirit awards.
The Hollywood Reporter’s Abbey White marvelled at just how fast Apple captured the industry’s highest accolade: “I don’t think that I or anyone else could have imagined, when I sat in the audience at Apple’s Cupertino headquarters for the unveiling of Apple’s original content plans on March 25, 2019, that Apple would have a best picture Oscar winner in just three years.”
Apple says that its TV series and films have now notched up 240 wins and 953 nominations, including several for its football comedy Ted Lasso.For all those awards, it is unclear just how many iPhones — which Oprah Winfrey memorably noted at that 2019 launch event are in “a billion pockets, y’all” — have tuned in to CODA or Ted Lasso. Apple has not released subscriber figures for TV+.But this isn’t just about eyeballs: there could hardly be a more on-brand movie for Apple than this feel-good family drama with an inclusive message.Apple’s only disappointment must be that its moment of glory was overshadowed by a rather less wholesome incident between Will Smith and Chris Rock.

		 and Cevian Capital, a top-5 shareholder in Ericsson, said they would both reject a discharge. The Swedish telecoms equipment maker’s handling of possible payments to the Isis terror group has wiped a third off its share price.
3. Ethical hackers cash inHackers who help to highlight vulnerabilities in Big Tech by reporting them to companies such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook have been receiving so-called bug bounties — or rewards — of hundreds of thousands of pounds. The sector is becoming more professional with platforms offering connections to ethical hackers as part of its services, as well as certification and training.

Even by the overwrought standards of this spectacular sport, last year’s season was, as they say, next level.
The contest in Abu Dhabi, which concluded the 2021 season in December, was set up to be a thriller: the two leading contenders, Mercedes’s Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, equal on points, the former seeking a record-breaking eighth championship, the young pretender looking for his first. The clear winner, says F1 president and CEO Stefano Domenicali, smiling to the cameras before the race, “will be Formula 1” . He was both right — and wrong.
The race’s climax became a bizarre one-lap shootout that handed the trophy to Verstappen and kept the world talking for weeks. Few observers, however, found the conclusion obviously fair, appropriate or even understandable. Formula 1’s finest moment threatened to become its most ignoble, as lawyers dived into the controversy.
Some of the exchanges around the race have already become part of F1 history, and it is satisfying to see them played out in something approaching real time here. “What just happened?” demands bewildered Mercedes boss Toto Wolff of race director Michael Masi. “It’s called a motor race, OK?” replies Masi bluntly.
Despite appeals, the result stood. In an earlier episode, Masi describes his role as that of “race director, safety delegate, friend and umpire”, which seems about three jobs too many — and so it proved. He has since been removed from his position as part of a restructuring exercise. 
Widespread among the criticisms of Netflix’s series, which is, make no mistake, assembled and edited with rare brilliance, is that it has itself had an undue influence on events on the track. The final moments of Abu Dhabi, according to those critics, were the contrived result of the pressure for unnecessarily heightened drama. In the race’s aftermath, even the British driver Lando Norris conceded that the finish had been “for the TV, of course” .
Recommended
The show’s producers have rightly ridiculed the thought that Masi might have been influenced, in those tense seconds, by the presence of the Netflix cameras. But reality TV has taught us that these interplays work more insidiously than that. One of Drive to Survive’s strengths has been to delve more closely into the characters of a sport whose aficionados can happily talk for two consecutive hours on tyre treads. There can be little doubt that it has substantially broadened F1’s appeal.
Those characters, in turn, are beginning to understand the show’s requirements, and have learnt to play to the gallery. The result is often cartoon-like: Wolff is portrayed as (or portrays himself as) urbane, reflective, mindful of the sport’s decorum; Red Bull principal Christian Horner is the disrupter, sharper in tone, and endlessly aggressive: “We’ll get the fuckers,” he says, on more than one occasion, of his determination to end Mercedes’s dominance. Wolff says it is like being snapped at by a Jack Russell terrier.
As for the true protagonists, Verstappen and Hamilton, remarkable drivers both, they understand the need to tread lightly on the throttle of this particular juggernaut. The Dutchman sees no need to talk directly to the Netflix cameras at all; Hamilton’s self-possession is a beautifully played exercise in showbiz Zen. Asked about his motivation, he movingly recalls his schooldays, when, as the only black boy in the playground, he was always last to be picked for football teams. It is a rare insight.
In the final scene of the final episode, Wolff, dressed in a funereally-dark polo neck, is asked if there is now a target on the back of the Red Bull drivers. His response is the kind of thing Aeschylus might have teased the audience with after the first part of the Oresteian trilogy. “Everybody has a target on their backs next year.” Long pause, fade to black.

What algorithmic witchcraft decided the scheduling — with male and female target audiences neatly divided between the two — we can only guess. Instead, we are left with the question posed by smooth-surfaced Netflix sci-fi The Adam Project. What would become of a schoolboy who talked to his peers like Ryan Reynolds?
The actor is the star, once more deploying his trademark persona as deadpan motormouth. But that delivery now comes in stereo, matched by a 12-year-old version of his character, Adam Reed, played by Walker Scobell. The two meet thanks to time-travel and high-concept scriptwriting. Young Adam is growing up in 2022, to which Reynolds returns as his older self, a wisecracking action man from a future dystopia. 
Director Shawn Levy last worked with Reynolds on the gaming-literate comedy Free Guy. Here, though, nostalgia for the pre-digital 1980s hangs heavy, worked into a slick paste of industrial wholesomeness. A key ingredient is Back to the Future, the older Adam colliding not just with his childhood self but his recently widowed mother (Jennifer Garner). The Oedipal stress endured by Michael J Fox is not repeated, but the story does demand he become his own surrogate father figure, until a further bump back in time reunites both Adams with their quantum physicist dad (played with faultless professionalism by Mark Ruffalo).
If it weren’t already obvious, it certainly becomes so now that the science is just a pretext for a misty-eyed hokum of father-son-son bonding. The typical 12-year-old boy ordered to stop watching Twitch streamers and check out this ode to classic vinyl and catcher’s mitts might leave feeling sceptical of both film and family. He may also need reminding that women have long been part of the workforce, despite the movie’s deep misgivings.
★★☆☆☆
Nostalgia also takes a leading role in the chipper Pixar animation Turning Red. Here the past is more modish, the story set in 2002. If older viewers might ask what is so special about the 2000s, the younger end of Generation Z will simply howl delightedly at the flip-phones and Tamagotchis.
The story is cross-cultural, 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian heroine Mei Lee (Rosalie Chiang) navigating double lives in Toronto. The school day is a riot of boy bands and tight-knit friendships; at home she pays nervy deference to first-generation immigrant parents. The whole movie is two things at once. Pre-adolescent girls will surely greet the everyday embarrassments heaped on Mei by her mother (voiced by Sandra Oh) like a real-life horror film. The result, however, is the stuff of fable: transformation into a red panda of giant scale and destructive rages, a fluffy Hulk, a cuddlesome Hyde. And yes, director Domee Shi has said, any metaphors suggested by the title are deliberate.
Of course, the olds — myself included — miss the Pixar that once revolutionised animation. The company has now seemingly settled into an undemanding mid-life of endless sequels and modest, brightly coloured coming-of-ages. But amid the melancholy is also the sense that the visionary likes of Wall-E were loved more by cinephiles than by actual children, who may be better served by the kind of gently upbeat tale of self-acceptance Turning Red embodies. Like the realistic fur that once tormented computer animators, such things are harder than they look.

Hurt, he takes aim at the unenlightened critics: “Don’t they know what the job is? To say what something means.”
So, without further delay, what is the meaning of this new six-part limited series, developed by prolific producer Ryan Murphy (American Crime Story)? Well, that scene in which we hear Warhol pour scorn on his detractors perhaps contains the answer. This show uses his diary to disentangle the public performance of “Andy Warhol” — a persona that curator Jeffrey Deitch declares to be the artist’s “greatest work” — from the man’s private life, which was plagued by the kind of insecurity and anxiety we find in his response to a negative review. 
The value of the so-called “diary” (in fact, an edited transcription of phone calls from 1976-1987 between Warhol and his friend Pat Hackett) is not that it offers concrete art-historical insight. Rather, it provides a revealing self-portrait of an individual riven by contradictions and at the mercy of his own mood.
The quotidian extracts presented are often the most interesting. Hearing Warhol describe how a dinner aggravated his gallbladder injury (sustained in the 1968 attempted assassination from which he never fully recovered), or how a kids’ film penetrated through his emotional barricades, is far more compelling than the familiar aphorism about how “making money is art”. Occasionally his nihilistic laments can come across as self-pitying, but mostly he’s devastatingly self-aware. And behind every wry observation or enthusiastic reminiscence of a night out is a pervasive melancholy.
Recommended
What sets The Andy Warhol Diaries apart from the book, published in 1989, is that here his words are brought to life by an AI voice replicator. Given that Warhol once famously claimed he would like to be a machine, it seems like a fitting rather than exploitative use of the technology. But the show doesn’t do exactly what it says on the tin, Campbell’s soup or otherwise. While it is built around diary entries, the series is driven by an exhaustive array of interviews — an eclectic crowd of art-world insiders (Larry Gagosian, Lucy Sante), cultural outsiders (John Waters) and celebrities (Rob Lowe, Jerry Hall) — and their frequently fascinating, sometimes overly self-involved, recollections of Warhol. Between those who knew him, and Warhol’s own self-scrutiny, it’s easy to refute the artist’s assessment that: “There’s not very much to say about me”.

The California-based streaming service will pay €65mn in cash for Next Games, which alongside Stranger Things has also created adaptations of The Walking Dead television show. 
The offer follows Microsoft’s planned $75bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard and comes as Big Tech companies Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta and Apple all step up their investment in video games, driving accelerating consolidation across the industry. 
The deal is Netflix’s largest in gaming since announcing its expansion into interactive entertainment last July. Netflix has said it plans to bundle games into its existing TV and film subscription service. It acquired its first games developer, Night School Studio, in September. 
The two deals point to Netflix’s strategy of releasing games with narrative ties to its existing content portfolio. Next Games also gives Netflix a foothold in one of the most successful countries for mobile games development, making it a neighbour of Clash of Clans maker Supercell and Angry Birds creator Rovio. 
Netflix will pay €2.10 a share for Next Games, more than double the company’s closing price on Tuesday.

		 and AMC Networks, the US media group that partnered with the developer on its Walking Dead games, have both said they back the deal, representing about 43 per cent of the shares. 
Shares in Next Games lost more than a quarter of their value over the course of two weeks last December after it said it would not be able to hit the revenue targets it had set at the beginning of 2021. On Wednesday, it reported annual results for the second half of 2021 that showed revenues grew 1 per cent to €12.9mn. Pre-tax losses for the full year widened 37 per cent to €5.6mn. 
The deal comes as Netflix prepares to release the fourth season of Stranger Things, the 1980s horror drama that is one of its most popular homegrown franchises, in May. 
After going public at €7.90 a share in 2017, Next Games saw its shares lose more than three-quarters of their value during 2018. While it benefited from the boom in gaming during the first wave of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns in 2020, its shares had fallen almost two-thirds in the past 12 months, until news of Netflix’s bid saw them almost double on Wednesday. 
Mike Verdu, the former Facebook and Electronic Arts executive who is now Netflix’s vice-president of games, said Next Games had “a seasoned management team, strong track record with mobile games based on entertainment franchises, and solid operational capabilities”. 
“We are excited for Next Games to join Netflix as a core studio in a strategic region and key talent market, expanding our internal game studio capabilities,” he said. “Next Games will help us build a world-class portfolio of games that our members around the world can enjoy.”
Petri Niemi, chair of the board at Next Games, added: “The speed of consolidation in the games and entertainment industry is accelerating and the board of directors see a clear benefit for Next Games in joining forces with one of the largest entertainment companies in the world.”

Yet more than five years later, Netflix’s ambitions to find 100mn subscribers from India look like hubris.
Today, Netflix has just 5.5mn subscribers in India, according to Media Partners Asia (MPA), a research and consulting company. In contrast, MPA estimates that Netflix’s competitors, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus Hotstar, have 16mn and 50mn, respectively — the latter boosted by holding the rights to air Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches. 
Netflix does not disclose subscriber numbers by country but dissatisfaction about its progress in India was clear during an earnings call last month. In “every single other major market, we’ve got the flywheel spinning,” said Reed Hastings, chief executive. “The thing that frustrates us is why haven’t we been as successful in India.”

		crucial to its overall growth strategy. In recent quarters, the California-based group’s once-stellar subscriber growth has flatlined in the US, its largest market, where it has been fending off new competition. Netflix shares have dropped about 37 per cent since the beginning of the year.
To keep subscriber numbers climbing, Netflix expanded aggressively into Europe, Latin America and Asia, investing heavily in local-language programming. In India, it spent $400mn between 2019 and 2020 on local productions. 
“We’re quite bullish that India isn’t fundamentally different in some way,” said Greg Peters, Netflix’s chief operating officer.
Yet analysts point out that Netflix was slow to address various India-specific issues, from pricing and distribution, to the importance of commissioning more shows in regional languages such as Tamil. 
According to one industry veteran, Netflix’s approach “was more like, ‘I have built the plumbing for the whole world, I just need to turn on the tap in India,’ instead of having an India strategy”.
Crucially, Netflix has not identified its target audience in India, according to three Indian entertainment professionals who currently or previously worked with the company. “If Netflix says my next 100mn subscribers are going to come from India [population 1.4bn], you need to know which 100mn,” said the studio executive, who asked not to be named so as not to undermine working relationships.
Netflix said: “We are proud of what we have achieved in India . . . Our goal ultimately is to offer a wide variety of high-quality shows and films that would bring joy to entertainment fans around the world.”
Although India’s massive Hindi and regional language entertainment industry churns out hit after hit, original content has not won Netflix significant viewer numbers in the country. 
The latest data from RedSeer, a research provider, showed that in January just 4 to 6 per cent of streamer-made programming watched in India originated from Netflix. Disney Plus Hotstar bagged 45 to 47 per cent of that category.
Yet Netflix has had some big original wins. It says, without providing details, that it scored high viewing numbers for violent thriller Sacred Games, earned critical acclaim for the dystopian drama Leila and bagged an Emmy award for Delhi Crime. 
Its most watched Hindi film was Haseen Dillruba, a romance thriller. In September, Hastings said Netflix had completed 70 Indian originals, and had 90 more in the pipeline.
“We are also investing in more diverse stories from all corners of the country, to bring joy to members who speak different languages,” Netflix said.
But edgy offerings have yet to generate a Money Heist style long-running hit series in India — Sacred Games did not run past series two — and data analysis by Omdia indicates that foreign shows have topped Netflix India’s viewing charts for the past two quarters. Netflix has now shelved plans to open its first fully-owned post-production facility in Mumbai.
In contrast, industry observers said Amazon had been faster to push into regional languages and offered more content, while Disney Plus Hotstar had catered more successfully to a mass-market audience because of its rights to the IPL, as well as soap operas. 
While Bollywood welcomed Netflix’s money, one pre-production creative complained about the company’s excessive “meddling in the creative process”, adding that the result was, at times, “formulaic”. Another executive complained that Netflix had required that their studio assign a showrunner and two directors to one show — an American style of production. 
“What was happening below the surface was all the high-quality talent . . . were staying away,” said one industry veteran, who works with one of Netflix’s streaming competitors.
Meanwhile, in a country where customers enjoy some of the world’s cheapest data, Netflix’s pricing was high and distribution partnerships limited, said Mihir Shah, MPA vice-president. 
Compared with Amazon and Disney Plus Hotstar, “for a market that’s so value conscious, [Netflix is] . . . at an expensive price point,” said Shah. “If your cost of data is around $2-$2.50, and you layer [a streaming] service which has a price point of say around $5 to $7, it just doesn’t match.”
Netflix is changing course and in December slashed monthly subscription prices in India, in some cases by as much as 60 per cent. The cheapest plan, for mobile only, now costs Rs149 ($1.99) a month, while its most premium option is Rs649. Yet this is still well above rival Disney Plus Hotstar, which charges only Rs49 for its mobile app, or Rs299 for its premium plan.
“Our recently announced pricing plans have made our service more accessible for consumers in India,” Netflix said. 
Recommended
Shah said the reduction would allow Netflix to “go and have a deeper partnership with telcos” — a strategy that has worked for Amazon and Disney, that have long been available as part of data or pay-TV bundles.
Jio, India’s largest mobile telecoms provider, is now offering Netflix as part of postpaid mobile data bundles, alongside Amazon and Disney. In television, Tata Play, previously Tata Sky, recently announced that it had added Netflix to “Binge” deals. 
Of the big US media companies, Disney has found the most success in India. However, its supremacy may be threatened if it is outbid for the media rights to the IPL in the coming weeks. A media venture majority owned by India’s biggest listed company, Reliance Industries, is expected to bid, as are Amazon and Sony-Zee. 
Despite Netflix’s frustrations in India, Bollywood hopes it will stay and spend. 
“Netflix may not have the numbers of a Hotstar yet,” said a showrunner who is currently working with Netflix and said it had been a positive experience. “But unless you’re maybe half a dozen people who can pick and choose . . . 99.9 per cent of people in the industry would love to work with Netflix.”

https://www.ft.com/content/d1c90aaa-f437-42fc-8f63-617aafcff44b,Laura Pitel,Netflix strikes an uneasy compromise in Erdogan’s Turkey,2022-02-23,16:06:43,"On one level, the Turkish Netflix series The Club is a classic family drama, exploring thorny relationships between mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and themes of revenge and regret. But it has a more complex, second layer that runs beneath the nostalgic depictions of 1950s Istanbul with its sharp tailoring, vintage cars and music hall stars.
The heroine, who is based on the grandmother of one of the show’s writers, is a Jewish former convict called Matilda, whose family was decimated by a 1942 wealth tax that targeted the country’s non-Muslims. 
A second series, released last month, depicts another seminal moment for Turkey’s minorities: a 1955 pogrom that primarily targeted Istanbul’s Greek community but also engulfed Armenians and Jews. We watch Matilda search frantically for her daughter, Rasel, as nationalist mobs rampage along Independence Avenue, looting and beating.
It is hard for those outside Turkey to understand how radical it is to depict these events, which devastated some of the country’s minority communities and remain deeply taboo. “I was amazed,” says Ivo Molinas, the editor-in-chief of the Turkish Jewish newspaper Salom. “We never thought that this kind of series, from the perspective of non-Muslims, could be shown in Turkey.”
Turkey is a complicated operating environment for Netflix, like some of the other emerging markets the US streaming giant has sought to conquer. A country of 85mn, where the average age is 33, it is an important growth market as well as a key creative hub. But Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s increasingly heavy-handed efforts to police the cultural sphere have at times made life difficult. 
The Turkish president, who has described Netflix as an “immoral” outlet that “does not suit” his nation, has imposed stringent new requirements on foreign social media and streaming services. They now face frequent meddling in their output.
In 2020, Netflix decided to cancel a Turkish drama called If Only after authorities said that they would only grant permission to film if it removed a gay character. It blocked access to an episode of its American political thriller Designated Survivor after officials in Ankara objected to the portrayal of a fictitious Turkish president as a villain. Last December, it was forced to take down a Spanish film called More the Merrier after the broadcast watchdog said that its depictions of incest and swinging were at odds with “Turkish family values”.
Yet though it has at times bowed to censorship, Netflix has also pushed boundaries with shows like The Club. Another original series, Fatma, told the story of a cleaner who went on a killing rampage against men in response to years of misogyny and trauma. A show called Ethos sparked a debate about the country’s deep political polarisation. Turkish critic Kenan Behzat Sharpe said it was as if the show “put us all in the therapist’s office and asked us to speak”.
It is striking, however, that no openly gay character has appeared in a Turkish Netflix original since the debacle over If Only two years ago. Any show that explicitly satirised or mocked the current government would presumably also be a no-go. 
Company executives insist they are not engaging in self-censorship. Pelin Distas, Netflix’s director of original content for Turkey, says she and her team would give the green light to any script that contained “authentic vision or a great story”. She says Netflix never tells its writers what to do: “We strongly believe in creative freedom and artistic expression.”
Since obtaining a local licence, Netflix no longer has to submit scripts for approval to film in Turkey. But the streaming service must comply with local law — including takedown requests from the government. As a result, it seems willing to accept an uneasy compromise, pushing some boundaries but respecting others, in order to retain a foothold.
“In an ideal world, they wouldn’t be bowing down, says Bilge Yesil, an associate professor of media culture at the City University of New York. “But it’s not an ideal world.” For all the virtues of series such as The Club, Yesil adds, “Netflix is not producing these shows to unearth the unspoken ugly truths about Turkish history . . . what drives Netflix is obviously profit.”

These words stem from the wonderfully warped mind of Seinfeld’s George Costanza, but the phrase could just as easily have been the credo of a real New York master of mendacity: Anna Sorokin. 
Perhaps “real” isn’t the best word when discussing Sorokin, also known as Anna Delvey. In 2019, the 20-something Russian — who had convinced Manhattan’s high society that she was a German heiress worth around $60mn — was found guilty of eight charges, including grand larceny in the second degree, having defrauded banks, hotels, and members of the glitterati of thousands. She pleaded not guilty, claiming she had done nothing wrong and manipulated no one. Details about her true identity remain sketchy, but it’s likely that “contrition” isn’t her middle name. 
The story quickly transcended the exclusive circle in which it played out. Extensive media coverage was followed by a book, a podcast, a documentary and now a new nine-part Netflix dramatisation, Inventing Anna, created by Bridgerton showrunner Shonda Rhimes, and based on a 2018 long-read.
We begin with an opening narration, delivered — in an approximation of Sorokin’s peculiarly-cadenced, vaguely eastern European accent — by lead actress Julia Garner (Ozark). “This whole story is about me . . . you know me . . . everyone knows me,” she says. But of course, nobody actually knew her. An amusing montage in the first episode sees her closest confidants provide entirely contradictory impressions of all facets of Sorokin’s life to the journalist investigating the case. 
She is Vivian Kent (Veep’s Anna Chlumsky), a reporter at the fictional Manhattan magazine who inveigles an initially reluctant Sorokin to offer an exclusive by promising to make her an icon. From then on the series tracks Kent’s efforts to uncover concrete information about her elusive subject.
Interspersed throughout are flashbacks that reveal and revel in Sorokin’s chameleonic talents, which allowed her to persuade everyone from old money philanthropists to tech disrupters that she belonged among them. While she’s hardly the Robin Hood “folk hero” her lawyer presents her as, it’s hard not to enjoy observing such a skilled (con) artist at work. 
But where Inventing Anna is buoyed by the levity and high camp of it all, it struggles more in its attempts at gravitas, not least in some heavy-handed reflections on whether the imposter is any less authentic than her peers, or less self-interested than the journalist. Still, the series can only be seen as a worthwhile endeavour given that the healthy advance Sorokin was paid by Netflix for the rights has reportedly gone some way toward repaying her debts.

Among a field of big hitters announced today there is also recognition for sci-fi blockbuster Dune (10 nominations), Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story (seven) and Belfast, Kenneth Branagh’s coming-of-age story (seven).
The Academy would love the 2022 awards to be a comeback story. Last year, a low-key, Covid-affected ceremony saw a dramatic fall-off in TV ratings. The hope is that the return of a grand bash filled with star names and box-office successes will help draw back public attention. 
Among the Best Picture contenders, The Power of the Dog reached most of its audience through streaming. Some rivals such as Dune have pulled significant crowds into cinemas, but West Side Story delivered a flat commercial performance despite enthusiastic reviews. Other nominees include Belfast; King Richard, biopic of Richard Williams, father and coach of Venus and Serena; Japanese breakout hit Drive My Car and another Netflix title, comedy cause célèbre Don’t Look Up. 
Jane Campion, nominated as Best Director for The Power of the Dog, was previously shortlisted in 1994 for The Piano. A victory at next month’s ceremony would make this the first time a woman took the prize two years running (Chloé Zhao having won in 2021 for Nomadland), yet Campion remains the only woman nominated in a category of five. 
In the acting categories, more recognition for The Power of the Dog finds Benedict Cumberbatch nominated for Best Actor alongside bookies’ favourite Will Smith, up for his performance in King Richard. The leading contender for Best Actress remains Nicole Kidman, cast as Lucille Ball in biopic Being the Ricardos. The Power of the Dog features too in both supporting categories, with nominations for Kodi Smit-McPhee, Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst.
Netflix will be hoping the 2022 Oscars make a good news story every bit as much as the Academy after last month’s dizzying fall in the price of its stock. Aside from Campion’s film, the streamer has four nominations for Don’t Look Up and a further two for Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical tick, tick . . . BOOM!. Apple’s filmmaking arm takes three nominations each for The Tragedy of Macbeth and the poignant comedy-drama CODA (nominated for Best Picture).
Among the old-school studios, Warner Bros may see partial vindication in the many nominations of Dune after facing anger from leading film-makers over its policy of releasing films in cinemas and on its HBO Max streaming platform simultaneously. As a big box-office hit, the movie’s prominence may also stem criticism that the Oscars now mostly reward films little seen by audiences.
For the Academy, there will be further relief if it avoids a repeat of the controversies around diversity that have beset the awards in recent years. The next step will be to try to restore TV audiences and a general sense of cultural heft. In that respect, some planning detail is still needed. As the Oscars announced their nominations, it was still unknown who — if anyone — will actually host the ceremony on March 27.
The nominees in the four main awards categories are as follows:
BelfastKenneth Branagh’s autobiographical tale of a Protestant family living through the Troubles in the late 1960s
CODASian Heder’s drama about a hearing teenager who is a child of deaf parents
Don’t Look UpAdam McKay’s satire about an impending global disaster

These are the main storylines in Perfect Strangers, the first Arabic-language film produced by Netflix, which has topped the platform’s most-viewed charts in Arab countries as far apart as Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia since its release on January 20.
But the remake of the Italian film, which sees dinner party guests share the messages they receive on their mobile phones over the course of an evening, has caused an uproar in Egypt, prompted calls to ban Netflix and unleashed a backlash against Mona Zaki, its Egyptian star.
In socially conservative Egypt — like elsewhere in the Arab world — a swath of public opinion has long been suspicious of what is considered to be a western conspiracy to spread moral corruption.
Mostafa Bakry, a pro-regime member of the Egyptian parliament, recently presented an “urgent statement” to the assembly, speaking against the movie and calling on the government to block Netflix. He portrayed the film as an attempt by western enemies to “destabilise” Arab countries.
“When a movie like this comes along, an exact copy of an Italian film without any deference to Egyptian and Arab moral and values . . . when it defends homosexuality, when more than 20 obscene words are used . . . when I see this I totally realise that the Egyptian and the Arab family is being targeted,” he said in a television interview.
Al-Azhar, a prestigious Islamic religious institution that is influential across the Sunni Muslim world, has also weighed in. Without naming the film, it said in a statement that “rebelling against virtue and turning against the sound values of society . . . is not freedom, liberation or creativity, but corruption [and] the weakening of society”.
In most Arab countries, movies are censored before distribution to ensure they do not promote breaches of mainstream family values, but Netflix can stream content into people’s homes without being vetted.
While the film does not have any graphic scenes, many see it as an attack on Arab social norms. For instance, the gay man in the film is not shunned by his friends and a father tells his 18-year-old daughter over the phone that she is free to decide if she will spend the night with her boyfriend. Netflix has not commented on the uproar.
Defenders of the film have noted that Egyptian cinema, an industry with a long and rich history, has previously dealt with marital infidelity and featured gay characters. But those films generally underlined the importance of mainstream family values. 
The shock this time, some say, comes from the “normalisation” of behaviour seen in Arab societies as aberrant. “It’s not good to show something but offer no solutions,” said Ghada Youssef, a retired banker. “No one’s conscience awakens, no one retreats from their ways and no one is punished at all. The film should have had a message.”
Ghada Shahbender, a scriptwriter and human rights activists, said the public opprobrium reflected in part the emergence of “clean cinema” in Egypt, which avoids offending conservative values.
“All the secrets revealed by the film exist in Arab societies and across all classes, but there is this duality which makes people refuse to acknowledge it,” she said. She also argued that since the rise of the internet in Arab countries public discourse about the arts had been driven by popular views on social media rather than “elitist” critics. 
The wave of anger has been particularly directed towards Zaki, who has mostly played “clean” roles in the past but shocked her fans by appearing as a wife who exchanges sexy texts with a stranger.
Other stars have hastened to her defence and the actors union has issued a statement warning that it “will not stand by and take no action against any verbal attack or attempt to intimidate an Egyptian actor as a result of work to which they have contributed”.
Defenders of the film have said those who were offended only needed to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. Some prominent voices have also argued that a more important factor is the film’s artistic merit.
“It’s totally wrong to evaluate a film from a moral perspective,” said Elham Shahin, a major Egyptian star, on a talk show.

https://www.ft.com/content/ac4261a4-ef39-4fc8-a01a-94894e88000b,John Gapper,The subscription shuffle is tiring Netflix and Peloton,2022-01-28,05:00:10,"It is expensive to be an avid American fan of costume drama. The first episode of Julian Fellowes’ series The Gilded Age was broadcast on the subscription service HBO Max this week, while Downton Abbey, his earlier one, is available on Amazon Prime. In March, Netflix will show the second series of Bridgerton for subscribers who pay $15.50 per month. 
The cost of needing to pay for a plethora of streaming video services to watch all you want is starting to hurt Netflix, which pioneered streaming and has 222m subscribers globally. Its shares fell 20 per cent last week after it disclosed that its growth in new subscribers has slowed as competition bites. 
Netflix is not the only one in the doldrums, having benefited from people paying for home entertainment in the pandemic. Peloton, the home fitness group that charges $2,495 for its flagship exercise bicycle and another $39 a month for full access to online classes, was this week attacked for its “listless strategy” by an activist investor that wants its chief executive to resign.
Is this the coming of subscription fatigue, the long-awaited phenomenon of people getting tired of paying monthly fees for everything from streaming video and audio to razor blades and home-delivered vegetable boxes? With the average UK subscriber household paying £620 for services last year, according to Barclaycard Payments, surely something has to give?
Some doubt whether people are tiring. “Subscription fatigue is not happening any time soon, at least not in entertainment,” says Michael Wolf, chief executive of Activate, the US consulting firm. It estimates that the average US paid video streaming subscriber had 4.4 subscriptions last year, and predicts that this will rise to 5.8 by 2025, despite Netflix’s travails.
But I admit to some confusion. As well as the Apple TV Plus subscription I took to watch The Morning Show, and have not got around to cancelling, there is my underused membership of the local lido (it has been chilly) and a small fee charged monthly by Amazon Japan, the reason for which I have forgotten.
It is hard to keep track of all this stuff and not always easy to decide whether it might come in useful at some point. Do I want a monthly subscription to Lonely Planet, in case I can travel again? Why is my family signed up to Dropbox as well as iCloud and should I fix it? Will I ever escape Microsoft 365?
Then there is the tiresome behaviour of companies that make it a lot easier to join than to leave. Virgin Media, for example, has a broad array of broadband and television upgrades available on its website, but perish the thought that you want to cancel or to spend less. That requires a long wait to get through to its call centre, or writing Virgin a letter and posting it.
Since Dollar Shave Club disrupted Gillette by selling razors cheaply on subscription and digital advertising failed to provide the hoped-for cushion for free media content, every company seems to crave subscribers (including the Financial Times). So do many writers and creators, thanks to platforms such as Patreon and Substack, and it would feel remiss not to support some of them.
The world’s lurch towards subscriptions is not bad in itself. Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist, once pointed out that, “to claim that consumers have ‘subscription fatigue’ is to say that they have ‘spending fatigue’”. People always had to decide whether to buy things or not and whether those things were necessities or luxuries: all that has changed is that they subscribe to more.
Recommended
Indeed, I favour them in the media business, quite apart from the fact that they pay a chunk of my wages. It is not a coincidence that Netflix produces a lot of high quality content — it has to be distinctive and compelling to persuade people to pay for it individually, rather than surfing homogenous channels.
If anything, fatigue may be worse among media companies than their subscribers. It is easy enough to subscribe for a while to a streaming service and then switch off again — what is known as churn. A canny viewer can binge-watch a popular series in a single weekend, sometimes on a free trial.
As viewers become more adept at shuffling their subscriptions, companies are having to spend constantly on new films and series to excite them. “The decay rate on streaming content . . . is incredibly rapid,” the analyst Michael Nathanson wrote after Netflix’s disappointing results.
Subscribers can be energetic, if given the chance. But we need to be able to keep on top of what we pay for, rather than seeing fees debited from cards and accounts and vaguely wondering why. Having a single dashboard for all subscriptions might be an impossible dream, but I wish it were easier.
We also face deliberate barriers such as “click here to subscribe, call to cancel”, or attempts to keep us paying through neglect. Regulators should examine such tactics carefully — India’s

Is the streaming service a savvy disrupter that will live on forever as the first mover of online entertainment? Or is it a house of cards, pushing an unsustainable business model that all of Hollywood foolishly followed?
In the past few months, investors have leaned towards the more steely-eyed view of Netflix’s prospects. Its share price has nearly halved over that time, falling from $700 to $366, wiping away $150bn in market value. At its peak in October, Netflix traded at a multiple of more than 10 times trailing revenue, well above its peers in media such as Disney. Now it is down to 5.6 times. 
Normally, Netflix’s rivals would enjoy the schadenfreude. Hollywood executives have long resented the company’s magical ability to lose money and rise in market value. But, instead, the sell-off has been unsettling because all of these companies have copied the Netflix model. 
After spending several years watching Wall Street cheer on Netflix, Disney, Warner and other media giants announced in 2019 grand plans to make their own streaming services. Their stock prices benefited. Their chief executives got their bonuses. All was well. 
The problem is that the long-term business case for streaming is still being tested. Streaming’s predecessor, cable TV, is expensive, inflexible and inconvenient for consumers — which is part of the reason it made a lot of money and provided income for the studios. People could cancel their cable TV packages, but it was not easy, and there was not much of an alternative.
Netflix broke the dam, and in doing so grew rapidly. At the time, it was too early to know whether Netflix would become sustainably profitable, and if so, how profitable. Nearly a decade after Netflix leapt into Hollywood, starting to produce its own content with House of Cards, we are getting a clearer picture. 
In Netflix’s early days, it was easy to lap up subscribers, but recently it has become a slog in the US. Last week, Netflix stock had its worst day in a decade after reporting subscriber numbers that did not satisfy Wall Street. 
But does Netflix need to keep adding a rip-roaring number of new customers to be a good business? 
Netflix believers have argued that by adding more subscribers, revenue would balloon while costs would stabilise as it built up its content library. Making 100 new TV shows for its 200m subscribers is better than making those same 100 shows for 100m subscribers. As its heft grew, Netflix could also raise prices, enabling even higher revenue. 
In practice, it has been more complicated. After being fed all this TV for a low price, viewers have become hungrier, stingier and more impatient. I recently signed up for a free trial of Showtime so I could see Yellowjackets, a TV show my friends were watching. I binged it all in a weekend and then cancelled the free trial, never paying anything to Showtime. Why wouldn’t I?
“The decay rate on streaming content is incredibly rapid. Squid Game? That’s so last quarter”, Michael Nathanson, a top media analyst, wrote last week. “The business model is much more capital intensive than most other models we have seen.” 
So even with 222m subscribers, Netflix has to keep spending, and a lot, to satiate us. Last year, Netflix posted negative free

		— the money left after paying operating expenses and capital expenditure — of $159m on $30bn of revenue. 
MoffettNathanson projects that, for 2022, Netflix revenue will rise 13 per cent to more than $33bn, but expenses will increase 15 per cent to $27bn ($20bn of this on content). This results in net income of $5bn, down about 3 per cent from 2021. 
So Netflix makes a lot of revenue but much less cash flow profit, because its costs are high. In this sense, Netflix’s long-term business might look more like a telco than a tech company. The biggest US telecoms groups have to invest heavily to offer the best service, while also keeping prices low because they are effectively selling the same product as their competitors. Netflix was in its own category for a while. Now, it is surrounded by competition. 
The stock market has spent the past decade rewarding Netflix for its vision and growth. For a long time, that made old studio executives angry. But what Netflix’s results have shown us recently is something more fundamentally scary for Hollywood: streaming television is going to make less money — maybe a lot less money — for entertainment companies than cable did. 
“They are replacing a great model for a less great model,” says Nathanson. “By a mile.”

“Many of our best investments have emerged when other investors, whose time horizons are short term, discard great companies at prices that look extraordinarily attractive when one has a long-term horizon”, Ackman wrote. 
Netflix’s stock price has dropped more than 40 per cent from an October peak of about $700 per share. The stock sold off more than 20 per cent on Friday after the company warned subscriber growth would slow substantially in the first three months of 2022. 
Over the past decade, Netflix’s shares have soared as the company pioneered a streaming model that upended Hollywood. But it has become besieged by competition as media groups such as Disney and WarnerMedia launched their own rival services. 
Ackman said he was attracted to Netflix because of the scale of its streaming business, which he said had the potential to attract subscribers and charge them higher prices. He also said the company’s pipeline of content could allow it to fend off competition and boost margins.

Netflix’s growth in the US and Canada has flatlined in the past year, as the streaming pioneer is besieged by competition from the old media companies it had disrupted. The company added 1.2m US and Canadian subscribers in the fourth quarter and ended 2021 with 75.2m subscribers in the US and Canada, rising from 73.9m the previous year.
After several years on the sidelines, the world’s largest media companies have sought to fight back against Netflix with their own products. In the past few years, Warner, Disney and others have launched streaming services, each spending billions of dollars on content to attract subscribers. 
Netflix stock has lost more than 40 per cent of its value in the past couple of months as growth has slowed. Still, it remains the leader by a wide margin, with 222m subscribers. 
HBO Max struggled to gain traction initially, despite WarnerMedia owning one of the most valuable portfolios in Hollywood, including the Warner Bros film and television studios, HBO and CNN.
Jason Kilar, chief executive of WarnerMedia, told the Financial Times this month that HBO Max “broke through” in 2021 after a slow start. The streaming service added 7m retail US subscribers in 2021, including 1.3m in the fourth quarter, helped by a programming slate containing new seasons of Succession, Insecure and Warner Bros movies such as Dune.
But the company remains well behind Disney, whose own Netflix challenger Disney Plus reached 118m global subscribers in October.
Globally, Warner counted 74m subscribers across both HBO Max and HBO’s cable channel by the end of 2021, including 47m in the US. People who pay for HBO’s television channel have access to the streaming service for free.
News of Warner’s subscriber growth came as its parent company AT&T reported $5bn net income on $40.6bn revenue in the fourth quarter. Shares in AT&T climbed 2 per cent in pre-market trade.
The company added 884,000 new wireless phone customers, taking the full-year number to 3.2m, roughly in line with analysts’ expectations and preliminary results released this month. Rival US carrier Verizon reported an increase of 558,000 subscribers on Tuesday, which was above market expectations.
In fibre, which is a major area of focus for the company, AT&T added 271,000 new customers and 1m across the full year. 
Excluding the US video business, which was separated from the AT&T group in the third quarter of last year, the company reported a 6 per cent increase in full-year business revenues to $153.2bn.
In what amounted to the fourth major directional change for its business, AT&T announced in May that it was going to sell its media assets, including Discovery, and get back to its core telecoms business. It then sought to play catch-up with rivals that pulled ahead in rolling out 5G infrastructure.
“We’re confident in our ability to compete on 5G,” said John Stankey, AT&T’s chief executive since 2020, on Wednesday. “We aim to be the US’s best 5G and fibre provider.”

It was, the company said, its “strongest content slate ever”. 
But the star-studded new releases were not enough to give Netflix a significant boost in subscribers in the fourth quarter. The video streaming pioneer said on Thursday that 8.3m new subscribers signed up for the service in the fourth quarter, the lowest number it had added in the period since 2017.
Worse, it forecast that it would add only 2.5m subscribers in the current quarter — down from 4m last year and well below its first quarter performance over each of the past five years. Investors dumped the stock on Friday, sending the shares down nearly 22 per cent to $397.69. They have fallen by more than 40 per cent since the height of Squid Game mania in November.
Recommended
Beyond the weak guidance, the company’s performance raised bigger questions about its business model. Among them: what happens if popular new shows are not enough to lure lots of new subscribers to Netflix any more? 
“Squid Game came out a week before [the fourth quarter] started, but the biggest hit of all time on Netflix was not enough to add subscribers,” said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Co, who has a sell rating on the stock. “Content is no longer a competitive advantage,” especially with traditional media groups investing heavily in their own streaming services. 
Netflix is expected to spend $18bn on content this year, according to Morgan Stanley estimates, as it seeks to maintain its lead against competitors including Disney Plus, AT&T’s HBO Max, Apple TV Plus, Amazon Prime, ViacomCBS’ Paramount Plus and others. The FT has estimated that eight US media companies will spend $140bn on content this year as the streaming wars intensify, and analysts expect spending to increase by double digits in the next few years. 
Investors appear to be waking up to the high cost of the streaming business — and the often short shelf life of content on the services. After the Netflix report, analysts at MoffettNathanson noted that the “decay rate” of streaming content was “incredibly rapid”, especially when popular programming could be binged in a single night. 
This means that “streamers have to continuously spend on new content to grab and hold new members, with any slowdown in that spend resulting in a softer quarter” for subscriber growth, the firm said in a research note. 
“We question whether or not streaming is a good business,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at the firm. “It requires a tonne of fresh content.” 
Netflix said its higher content spending compressed operating margins to 8 per cent in the fourth quarter, down 6 percentage points compared with a year earlier. Raising its margins significantly would mean spending less on content, which many see as unlikely given the intensity of competition in the streaming market. 
Netflix raised its prices in the US this month to $15.50 per month from $14 — a premium to the $8 per month charged by Disney Plus. Netflix officials emphasised last week that subscriber churn had gone down in the fourth quarter, and they said plans to break even and become free

		positive this year were on track.
Netflix, Disney and other streaming companies racked up huge subscriber gains during the 2020 lockdowns, but a return to more normal routines has slowed growth.
The company blamed the disappointing subscriber growth in part on “macroeconomic hardship in several parts of the world”, notably Latin America. It said competition “may be affecting our marginal growth”, a rare acknowledgment that it was facing pressure from other streaming services. But it added that it continued to grow in every country in which its rivals had launched.
Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said it was hard to pinpoint the cause of the slowdown because “Covid has introduced so much noise”.
But Martin said Netflix was underestimating the impact that rising competition was having on its subscription growth. “Part of the problem is that Netflix doesn’t think they have a problem,” she said. “I’ve come to the conclusion that competition is real but they haven’t come to that conclusion yet.”
She said the streaming market would become more stable once there was a period of consolidation, which she thinks would happen in three years or earlier.
“Three [streamers] have to go bankrupt and three have to survive,” she said. “And then content can become more reasonable in terms of its pricing.”
For his part, Hastings said there was no reason to question the company’s trajectory. “We’re staying calm,” he said.

The streaming company projected after the close of trade on Thursday that it would add just 2.5m subscribers in the first three months of this year, far fewer than the 4m it added in the first quarter of 2021 and well below analysts’ expectations that also stood at 4m. 
Netflix shares dropped 24 per cent in early trading on the Nasdaq, wiping about $55bn from the group’s market value. The Nasdaq 100 stock index was down about 1 per cent, while Europe’s Stoxx 600 tech index was down 2.4 per cent. 
Netflix’s disappointing forecast came as Peloton was forced to rush out preliminary second-quarter earnings to shore up investor confidence after CNBC reported the company was temporarily halting production of its connected fitness products. Shares in Peloton, one of the biggest beneficiaries of early Covid-19 lockdowns, fell about a quarter following the report on Thursday, but had pared losses slightly in a 4 per cent rebound on Friday. 
John Foley, Peloton’s co-founder and chief executive, said “rumours that we are halting all production of bikes and [treadmills] are false” but conceded the company was “right-sizing our production . . . as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves”. Peloton’s market value has plummeted in the past 12 months to about $8bn from $50bn.
Netflix and Peloton were among a clutch of “stay at home” stocks that investors snapped up at various stages of the pandemic, and the sharp decline in their share prices came amid growing investor angst over shares in companies that benefited from the pandemic. 
BlackRock’s “virtual work and life” ETF, which was launched during the first wave of the virus to track companies that would prosper from people spending more time at home, is trading close to a record low. It is down 9 per cent since the start of the year and more than 40 per cent below the peak it hit last year.
Shares in Zoom, the videoconferencing service that became ubiquitous as people worked from home, have fallen more than 15 per cent since the start of the year, including a 3 per cent drop on Friday morning. Other pandemic beneficiaries such as e-signature specialist DocuSign and Netflix rival Roku have tumbled more than 20 per cent in 2022.

		index entered correction territory this week, meaning it has fallen more than 10 per cent from its high in November. 
Streaming companies such as Netflix and Disney Plus hoovered up huge numbers of subscribers during the 2020 lockdowns, but a return to more normal routines has hit growth just as they are spending billions of dollars on content to attract and keep viewers. 
Netflix also undershot expectations for net new subscribers in the last quarter of 2021, adding 8.3m versus expectations ranging from 8.4m to 8.7m. That brought the total number of paying customers to 222m.
The slowdown in Netflix subscriber growth came even as it has assembled one of the strongest catalogues of original content since its launch, including the Korean hit drama Squid Game and Don’t Look Up, a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence.
The streaming wars are leading the big services to spend more on content. Netflix said the amount it was spending had compressed operating margins to 8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021 — down 6 percentage points compared with a year earlier. However, Netflix did not spend as much on content as it had forecast. 
Netflix noted that “competition . . . has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering”.
The company acknowledged that the increased rivalry “may be affecting our marginal growth” but said it continued to grow in every country in which its competitors had launched.

https://www.ft.com/content/eb35d6f9-2b96-479b-b036-4c5d596bcf83,Dan Einav,The House brings dark animated tales of home ownership to Netflix,2022-01-12,15:45:10,"It may be hard for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder, but no matter how disheartened one gets, it’s probably best to turn down a free home if it’s offered to you by a cackling, nefarious architect in the woods. 
That’s just one of the many bits of prudent advice one can glean from watching The House, a new collection of outré, stop-motion animated fables for adults that all take place in an eerie abode. Others concern sales (make sure nobody moves in during an open-house viewing) and renovations (bohemian handymen may steal your floorboards to construct a boat). 
It perhaps goes without saying at this point that the Netflix show — a collaboration between the award-winning Irish playwright Enda Walsh and the feted Nexus animation studio — is something of a curiosity. The House anarchically resists any neat categorisation by genre or style. Instead, it happily occupies the tenebrous corridors and liminal spaces between comedy and horror, art and entertainment, commentary and undiluted absurdity.
The changeable nature of the programme, in which the house and a pervasive uncanny atmosphere are the only constants, is largely down to the fact that each of the three half-hour tales has been developed by different directors, bringing their own style. 
The first is a period piece that follows a family of black-eyed, macrocephalic humanoids who try to reclaim their long-faded nobility after the father (voiced by Matthew Goode) signs a Faustian pact which lets them move from their crumbling cottage into a grand mansion. It soon transpires that the house is possessed by the sadistic spirit of its designer, who toys with and tortures his residents.
Then, just as things arrive at a dramatic crescendo, the story ends, and the series moves from the sinister to the deadpan. We find ourselves with an anxious property developer (Jarvis Cocker) who, unusually for a rodent, toils to make the house more presentable for sale. In the way that fastidious attention to detail converges with some disarming visual gags, it plays out almost like a mini Wes Anderson film — one shot through with desperation rather than whimsy.
The last chapter — which revolves around a landlady and her hippieish feline tenants (literal cool cats, one played by Helena Bonham Carter), in a house left marooned by an ecological disaster — again brilliantly subverts expectations. Here, the look turns from nightmarish to oneiric; the humour becomes gentler and the emotions more sensitively handled. 
It’s possible to see morals to these stories — the trappings of superficial materiality, the vanity of self-improvement — though perhaps better just to be swept away by the gleeful ambiguity and strangeness of it all. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but if you’re the kind of person who prefers an attic filled with cluttered gems to a meticulously curated living room, then this is one house well worth visiting.

“It’s fair to say it’s becoming a three-horse race at the front of the pack,” Jason Kilar told the FT. “With regards to storytelling . . . and when you look at the US subscriber numbers, things drop off a fair bit after the first three horses.”
The company last week reported it had reached 74m subscribers to HBO Max and HBO by the end of 2021, up from 61m in 2020. People who pay for HBO’s television channel have access to the streaming service for free. 
Despite Kilar’s enthusiasm, HBO Max is still well behind Netflix and Disney, which reported 214m and 118m subscribers, respectively, at the start of October.
Warner’s numbers also come with a caveat: the 74m includes people who pay for HBO’s cable channel. The company has been encouraging these customers to sign up for HBO Max, which they get for free. Kilar said the “vast majority” of the 74m are using HBO Max, but declined to provide specifics. 
Warner in 2020 launched HBO Max, throwing its hat into the ring as traditional media groups look to compete with Netflix and secure their spot in a digital entertainment world. AT&T, the telecoms group that owns WarnerMedia, hired Kilar, a streaming veteran who previously co-founded Hulu, to build out HBO Max.
HBO Max had a slow start, despite holding one of the most prized portfolios in entertainment — including Warner Bros film and television studios, the HBO network and a portfolio of cable channels including CNN. 
The service was for several months marred by technical glitches, consumer confusion and a negotiations stand-off that prevented people from watching HBO Max on Roku’s popular streaming devices.
The company has added 13m subscribers in the past year, helped by a slate of programming including new seasons of Succession and Insecure, as well as a bold strategy to release all Warner Bros films to HBO Max for no additional fee. 
Disney Plus’s 118m in October was up by 44m subscribers from a year earlier — a much faster pace of growth. However, Disney’s service costs considerably less than HBO Max and was boosted by a push into India, where subscribers pay less than a dollar a month. 
Kilar said Warner would invest more than $18bn on content this year as it looks to keep pace with rivals. The top eight US media groups plan to spend at least $115bn on new movies and television shows this year, the FT has calculated, as they seek to pad their streaming services.
Disney and Netflix are expected to spend more than $33bn and $17bn each in 2022. “What you’re seeing is those folks in those positions are investing aggressively,” said Kilar. “We’re one of those companies.”
HBO Max has been unable to launch in the UK due to a licensing agreement with Sky. When asked when the service would debut in the UK, Kilar said: “It’s our ambition to bring HBO Max to the UK. I’m trying not to be cagey about it, but we do have a contract that obviously is important to us.”
WarnerMedia is set for its second change in ownership in three years. AT&T in May agreed to spin off and combine WarnerMedia with rival Discovery, just three years after acquiring the company, a humbling retreat from Hollywood for the telecom company. 
That transaction is expected to close this year, pending approval from regulators. Kilar was largely kept in the dark about AT&T’s negotiations to divest of WarnerMedia. Observers expect he will leave the company when the deal closes. 
When asked whether he planned to exit, Kilar demurred: “I get that question a lot. I haven’t shared my plans but I will later this year.”

A stylishly dressed woman drives home in her shiny BMW to her smart house in the suburbs where she lives with three perfect children, a loving partner and a kitchen island the size of Ibiza. Life is good for this family who look like they’ve just stepped out of a John Lewis ad, which can only mean one thing: catastrophe is coming. 
The first grenade comes in the form of a bottle of champagne left on the doorstep to celebrate the couple’s impending wedding, 16 years into their relationship. The accompanying card is addressed to Cassie, but there’s no one of that name here — or is there? It turns out Cush Jumbo’s Megan isn’t who she says she is, a fact confirmed by the appearance of old pal Lorraine (Sarah Parish) who brings unwelcome news from her former life. “Cassie’s dead. That life is over,” Megan tells her with the expression of a woman who can’t believe she has to deliver such a shoddy line. Why didn’t she heed the family rules written on their kitchen blackboard, the last of which is — clank! — “Always tell the truth”?
There’s a lot to keep track of in the first few episodes, which strain hard to link all the disparate strands. Megan, we discover, isn’t the only one with a murky past. See also Richard Armitage’s photographer, Ray, who is on his uppers and who finds an image of a missing man, Carlton Flynn, buried in his back-up files, and DS Broome (James Nesbitt), who can’t let go of an unsolved case from 17 years ago, much to the chagrin of his partner and ex-wife, DS Cartwright (Jo Joyner). And did I mention Megan’s teenage daughter who met Flynn on the night he went Awol?
Adapted by Danny Brocklehurst, the series is based on the book by Harlan Coben, who also provided the source material for the Netflix thriller The Stranger and who evidently enjoys blowing up the lives of suburban families. There is some odd casting here, most notably in Eddie Izzard as a heroin-addicted lawyer who you can never forget is Eddie Izzard. But Jumbo expertly conveys the panic of the rug being pulled out from under her and there is just enough suspense to counterbalance the script’s frequent lapses into silliness.

https://www.ft.com/content/d92a8157-5cf7-49a0-be10-f4000eed1894,Fiona Sturges,Emily in Paris is back on Netflix with another series of silliness,2021-12-20,05:00:53,"No sooner had the first season of Darren Star’s comedy-drama about a Midwestern ingénue parachuted to Paris arrived last year than its fate seemed sealed. Arriving in time for a second lockdown, the series’s parade of lazy French clichés and its blundering, Instagram-obsessed heroine, played by Lily Collins, provoked howls of outrage not heard since EastEnders went on an awayday to Ireland where donkeys wandered the streets. Cancellation would surely follow.
But its glossy portrayal of reprobate Parisians — they smoke! They eat their steak rare! Monsters! — and Emily’s innate annoyingness had the opposite effect, sending ratings into orbit and making it the most successful hate-watch (or is that guilty pleasure?) of recent times. But wait, was this all part of the creators’ master plan? Certainly, the moment Emily threw open the shutters of her top-floor apartment upon arrival and gasped, “The entire city looks like Ratatouille!” felt less like appreciation than an act of provocation.
And so here it is for a second run, sticking steadfastly to its formula of bonkers fashion, picture-postcard scenery and silly plot lines. La Haine this is not. But there is also a noticeable dialling down of xenophobic tropes. The Gallic monstrousness of Emily’s colleagues at the marketing firm where she works has been softened, with Sylvie, the boss modelled on The Devil Wears Prada’s Miranda Priestly, even turning up to her bijou birthday party. An entente cordiale has clearly been reached. And while Emily’s French hasn’t moved beyond basic pleasantries — her refusal to attempt the language in the last series was presented as an adorable quirk — she is now at least taking classes.
Emily is still Emily, however, and her ill-judged liaison with Lucas Bravo’s chef, who happens to be her friend Camille’s boyfriend, accounts for most of the drama here as she tries and fails to keep what happened under wraps. The tonal tweaks to the series are welcome, but the cartoonish self-centredness of its lead remains infuriatingly in place. 
Starr, the brains behind Sex and the City, was once the master of candid women-centric metropolitan comedies, although between this and the current below-par SATC reboot And Just Like That, all evidence suggests the magic has departed. While Emily in Paris provides escapism of sorts, one’s tolerance of it depends on how much you’d like to see Mademoiselle thrown off the top of the Eiffel Tower.

https://www.ft.com/content/8a794fb5-3bcc-412d-afe6-0db9389b24eb,Samuel Agini,Hamilton and Verstappen’s title decider rewards F1’s new Netflix fans,2021-12-10,05:00:38,"Formula One’s Netflix bet is paying off. Drive to Survive, the streaming platform’s behind-the-scenes documentary, brought new fans to the motorsport. Now Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton are repaying the favour, producing the most gripping F1 title race in years.
In Abu Dhabi on Sunday, British driver Hamilton, 36, will compete for a historic record eighth driver’s title, while Dutchman Verstappen, 24, is hunting his maiden championship, with both drivers equal on points going into the finale of a topsy-turvy season that could end a Mercedes winning streak that goes back to 2014.
When Colorado-based Liberty Media took over F1 in an $8bn deal in 2017, the US investment company bet that building a digital media operation would make the difference in cracking markets like the US. Despite early scepticism from within the sport, senior figures say that strategy is starting to pay off in America.
The first three seasons of Drive to Survive distracted from the lack of action at the front of the grid, as Mercedes and Hamilton broke record after record. But this season’s title race and the multiple collisions between the two drivers, most recently in Saudi Arabia, have given Netflix a new narrative for the next instalment due for release next year.
“Things are crazy enough in real life and for sure things will be even crazier when you watch Drive to Survive next year,” said Toto Wolff, team principal and co-owner at Mercedes. “They are adding the Hollywood drama to what is drama enough already this season.”
Christian Horner, his opposite number at Red Bull, likened the title contest to another Netflix hit: “To take Mercedes to the final race, it feels a bit like Squid Games. You couldn’t script it to have both drivers tied on points going into the final race . . . They could do a complete season on Red Bull and Mercedes’ rivalry.”
But the success of Drive to Survive, which was first screened in 2019, holds clues to how sports can use digital media to attract new audiences, with a recent Nielsen survey finding that the average age of an F1 fan has fallen to 32 from 36 in 2017, while also providing Netflix with exclusive content to compete against streaming rivals. 
The tie-up with Netflix was initially met with distrust, with teams protective of the trade secrets that help them win on track and Mercedes and Ferrari both sitting out of the first season before swiftly changing tack.
But the platform turned drivers into heroes and introduced viewers to big personalities that were previously hidden behind helmets. Season 3, which was released in March, hit the top of Netflix’s rankings in 27 countries.
Stefano Domenicali, chief executive of F1, said Netflix and social media had helped F1 make a “big step” towards attracting younger audiences, crediting them with allowing drivers, “the jewels of our sport”, to connect with fans in new ways.
“I’m sure there will be so many people that are curious to see how the action on track will be translated in the narrative [of Drive to Survive],” he said. “For sure, content will not be a problem for that series.”
Lando Norris, at 22 one of the youngest drivers on the track, said: “The amount of people I see now that are saying, ‘I got into Formula One because of Netflix’ is huge.”
The McLaren racer also credits the show with driving up his own following, although he acknowledged that it’s hard “to always come across in the best way” in front of the camera.
Drive to Survive is part of a wider digital strategy adopted by Liberty Media, the investment vehicle controlled by US billionaire John Malone, to expand the sport, particularly in the US, where F1 previously struggled to gain traction.
Zak Brown, the American in charge of McLaren Racing, the British team in fourth place, pointed out it “wasn’t that long ago” that F1 was “very behind on the digital world”. In the years before Liberty acquired F1 from

		firm CVC Capital Partners, former F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone eschewed digital media after years of building the sport into a global phenomenon on the back of big-money television contracts and deals with race promoters.
Creating avid fans out of casual viewers? “Normally that takes years,” said Brown. “Netflix has helped do that in 10 episodes.”
F1 group revenues totalled $1.3bn in the first nine months of 2021, despite having to hold several races without full capacity crowds. In the same period last year they fell to $660m, down from almost $1.5bn in the season before the virus.
Although he is pleased to have overseen a recovery in F1 revenues, Greg Maffei, chief executive of Liberty Media, warned that the emergence of the Omicron strain of coronavirus could be a setback for the 2022 season amid plans for a record 23-race calendar.
Still, this year was a turning point for F1’s ambitions in the US. Roughly 400,000 spectators, including basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal, attended the Austin, Texas race weekend, up more than half versus 2018, with about two-thirds of them watching their first F1 Grand Prix. 
Mattia Binotto, team principal of Scuderia Ferrari, which has a firm grip on third place in the constructor’s championship, credits Netflix with attracting new fans. “We were really rock stars [in Austin this season],” he said. “That’s never been the case.”
An average of 1.2m people watched Austin live on ABC, according to ESPN, which holds the US broadcast rights until the end of next year. Average viewers per race this season stand at 933,000, up more than half on 2020 and nearly 40 per cent on 2019.
And F1 achieved a breakthrough to add Miami, Florida, to its calendar from next May, securing another crucial event in the timezone that counts for broadcasters accustomed to showing European races to American fans in the morning. Roughly 275,000 people have registered to buy tickets for Miami, with $9m of deposits paid by 1,800 people for luxury hospitality and suites.
“We can grow our average selling price for many of the kinds of events, particularly as we go to new venues like a Miami where the potential for higher revenue in the Paddock Club, [and] so hospitality, can go up,” said Maffei. “Our potential to renew broadcast at higher numbers . . . looks increasingly good. The US number is anaemic and it’s going to become a real number . . . and sponsorship will go up.”
Horner agreed, saying that Red Bull’s partnerships this season with the likes of technology group Oracle in March and

		company Tezos were “off the back of the success of Netflix”, which “suddenly opened Formula One up to the US”.
However, since the start of the pandemic F1 has deepened its ties to autocratic states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which both joined the circuit for the first time this season. Saudi Aramco, the kingdom’s oil company, struck a global sponsorship deal with F1 in March 2020, drawing criticism from human rights campaigners who accuse the fossil-fuel rich Gulf states of “sportswashing” their reputations. F1’s stance is that the sport can be a driving force for good in those countries.

Executives across F1 suggest that there is much more to do to capitalise on the success of Drive to Survive and early signs of growth in the US, ahead of negotiations for the next broadcast deal there. 
“Maybe the right thing to do is to have a third race in the States,” said Otmar Szafnauer, team principal of Aston Martin F1. “The country is big enough to do that.”
But bigger changes are coming to F1. In 2022, teams will have revamped cars designed to foster even greater competition by allowing drivers to race closer together and overtake each other more frequently. A new engine powered by sustainable fuels is expected in 2026. 
Much is riding on these innovations, which will shape the future of racing and the stories that are dramatised on Netflix.
Even Wolff, who is fighting to preserve Mercedes’ dominance, agrees with fans: “A sport that sees teams and drivers compete until the very end is what makes it so exciting.”

https://www.ft.com/content/69e1cc1e-9c64-4000-b47f-a7e448107a5b,Christopher Grimes,"Disney’s chief on his war with Netflix, irking the talent and breaking with the past",2021-12-09,05:00:03,"Bob Chapek is in his element. It is a cool November evening, and the chief executive of Walt Disney is settling in to watch the nightly fireworks high above Sleeping Beauty Castle. As the former head of the company’s theme parks, he has seen the show countless times here at Disneyland, but he still can’t resist the urge to snap photos. As the smoke clears, Chapek shows off his pictures, which seem to have captured the best moments. “After a while you learn when the finale is coming,” he chuckles. 
He knows this place intimately and, despite years of dealing with the crises and headaches that come with running some of the most scrutinised attractions on earth, it is clear Chapek still feels the Disney magic. He lets out whoop-whoops on a Cars Land ride, devours an enormous corn dog on a stick and recites the safety instructions for Soarin’, a multisensory ride that is among his favourites, along with the narrator. “I must have seen this 60 times,” Chapek says of the tongue-in-cheek video, “but it still gets me every time.” 
The evening at the park appears to be a happy diversion for Chapek, whose first 22 months as chief executive have been punishing. Just days after taking the job on February 25 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic shut down cinemas, theme parks, cruise lines, and film and TV production, leading to a near-collapse of Disney’s revenue. The Walt Disney Company survived the Great Depression, the second world war and periodic bouts of operatic management, but there was perhaps no blow as sudden or threatening as coronavirus. “He takes over the job and then 20 minutes later Covid hits,” says Alan Horn, the legendary film producer who will retire at the end of this month after nine years at the Walt Disney Studios, the company’s film and entertainment unit. “He’s had a rough year and a half.” 
With audiences trapped at home during Covid lockdowns, Chapek moved aggressively to promote Disney Plus, the company’s primary weapon in the streaming wars against Netflix, Amazon and other old-guard studios. Subscriptions soared. But in his pursuit of digital growth, he angered theatre owners, Hollywood stars — most notably Scarlett Johansson and CAA, the talent agency juggernaut that represents her — and even some of his own employees. 
Chapek’s experience running theme parks sets him apart from both his predecessors Bob Iger and Michael Eisner, who started at the bottom of American television and hustled their way to the top. They saw themselves as creative people at heart. But Chapek came into the CEO role as a relative unknown in Hollywood and on Wall Street, despite a nearly 30-year career at Disney that included successful stints running distribution for the Walt Disney Studios and as president of the home entertainment division. By his own description, he has spent his career with his “head down” as he focused on the job at hand. “Chapek is not a visible person,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. 
Perhaps that’s why the talent agents, attorneys, financial analysts and journalists who populate the American entertainment ecosystem tend to view him as a “parks guy” — an outsider, a number-cruncher, a cost-cutter. A former entertainment executive at Disney adds that Chapek’s reputation inside the company is “very operational”. 
The notion that he is merely a bean-counter irks Chapek. “I’ve seen creativity in this company through every lens possible,” he says in an exclusive interview. He compares running the theme parks with observing “a focus group every day” that gave him a unique perspective on “what makes the Walt Disney Company so different from any other media company”. He adds, “It ties us to our ultimate constituent, which is the consumer.” 
An American CEO saying that the customer is always right does not sound controversial, but this consumer focus is at the heart of what worries some actors, directors and agents in Hollywood. Consumers love streaming movies at home, and Chapek wants to double the number of Disney Plus subscribers in the next two years. But streaming is not good for the box office. And for decades, success at the box office has been a source of prestige in Hollywood and allowed top talent to make millions through the so-called backend, a bonus for hitting ticket-sales targets.
This tension has boiled over into a conflict over the two things people in Hollywood care about most: the magic of movies and the colour of money. Such concerns are rippling through other studios, too, and difficult contract negotiations are widely under way, reflecting the changing economics wrought by the streaming era. “We’re wading through all that,” explains Ari Emanuel, whose group Endeavor owns the William Morris talent agency. “We’re all going to get to the right number. It’s a very competitive environment, which is good. And Bob Chapek is very competitive.” 
Through the turmoil, some were comforted to know that Iger, Chapek’s larger-than-life predecessor, was still serving as chair and overseeing the company’s creative work. During his 15-year tenure as chief executive, Iger transformed Disney through a series of acquisitions that left it holding a collection of the most valuable franchises in the entertainment business. Now, with the 70-year-old Iger set to retire on December 31, Chapek will finally have the keys to the Magic Kingdom all to himself. 
When that happens, Chapek will take full control of the most iconic entertainment company in America during a period of change as profound as the arrival of television in the 1950s. He’ll have to convince Wall Street that he’s willing to go as far as it takes to win the streaming wars and simultaneously court those in Hollywood who either don’t know him very well or don’t trust him. Not to mention shut down internal carping; Iger raised doubts about Chapek’s strategy in the early months of the pandemic, according to people who spoke with him at the time.
None of which is much surprise to Chapek on our trip to Disneyland. His starting point is that times have changed, and the studios must change too, even those within Disney. He is unwavering in his view that his job is to deliver entertainment however people want it, not how Hollywood film-makers believe it should be. “We love theatrical exhibition. We love linear television,” he says. “But it’s not about what we love, it’s about what the consumer loves. They will be our guide.”
Born in 1960, Chapek grew up in a modest household in the industrial city of Hammond, Indiana, just across the state line from the south side of Chicago. “People aspired to get a union job and work in the steel mill, the oil refinery or the soap plant,” he recalls. “Ambition stopped at being able to provide for your family.” 
Both of his parents worked, and his mother’s income helped pay for little extras, including a road trip in the family Chevrolet to Florida every December. The first stop was always Orlando, some 1,800km south, home of Walt Disney World. “It was one of the two places where my love for the Disney brand was seeded,” he says. The Mary Poppins soundtrack was the first. Those trips left a strong imprint, Chapek says. “But that’s not to say I had any ambition or thought that I could ever work there, because that wasn’t something that was in reach for a kid from the region. It wasn’t in the cards.” 
Chapek loved science and hoped to study biology in college, an idea that his high school guidance counsellor dismissed. “She told me, ‘Why do you want to do that? Get a union job, pick one of the plants and retire at 50.’” 
Conflict has arisen over the two things people in Hollywood care about most: the magic of movies and the colour of money
He didn’t completely escape the factories. Chapek spent three summers working for American Maize, first in its dextrin plant, which produced glue for stamps and envelopes. In the Midwestern heat, the dextrin turned into glue in the air, sticking to his face. “It was a horrifying sight to look at me when I exited the factory because all you saw were my white eyeballs and the rest of my face was literally plastered with glue,” Chapek recalls. “I had to go to the bathroom every 15 minutes to throw water on my face.” 
He attended Indiana University in Bloomington, where he majored in microbiology. It was there he met his wife of 41 years, Cynthia Ford. After graduating, Chapek went to business school and found work at J Walter Thompson in Chicago, then the largest advertising agency in the US. Among the accounts he worked on was Kraft Singles cheese. “That was the beginning of my fascination with consumer behaviour,” he says. “I went headfirst into the creative side and found I really liked it.”
Chapek’s work with packaged products eventually led him to Disney in 1993, to an unglamorous corner of the business: home video. As head of marketing for Buena Vista Home Entertainment, his job was to persuade fans to build a library of Disney movies on tape or disc instead of renting them from Blockbuster. Chapek sold the movies just as he had sold processed cheese, working with the likes of Walmart and Target to move copies of The Mighty Ducks or 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.
After he was promoted to president of the home entertainment division in 2000, Chapek championed the “vault” strategy, which meant releasing a Disney animated classic on video, then pulling it off the market — or putting it “back in the vault” — for several years. This created a sense of scarcity and spurred demand. Chapek also built out the “direct-to-video” business on titles such as The Lion King 1½. It was a huge success, even if big-screen feature producers viewed the movies as second-rate. 
Among investors, the public and some in Hollywood, the general response to Chapek’s appointment as CEO last year was: Who is Bob Chapek? A packed schedule over the next few weeks was supposed to fix that, starting with meetings with Wall Street analysts in New York. Next up was a trip to Raleigh, North Carolina, to run his first Disney annual shareholders meeting. 
The first signs that Chapek’s tenure might be off to a rocky start came over the skies of North Carolina on March 10. As the corporate jet was about to land, the pilot announced that the governor had closed the state due to rising cases of Covid-19. “Closed the state?” Chapek recalls asking himself. “We didn’t know then what we were dealing with.” 
The usual sneak previews and other entertainment was quickly edited out of the programme, official business dispensed with and the meeting wrapped up. The next day the team flew to Orlando, which had been planned as a triumphant homecoming for Chapek, with Iger introducing him as CEO to his former fellow “cast members” at Walt Disney World. But this was no time for fun. “We did the town hall and left,” he says. “And the next day we closed the company.” 
It was a huge undertaking. Disney shut three parks: Disneyland Paris, Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California. (The parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo were already closed.) Disney’s four cruise ships were docked. Work on new film and television production was halted, leaving the ABC and ESPN TV networks as the only major business units still operating in North America.
Next, Chapek turned his attention to ensuring the survival of the Magic Kingdom, which suddenly had very little money coming in. Just a year earlier, Disney had closed on its $71bn acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Rupert Murdoch’s massive trove of film and TV assets that includes everything from The Simpsons to Aliens and Die Hard. The company financed the deal through stock and cash, while also taking on Fox’s $14bn in debt. Now it needed to raise billions more just to meet payroll. By March 20, Disney shares had fallen 39 per cent from just a month earlier.
Disney raised more than $20bn through debt offerings to weather the storm, while furloughing 100,000 workers. “Everybody has a 100-day plan” when they start as a CEO, Chapek says “But my 100-day plan was essentially derailed on day 10.” 
Both Iger and Chapek saw streaming as an era-defining opportunity. Executives say this is the biggest burst of innovation since the 1930s studio gold rush. But realising the opportunity requires old media groups to dismantle the very business models they’ve counted on for profits while pumping out more content than ever. 
The beginning of Disney Plus was something of an accident. In 2016, after noticing that Disney was selling a lot of its programming to streamers, Iger asked one of his top lieutenants, Kevin Mayer, to figure out whether brokering one big global deal with Netflix or Amazon would bring in more licensing revenue than individual auctions, according to people familiar with the discussions. Mayer returned with a message for Iger. “Yes, we can make more money by striking a global deal with Amazon.” But having seen how quickly streaming services were growing, he advised that Disney should consider creating its own instead. Iger responded, “Kevin, go build it.” Orders, in other words, to engage in an expensive battle with the deep-pocketed technology companies that have upended Hollywood.
Three years later, Disney Plus debuted publicly. It was Iger’s final gambit before stepping down as chief executive. He told investors repeatedly that the service was the “highest priority” for the company, crafting a narrative that he was taking a big swing that could lose money for the next five years but secure its survival for decades to come. He positioned the strategy as revolutionary: either remake Disney or face extinction. 
Chapek has never been a creature of Hollywood, leaving the mansions of Beverly Hills and Bel Air to the air-kiss set
Disney Plus has been an undeniable success. By stuffing the service full of spin-off programming from the company’s popular franchises — The Mandalorian in the Star Wars canon, WandaVision from Marvel — and pricing it at $6 a month, Iger and Mayer created a product that was an easy sell to American families. In less than a year and a half, 100 million people had signed up for Disney Plus, a feat that had taken Netflix more than a decade to achieve*. 
Iger’s swan song would also pay off for Chapek. Iger had so convinced Wall Street of the promise of streaming that Disney’s stock price floated higher, rebounding from pandemic lows to record highs even after other sources of revenue evaporated. In the two years after its debut, a media banker noted recently, Disney Plus generated more stock-market value than the entire market caps of General Motors or Ford. 
The surge in new subscribers was helped by Chapek’s decision to release some of Disney’s biggest movies on streaming the same day that they debuted in theatres. This strategy, known as “day and date” release, provides an obvious benefit for streaming services. But it is wildly unpopular with studio chiefs and actors, a fact that became clear after the release of Black Widow in July. 
Scarlett Johansson stars in the movie as superhero spy Natasha Romanoff, a member of the Avengers central to Marvel’s so-called cinematic universe. Johansson was paid $20m for the role and expected to earn as much as $50m more through a backend bonus, a bargaining chip used by the most-bankable actors when negotiating pay. But that contract had been hashed out years before Disney even had a streaming service.
Months earlier, WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar suffered a backlash after announcing that Warner’s full slate of 2021 films would be released for free on its streaming service, HBO Max. Dune director Denis Villeneuve described the move as a “hijacking”, while Tenet director Christopher Nolan called HBO Max “the worst streaming service”. Disney took a different tack, charging $30 to stream Black Widow and other new movies. The surcharge would count towards the traditional box-office formula to pay Johansson and other stars’ backend bonus. 
Johansson sued Disney, accusing the company of breaching her contract and juicing its stock price at her expense. A bitter PR battle ensued, which Disney lost after blasting out a statement accusing the star of “callous disregard” for the effects of the pandemic. In doing so, the wholesome Mickey Mouse brand found itself pitted against gender-equity activists, not to mention the Hollywood creative establishment that had been watching with self-interest from the sidelines. 
Talent and studio executives have been fighting over pay since before Louis B Mayer. But for a disagreement to become so public is rare. Even after Disney and Johansson settled in September, Chapek’s critics cite the episode as an example of inexperience. It certainly illustrated a difference in style from Iger. Chapek has “sharper elbows than what you would say is [typical on] the entertainment side of Disney,” says a former employee. “Probably more candid. Iger . . . will tell you what you want to hear, whether it’s what he is going to do or not. Chapek will be much more straightforward.”
Chapek’s verdict is that the strategy worked: “It turned out to be great for us and our films, great for the artists in our films and good for Disney Plus.”
Still, the halo around the streaming business has started to lose some of its shine since, even for industry darling Netflix. Investors are beginning to reassess the cost of the streaming arms race as America’s media giants spend tens of billions each to secure a spot in the future of show business. Disney Plus arrived in the same six-month span as similar products from AT&T and Comcast, both of which own film and television studios. Though the great media wave is already washing over consumers, even more is on the way: Disney alone has said it will spend $33bn on content (including sports rights) in 2022, while Netflix is expected to spend $22bn and WarnerMedia $18bn. As longtime media analyst Michael Nathanson puts it, streaming “isn’t a business for the faint of heart, the short-termers or those constricted by non-ethereal worries like free

		or net debt”. 
Few expect all of the current players to be left standing. “The fact is, people around the world five or 10 years from now are not going to pay for seven subscription services,” says John Sloss, an entertainment lawyer at Sloss Eckhouse Dasti Haynes and head of Cinetic Media, a talent management and advisory agency. “Everyone is putting all their resources into being the survivor. There will be consolidation eventually and some will go out of business.” 
Despite these concerns, Chapek is still promising investors that Disney Plus will meet its target of up to 260m subscribers by 2024 as new programming begins to emerge from the pandemic production bottleneck. Some who know the company well are sceptical. “Netflix has a broader appeal than Disney Plus. Disney brands are powerful, but somewhat limiting,” explains a former executive who worked on Disney’s streaming launch. “It’s going to be really hard to meet their target.” 
Some on Wall Street want Chapek to commit even further to streaming by severing Disney’s ties with its traditional TV properties ABC and ESPN. Chapek counters that ESPN can thrive in the streaming era and will find new ways to grow as sports betting becomes more common in the US. “We feel the Disney brand is broad enough to have an ESPN business under our roof,” he says.
Chapek last year launched a sweeping reorganisation of Disney’s entertainment business, putting streaming at the centre. He formed a new group to determine how best to distribute its television programmes and feature films, effectively stripping the studio’s chiefs of the authority to decide whether their work should debut on a streaming service or a “legacy” platform, such as TV or theatres. “If I left it to the individual creative groups in the company, everything would be going to the legacy platforms,” Chapek says. “How do you grow [streaming] if everything goes to the legacy platforms? I had to make that move.”
So he split off Disney’s production unit from its distribution team, which would be consolidated under Kareem Daniel, a Disney veteran who had worked in the company’s consumer products business. The plan was cheered by Wall Street, but Chapek’s hiring choices were questioned internally. “Kareem had zero knowledge of streaming,” notes a senior executive who left the company last year. Another former executive claims Disney under Chapek “became a club where the old members reasserted themselves. The only qualification they had was they had to have been around for 30 years at Disney and nowhere else.” 
Chapek defends the reorganisation, calling it “one of the best things I’ve done” and dismisses the criticism of Daniel, saying he values “talent over experience”. 
But Iger himself raised concerns with colleagues in the months after he handed Chapek the baton, according to three people familiar with the discussions. “He said the company was changing and he was concerned by the lack of innovation, the lack of strategy,” says one senior executive who spoke with Iger in the spring of 2020. When asked why he didn’t step in, Iger was said to have responded, “It’s complicated”. 
Disney declined to comment on the Iger-Chapek relationship. But some insiders note that the two men communicate frequently and have appeared together in recent town halls. Iger also wished Chapek luck in his farewell note to staff.
It has been difficult for Iger to say goodbye. He delayed his retirement four times, receiving a bigger pay package with each extension. Even as Iger announced that Chapek would replace him, he extended his run at the company for almost two years by creating a position overseeing Disney’s creative output, a job that will not be filled once he leaves. 
Around the time that Iger was contemplating retirement for the first time circa 2011, he decided to pay a visit to Chapek, who was then running Disney’s consumer products business. It was at this moment that Chapek first thought he might have a shot at running the company one day. “You go to see Bob,” Chapek explains. “You go to see him. This was the first time he jumped into a car and drove 10 miles to our Glendale campus and came to see me. It was nothing that was said. It was just, this is a different dynamic.”
Iger promoted Chapek a number of times, and the two seem to have bonded during the planning and opening of Shanghai Disney Resort in 2016, an enormously complicated undertaking that involved dealing with the highest ranks of the Chinese Communist party. In his memoir, Iger recounts working closely with Chapek in Shanghai when twin crises erupted back at home: a security threat in Orlando and a deadly alligator attack at Disney World. 
Following the meeting in Glendale, Chapek says there were occasional “breadcrumbs” that he might be in the running, but nothing overt. He certainly increased the numbers: Chapek more than doubled operating income while running the consumer products division and delivered 13 per cent average earnings growth at parks and resorts. 
By 2019, there was a list of candidates that included Chapek, Iger lieutenant Mayer and Peter Rice, a television executive who had joined the company through the Fox acquisition. That autumn, Iger told the Disney board he was finally ready to leave. “He is the kind of person who wanted to script his own exit and script it on a huge high,” says a colleague who reckons that the initial success of Disney Plus provided the perfect moment. Iger had also told friends he wanted to get a job with the incoming Biden administration. 
The horse race narrowed to two candidates — Mayer and Chapek — and the board, stacked with Iger loyalists, had effectively given him the final say. Iger and Mayer were viewed as a tag team, having co-engineered a series of transformative acquisitions. Mayer, nicknamed Buzz Lightyear for his energy, was the assumed frontrunner, having designed the streaming strategy that was, in Iger’s own words, the future of the company.
So it came as a surprise to investors, the press and Mayer himself when Disney announced in February 2020 that Bob Iger was stepping down and that Bob Chapek would replace him. (Since then, the two have been referred to inside the company as “Bob I” and “Bob C”.) Mayer had been kept in the dark. He tells friends that he holds no ill will towards Chapek and he remains close with Iger; the two speak a couple of times a week. 
“It was Bob Iger’s choice to pick Bob Chapek. He is his handpicked successor,” says Horn, the producer and outgoing Studios head. “Bob Iger has been working with him for decades and I think he chose wisely. I think the most important criterion in selection of a leader of the Walt Disney Company is character and I think this guy is of good character.” Horn then adds, “He’s not Bob Iger. Bob Iger’s an extremely tough act to follow.” 
A former Disney executive speculates that Iger chose Chapek because Mayer was too similar to himself. “In some ways Iger wanted someone who was different, so there was never confusion between the Iger Era and the Next Era.”
Iger left a much stronger company than he inherited, thanks to a series of acquisitions: $7.4bn for Pixar in 2006, $4bn each for Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm over the next six years. His 2019 deal to buy Fox sealed his reputation as a master dealmaker. The result has been blockbusters such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Endgame, but also criticism that Disney’s franchise juggernauts have left less space for serious cinema. 
Iger also instilled a top-down culture. All major decisions flowed through him. His top lieutenants, several of whom will follow Iger out the door this year, approached their job with a singular priority: “make sure no shit falls on Bob’s lap”, as a senior colleague puts it.
The question is whether Chapek will preserve that dynamic. “Is this the way [Chapek] will do it as well or is there going to be more operational independence? Initially people thought it would be the latter, but he seems to have continued the process of the former,” the same colleague says.

		 a virtual reality space where users can interact that has been much discussed since Facebook announced it was reorienting itself around the concept and rebranding as Meta. “The PC was the first wave in the digital revolution, mobile was number two and the metaverse is the third,” explains Chapek. 
To drive this message home, Chapek convened about 25 leaders from around the company — including “storytellers, creatives, technologists, imagineers and commercial people” — on November 16 to discuss the possibility of a Disney metaverse. “This is a pivotal point in the company’s storytelling history,” he says. The meeting was held in old-fashioned reality, with a few participants dialling in via video chat.
Chapek sees himself as a disrupter and wants the metaverse meetings to create “connective tissue” between Disney’s various micro-kingdoms. He wants them to be loose and open. “Given how broad the metaverse will be, we want people to go wild and dream,” he says. “We’re in the dreaming phase.”
Chapek has never been a creature of Hollywood, leaving the mansions of Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Brentwood to the air-kiss set while choosing to raise his family outside LA. He has maintained his Midwestern reserve, keeping his personal life private and avoiding — or at least not actively seeking — the limelight. Associates say he has had little time for Hollywood’s glad-handing.
His low profile stands in contrast not only with the outgoing Iger but with Discovery chief executive David Zaslav, who will take over WarnerMedia in mid-2022 once its $43bn deal with AT&T closes. With its broad offerings and original series, Warner’s HBO Max is a serious competitor to Disney Plus. Zaslav hangs out with Bono, Oprah Winfrey and David Geffen, and has been assiduously courting talent in Los Angeles, where he has bought the Beverly Hills home of sainted Hollywood producer Robert Evans. 
But when it comes to relationships with talent, agents say Chapek is still an unknown quantity. “How much is he going to consider the needs of the artists?” asks one industry insider. “I think he would acknowledge how important talent is to [Disney Plus]. So how much can he consider the priorities of the artists? That’s very unknown.” 
Chapek is aware of such concerns. He says he’s started taking meetings, making the social rounds and going out for dinners two or three evenings a week since Covid-19 restrictions eased. “He was not terribly well known in the movie industry or the TV industry, but I think he’s clearly making himself available to have conversations with people,” adds the insider. 
Endeavor’s Emanuel says the hand-wringing over Chapek’s relationship with Hollywood is overdone. “Our interactions so far have been great,” he says. “The minute he got in, he called us. He’s taken care of our people financially, been generous in his accolades.” 
Chapek may have more of a chance to build ties with the creative community once Iger goes. After Chapek became CEO, Iger began giving him advice on running the creative side of the business, including inviting him to “script note” sessions with directors. Chapek says he is “more than prepared now to take the reins in the creative sense” thanks to Iger’s guidance. But he adds, “Most people forget I’ve spent almost two decades working at the movie studio. The players aren’t strangers to me.”
The post-Iger era is already beginning to take shape. A number of key members of his leadership team are following him out the door, including Horn, long-serving general counsel Alan Braverman and the formidable veteran communications chief Zenia Mucha, who will be replaced by former BP communications and advocacy head Geoff Morrell. Iger’s successor as chair is Susan Arnold, a 14-year veteran of the Disney board and former executive at Carlyle Group and Procter & Gamble. Like Chapek, she has a background in consumer products.
Chapek says the departing executives have left an “indelible mark” on the company, but his top priorities — Disney Plus, creating the Disney metaverse — require a new focus. “This evolution of our vision is going to be enabled and catalysed by fresh thinking.”

Nothing about this absurdly extravagant show, which revolves around a luxury real estate brokerage in Hollywood and is now entering its fourth series, should work. Because who, in this time of heightened anxiety, wants to ogle the lives of the mega-rich, with their flash cars, infinity pools and walk-in wardrobes barely distinguishable from the shop floor of Gucci? 
I do, as it turns out, and based on last year’s stratospheric viewing figures, chances are you do too. It might easily have been masterminded by an algorithm in the way it combines essential elements of popular reality shows such as Real Housewives, Love Island and almost every high-end property series from the last 15 years. For each new house listing, there are swirling panoramic shots, interior tours edited into miniature pop videos, plus a calculation of the realtor commission which can reach six figures for a single sale. 
Then there are the realtors themselves: twin bosses Jason and Brett Oppenheim and their phalanx of agents who lunch, laugh, cry and gossip, and who would each impale their co-workers with a diamond-encrusted stiletto if it meant landing that $75m listing. Among them is Mary, a single mother so dedicated to her job that she sold the venue where she got married on the morning of her wedding day; Chrishell, a freshly divorced southern girl who in each episode reminds us of her wholesome, humble beginnings; and the villain of the piece, Christine Quinn.
Quinn is heavily pregnant at the start of the new series while still rocking spike heels, and is counting the days until her first post-pregnancy Botox appointment. In the last season, she made it snow at her wonderland-themed wedding; here she hosts a baby shower with a jungle motif, for which she hires real-life parrots and a sloth. 
Viewers are encouraged to gasp at the ruthlessness and exhibitionism on display, though Selling Sunset’s success lies in sufficiently adjusting our perspectives and getting us invested in the protagonists’ lives. Why did Christine choose not to invite Mary to her baby shower? What was the designer of that mansion thinking with that interior waterfall? Why does Jason’s multimillion dollar house look like a zhuzhed-up office complex? Yes, this is lowest-common-denominator TV but it is disgracefully, addictively entertaining.

https://www.ft.com/content/fd4cbbfa-d2dd-4260-b84c-8d54ada53d05,Anna Nicolaou,Netflix begins reporting viewer numbers for its biggest hits ,2021-11-16,20:00:08,"Netflix will begin regularly reporting viewership numbers for its top programmes and films, a major shift in strategy for the streaming company that has carefully guarded its data over the past decade. 
The company said it will report every week how many hours people spent watching its top 10 TV shows and movies, for both English and non-English titles, including Netflix originals and content licensed from third parties. 
In its first release of viewer numbers on Tuesday, Netflix said its subscribers last week spent 149m hours watching Red Notice, the action film starring Gal Gadot, making it the most popular piece of English-language content on the platform. 
Within television, the most-watched English-language show was the third season of Narcos: Mexico, drawing 50m hours of viewing. Squid Game was the most popular non-English language television show, racking up 43m hours of viewing during the week ending November 14.
“Nonsense. BS. Cherry Picked. Unaudited. We’ve had a lot of feedback about our metrics over the years,” said Pablo Perez De Rosso, vice-president of content strategy. “This is an important step forward for Netflix, the creators we work with and our members.”
Ever since Netflix leapt into original content with House of Cards in 2013, the company has largely kept hidden just how popular any given programme was. The company does not run advertisements so it does not need to report ratings to attract brands in the way that broadcast and cable television networks do. 
Previously, Netflix has reported how many subscribers watched the first two minutes of a programme. Traditional television ratings, typically provided by Nielsen, measure viewership during an average minute of a show. 
Box office sales and Nielsen television ratings — the traditional gauge of success in Hollywood — do not apply to Netflix, making it hard to determine what success means in streaming. Often, even the actors and producers involved would not know how popular their movie was, a source of frustration in the entertainment industry.

John Landgraf, chief executive of FX, a pay-TV channel owned by Disney, in 2019 criticised Netflix for its secretive practices. “When you take hundreds of at-bats, you’re going to get some singles, some doubles and even the occasional home run,” Landgraf said. “And failing to ever report a single strikeout undercuts an accurate perception of their batting average and misrepresents the scale of their hits.”
Netflix has been tiptoeing towards more transparency but has largely cherry-picked the numbers it releases to boast about its biggest hits. 
While that will change under the new reporting system, Netflix will fall short of the transparency of traditional TV and film performance. The company will report data only for its 10 most successful programmes, leaving out the disappointments. 
Netflix executives say traditional metrics, such as ratings, are not relevant in the streaming business model. The company’s goal is to lure new subscribers and stop existing ones from cancelling, not to make money from an individual programme. “Figuring out how best to measure success in streaming is hard, and there’s no one perfect metric,” said Perez De Rosso.
The streaming service’s peers such as Disney Plus and HBO Max have released even less viewership data than Netflix, which said it had hired EY to audit its metrics.

Netflix’s legal woesShould Netflix be treated as a distributor or a publisher? This is what lawyers continue to battle over as the streaming giant faces more defamation complaints than any major news outlet, according to the Hollywood Reporter.Who is suing Netflix for defamation, you ask? A surprisingly wide range of people. There are the Operation Varsity Blues parents, a cop from Making a Murderer, and even a former Soviet chess grandmaster for a remark in the Queen’s Gambit.
The company’s legal cases really started racking up when it started showing more true-crime documentaries, following the huge success of Making a Murderer in 2015, and it is being pursued by some legal heavyweights. 
Former Manhattan prosecutor Linda Fairstein has claimed that she was portrayed as racist in When They See Us, a drama about the Central Park Five case. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz also wants to take Netflix to court — for $80m. 
Collectively, the lawsuits raise a bigger question: Is Netflix responsible for any potential defamatory documentary or film it distributes? Or only the shows produced in-house? What about the ‘Netflix Originals’ that are exclusive to the platform but may involve other production companies? 
All the shows it has been sued for so far are exclusive to the platform, but have been either bought by Netflix or made in collaboration with other production companies. It is not always clear how involved Netflix is in the production process.
Historically, cinemas do not end up in court over films exhibited on their screens, nor does YouTube. But, as Netflix looks increasingly like a Hollywood studio, it is becoming harder for it to say it is just a platform.
This was the defence it offered in 2019 in its case about Making a Murderer. But the judge in the case, which is still ongoing, was not convinced, asking why Netflix had accepted awards for writing and editing the show. 
But Netflix also has not seemed keen to shield itself behind Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the US, which provides immunity for internet platforms with respect to third-party content. Instead, it has left the Internet Association, one of Big Tech’s main lobbying groups, and instead joined the Motion Picture Association of America, which has called on Big Tech to take more responsibility for the content on their sites. 
Perhaps streaming platforms will soon be held to the same standards as traditional broadcasters, who can be sued for defamation, including in programmes made by external production companies they air. 
So far, Netflix is the only major streaming company being sued for defamation and it has not lost a case yet, but Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Disney Plus and others will be watching closely.

A unit of information stored as a token on a blockchain, usually an ethereum blockchain. However, it is not fungible — meaning it cannot be interchanged with another token. That makes the token unique and turns its blockchain into a digital form of provenance. It can only have one owner. Some artists and sellers of collectible memorabilia have begun experimenting with selling NFTs. But owning the token only proves that someone has ownership of the “original” work, and does not necessarily include its copyright or its intellectual property rights.

https://www.ft.com/content/55b0d438-84cf-429e-b017-34208f77bdd7,Christopher Grimes,How Netflix became ‘Hateflix’ in the eyes of trans activists ,2021-10-21,04:00:01,"As dozens of Netflix employees stopped working and poured into the plaza in front of one of the company’s Los Angeles offices on Wednesday, they were greeted by trans activists who had turned up to show solidarity with the walkout. 
Holding placards reading “Hate isn’t funny”, “Black Trans Lives Matter” and “Hateflix”, the activists condemned Netflix for carrying programming they said could encourage discrimination or even violence against members of their community. 
Not everyone agreed with their cause. “I think Dave is funny!” yelled a man passing by on the sidewalk. The Dave in question was comedian Dave Chappelle, whose Netflix comedy special The Closer has sparked a culture war inside the world’s largest streaming company. 
Chappelle’s mocking references to transgender people — and the ham-fisted reaction from senior Netflix executives to the resulting criticism — has resulted in one of the worst public relations crises in the company’s history. 
The protesters said they were not demanding that the Chappelle special be removed from the streaming platform. Instead, they are calling for Netflix to invest as much money in “trans and non-binary content” as it does in “transphobic content”. They also want the company to recruit more trans people, especially those of colour, to senior positions. 
“This is not about the [Chappelle] special,” said B Pagels-Minor, a former manager at Netflix who was fired this month for allegedly leaking data about the Chappelle show. “This is about having parity in content, making sure that less harmful content is created.” 
Netflix has defined itself with a radical “no rules” corporate culture, extolling the importance of both creative freedom and progressive values. But now those two ideals are crashing into one another. 
The company has for years offered unlimited vacation and a full year of paid parental leave, rarities in corporate America. In 2019, when Republicans were pushing forward an anti-abortion law in Georgia, no large company spoke out until Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive at Netflix, warned that the streaming group would “rethink our entire investment in” the state if the legislation were to take effect. 
On screen Netflix also blazed a trail, pushing forward more diverse voices than typically seen on broadcast television, and experimenting with new genres that might once have been deemed too niche. Orange is the New Black, one of Netflix’s earliest hits, broke new ground for transgender representation on screen, with Laverne Cox becoming the first transgender person to win an Emmy for her role in the series. 
However, Netflix’s rise also relied on the notion of letting creatives roam. In a now famous slide deck about Netflix’s culture — which Facebook chief Sheryl Sandberg called possibly “the most important document ever to come out of [Silicon] Valley” — co-chief executive Reed Hastings extolled the virtues of freedom over bureaucracy. 
This proved useful to Netflix’s business interests. As a newcomer in Hollywood, it offered higher pay and more artistic freedom to top talent, helping lure them away from more established studios. Comedian Tina Fey has said that “you have to be a little more polite” on broadcast television, while on Netflix “you can get into more dangerous topics”. 
But it is this very attitude that has proved so problematic for Sarandos, who has spent weeks publicly defending Chappelle — among the most successful comedians of the past few decades — to his own disgruntled employees. 
Netflix has gone through previous controversies over its programming, once removing a scene from an episode of 13 Reasons Why after health experts linked it to an uptick in suicides. But none have incited this level of public unrest from staff, who have taken to social media, crashed senior-level meetings and leaked sensitive documents. Three employees have been suspended during the saga, in addition to Pagels-Minor’s dismissal. 
In a statement, Netflix said it respected the decision “of any employee who chooses to walk out” for the protest on Wednesday and admitted it had “much more work to do both within Netflix and in our content”.

Netflix faces a similar dilemma to other tech companies, such as YouTube and Spotify, as they toe the line between controversial content and commercial interests. 
Spotify has faced internal blowback over the company’s association with Joe Rogan, its biggest podcast star who, in an episode on Spotify this year, encouraged young people to not receive the Covid-19 vaccine. 
Spotify paid more than $100m to bring Rogan to Spotify exclusively. When asked last year about Rogan’s decision to invite Alex Jones, the far-right founder of InfoWars, on to his podcast, chief executive Daniel Ek told the Financial Times “we want creators to create” and that the company was “not looking to play a role in what they should say”. 
Google-owned YouTube has suffered through such controversies for years, as its stars often gain large followings by pushing the envelope with their videos. YouTube in 2017 cancelled a series with its highest-earning star PewDiePie after the Swedish video blogger posted a series of videos containing anti-Semitic comments. 
But while YouTube and Spotify can argue that they are simply “platforms” and thereby not responsible for the content on their sites, Netflix has been actively producing TV shows for the better part of a decade, building the largest studio in Hollywood where Sarandos reigns as the new kingmaker. 
While still defending the comedy special, even Sarandos concedes he “screwed up” the internal communications. He told reporters this week that his emails to staff, in which he had defended Chappelle on the premise of the comedian’s popularity, had “lacked humanity”. 
That communications strategy rested on the shoulders of Netflix PR chief Rachel Whetstone, a British executive who previously worked at Conservative central office in London alongside the likes of George Osborne. She is married to Steve Hilton, a former top adviser to David Cameron who fell out with the UK prime minister over Brexit.
“You can’t be dictated by backlash, but there is a delicate balance,” said a former Netflix executive, who now works in communications for another media group. “This isn’t the old playbook any more. There’s a way to let people have their say, blow off steam and then course-correct over time.”

Over the past few weeks the streaming group has suffered the most high-profile internal backlash in its history after employees spoke out against allegedly transphobic comments made by comedian Dave Chappelle in a Netflix special titled The Closer. 
Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive of Netflix, last week emailed roughly 150 senior staff defending the segment, pointing to the importance of Chappelle to the company. “Chappelle is one of the most popular stand-up comedians today, and we have a long standing deal with him,” he said.
Chappelle’s hour-long special made frequent mocking references to transgender people and other members of the LGBT+ community. He defended the position of those who argue that a person’s sex is assigned at birth and cannot be altered, while comparing trans identities to the wearing of blackface. “I’m Team Terf,” Chappelle said, a reference to so-called “trans-exclusionary radical feminists”.
Netflix quickly faced blowback from its own employees in addition to human rights organisations, activists and some of its top talent. Comedian Hannah Gadsby called Netflix an “amoral algorithm cult”, while Dear White People showrunner Jaclyn Moore said she was “done” with the company. 
A former senior Netflix executive said the crisis was part of the “ongoing story of Silicon Valley versus Hollywood”, as Netflix has shaken up the television and film business with its emphasis on data and algorithms.
“This is the robots versus creative, sensitive people,” said the executive. “Netflix tries to codify everything. Reed [Hastings, co-founder] sets extremely high ideals, and can you really live up to all those ideals as you keep growing?”
The company’s employees were planning a virtual work stoppage on Wednesday, while activists rallied outside a Netflix building on Vine Street in Los Angeles, with a list of demands for the company. 
As tensions have swelled, Netflix’s employees have leaked to the press both the chief executive’s internal memos and sensitive financial information — an unprecedented rebellion against a company that has prided itself on progressive values and creative freedom.
“Netflix does this under this tech banner of ‘this is about freedom of information and we’re not going to stand in the way of artists’,” said another former executive. “It has almost been a competitive edge to cable television, because [streaming] wasn’t held to the same standards.”
Hastings has made transparency a core part of the company’s unconventional corporate culture, sharing financial information and company salaries widely. The strategy was previously validated by loyalty among staff. “The financial world sees this as reckless. But the information has never been leaked,” Hastings wrote in a book released last year.
But employees in the past week have shared sensitive information about how Netflix assigns a dollar value to a television show, a question that has mystified Wall Street over the years. Netflix spent $24m to make Chappelle’s The Closer, more than the $22m it cost to make the Korean TV series Squid Game, which went on to far greater viewership, according to Bloomberg figures that were confirmed by the Financial Times. Netflix last Friday said it had fired an employee for leaking documents to the media.
Netflix in 2018 hired British public relations executive Rachel Whetstone to lead its global communications. In the past month, senior communications executives in the US and the UK have exited the company. 
The backlash is the first reputational blow in some time for Netflix, which has attracted some of Hollywood’s most talented executives and creatives with the promise of enormous paycheques and creative freedom. Some workers’ salaries were doubled or tripled from their previous employment; others were given raises in the hundreds of thousands of dollars overnight.
Another former executive described the crisis as “inevitable”.
“What has kept this from happening before is that they pay everyone so much,” said the former employee. “You’d be hard-pressed to find a salary under $100,000 at Netflix. I’ve never seen leaks like this, but now the floodgates are a little open.”
Netflix is unlikely to face near-term financial consequences over the matter. Its stock has climbed more than 20 per cent in the past two months as investors cheered the success of Squid Game, which has become the group’s most popular show ever. Netflix doubled its net new subscribers in the third quarter to 4.4m, exceeding forecasts.
However, the controversy has put pressure on Sarandos, Netflix’s most prominent face in Hollywood, who last Wednesday sent a second internal memo reaffirming his stance on Chappelle. 
“Adults can watch violence, assault and abuse — or enjoy shocking stand-up comedy — without it causing them to harm others,” he said. “While some employees disagree, we have a strong belief that content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.”
Critics were quick to point out that 44 transgender Americans were murdered last year, according to the Human Rights Campaign, the highest since the group started tracking in 2013. 
Late on Tuesday night ahead of the walkout, Sarandos tried to offer a mea culpa, stating that he had “screwed up” with internal communications, but continuing to defend the Chappelle programme.
“This group of employees felt a little betrayed because we’ve created such a great place to work that they forgot that sometimes these challenges will come up,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. 
But the comments appeared to stoke the fire further. “We didn’t forget shit,” Terra Field, a transgender Netflix engineer who was suspended last week for crashing a virtual company meeting uninvited, posted on Twitter. “Stop patronising us.”

The hit South Korean drama, released in September, has been the video streaming service’s biggest-ever series launch, reaching more than 142m viewers globally. Netflix projected it would add 8.5m subscribers in the fourth quarter of this year, above the 8.33m expected by Wall Street, and reach 18.4m new viewers for the year. 
Most new subscriber growth came outside the US, with the Asia-Pacific region contributing 2.2m in paid net new subscribers. 
Netflix’s growth slowed in the first half of the year, as Covid-19 related production delays dented the number of new shows on offer. Competition from studio-owned video streaming services also picked up, with Disney Plus, HBO Max and others launching aggressive campaigns to capture the attention of locked-down viewers. 
But Netflix has regained momentum with Squid Game, a surprise hit released on September 17 that the company says has become its biggest TV show. It said demand for Squid Game merchandise was high and it had started shipping consumer products to retailers.
Netflix has been criticised for mishandling the controversy that followed the third-quarter release of its latest stand-up special by the comedian Dave Chappelle, The Closer. Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive, has stood by the show, which has been condemned as transphobic. Some Netflix employees are threatening to walk out on Wednesday in protest. 
Netflix said it expected to see the “positive effect of a stronger slate” of programming in the second half of the year, including the big-budget action film Red Notice, starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, and Don’t Look Up, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence and other A-listers.
“We’re in uncharted territory,” said Reed Hastings, co-chief executive. “We have so much content coming [in the fourth quarter], like we’ve never had.”
Recommended
The company said it had started testing its nascent games business, which it expanded in the third quarter with the acquisition of the game producer Night School Studio.
Company officials said the push into gaming was very early, but the goal was to offer a service without the unpopular features on other platforms such as ads and in-game monetisation. 
Hastings said he hoped the company would soon be able to create a “whole experience”, where a hit show such as Squid Game could spin off a successful consumer product offering and a video game. 
“A company like Disney is ahead of us in putting the whole experience together,” he said. “In the next three to five years we want to catch up and maybe pass them on the all-round experience.” 
Without further Covid disruptions, Netflix said it expected to release more original programming in 2022 than it had this year. In a research note, analysts at Morgan Stanley projected the company would have better subscriber growth next year, with net additions of roughly 25m.
Shares in Netflix, which have underperformed the broader market so far this year, fell 1 per cent in after-hours trading.

Fewer still would have imagined that the flood of network traffic the show attracted would set the stage for higher internet bills and video subscription fees around the world.
More than 100m viewers, says Netflix, watched the dystopian show in which a group of indebted people, including a fugitive banker and gambling addict, battle it out for a $38m jackpot by playing children’s playground games. 
But this success has also resulted in South Korea’s SK Broadband suing Netflix to cover the cost of the surge in network traffic. Should streaming groups pay a congestion charge for hit shows?
SK Broadband, wholly owned by South Korea’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom, thinks they should. The company says the traffic that Netflix generates on its network has surged to 1.2tn bits of data processed per second as of September, the month of Squid Game’s release, a 24-fold increase over three years. It has had to upgrade its network twice to accommodate the traffic surge caused by the show.Hits such as Squid Game have made Netflix the most successful streaming service in South Korea, where local earnings more than doubled in the year to 2020. Subscriptions increased almost two-thirds in the month of August alone, according to industry data provider WiseApp.Local internet speeds have facilitated the expansion. South Korea has the fastest internet of a major market at 450 Mbps in 5G median download speeds, 11 times faster than the US, according to data analysis company Speedcheck. Heavy government spending over the past decade has created the infrastructure necessary to achieve this. Policies also ban broadband companies from charging high rates for internet access.Instead, local laws require the heaviest users — companies and content providers that use more than 1 per cent of total network traffic and have more than 1m users — to pay internet fees to bear a share of the maintenance costs incurred by broadband providers.Netflix accounted for almost 5 per cent of daily internet traffic in the fourth quarter and had more than 1.7m paid subscribers, according to official data. SK Broadband’s lawsuit claims Netflix has not paid correct network usage fees it is due for the past three years.Netflix sees those fees as contrary to its stance on net neutrality, which requires internet service providers to treat all content on their networks equally. It has argued that SK Broadband is calling for double billing, with subscribers paying for an internet connection via their Netflix subscription as well as a direct fee for internet service. It took its own legal action against SK Broadband over the charges last year.A district court dismissed Netflix’s claim in June and ruled it must pay outstanding fees to SK Broadband. Netflix has appealed against the ruling. If it wins, it could open the door for all companies in South Korea, both local and international, that use more than their bandwidth limit, to challenge their own fees. 
A bigger issue is that streaming video services are becoming more mainstream around the globe. Video streaming accounted for 71 per cent of all downstream US internet usage in 2020, according to Comcast and about two-thirds of total global traffic. Combined with the boom in video conferencing usage and data intensive technologies such as automated driving, that places a burden on the fixed capacity of internet providers.On the flipside, net neutrality means internet providers have little incentive to invest in costly upgrades and capacity increases.
Viewers risk being caught in the crossfire. Overwhelmed networks do not only mean lower quality movie streams but unreliable internet and communication channels in general. If profit margins further deteriorate, internet providers will be forced to adopt hard limits on data for users.Should Netflix lose its case against SK Broadband, the estimated fees of $84m are unlikely to leave a dent in its
	bottom line.

		 But it opens the door for global internet providers to consider charging streaming companies for their heavy bandwidth loads. 
This could mean a rise in prices for everyone as upgrade costs are spread across subscribers as a whole and not just corporations. Subscription costs of video streaming services could rise accordingly. Both SK Broadband’s lawsuit and Netflix’s hearing are scheduled for December. These are the showdowns viewers should watch after Squid Game.

https://www.ft.com/content/fbe30966-fb29-4694-b69d-816d2c632544,Anna Nicolaou,Netflix says its programming is back on pace after pandemic slowdown,2021-10-10,10:00:22,"Netflix is on track to deliver a “steady pace” of programming up to the end of 2022, says the video streamer’s television chief, after production delays due to the pandemic left the company lighter than expected on shows earlier this year. 
“Now we are on a steady pace for the next couple of years,” said Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s global head of television.
“Unless something happens [with the pandemic], but right now we’re in a steady state all through 2022 in terms of what is being delivered . . . All these [shows] are in post [production] and finishing shooting.”
A steady stream of popular TV shows and movies has proved critical to Netflix’s subscriber growth, and thereby its stock price. Netflix suffered a sharp slowdown in subscriber additions in the first half of 2021, which management blamed on a lighter offering of content due to Covid-19 production delays.
Bajaria also brushed off concerns about a possible strike among Hollywood crew workers, who say they do not earn a living wage even as technology companies reap the benefits of the streaming boom. Some 60,000 behind-the-scenes workers, such as camera operators and hair stylists, this week voted in favour of a strike, which would be the first such stoppage since 1945 and halt production across the US.
“A strike in any place when it comes to production, we keep an eye on,” Bajaria said. “But it seems that everyone is really engaged on both sides in finding a solution”. 
Netflix executives had predicted that growth would heat up in the second half of this year, with the return of shows such as Sex Education. The company has had recent successes with hits such as Squid Game, The Witcher and Seinfeld, as it kicks off a busier release schedule up to the end of the year.

Wall Street has noticed, sending Netflix’s shares to an all-time high this week as investors anticipate better subscriber numbers due to the stronger programme offering. 
The dystopian South Korean drama series Squid Game has become the most popular Netflix show in the US — a first for a Korean title — and chief executive Ted Sarandos said it could become the company’s biggest show of all time. 
“We always knew [Squid Game] would be a big title in Korea and south-east Asia,” Bajaria said. However, it would have been “hard to imagine what it became, because we had never seen that before”.
The Asia-Pacific region made up two-thirds of Netflix’s new subscribers in the most recent quarter, making it an important region as sign-ups in the US have ground to a halt. Netflix is set to spend $500m on films and TV shows in South Korea this year.

Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday
Squid Game has become the first series to top charts in all 83 countries where Netflix streams. Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive of the US streaming business, says the dystopian South Korean drama may be its biggest show ever. The surge raises a broader question: should streaming groups pay a congestion charge for hit shows, rather as motorists do for driving on crowded streets?
Squid Game had the feelbad addictiveness of the movie Parasite and the zombie series Kingdom. These were also products of South Korea’s growing entertainment industry and featured heavy subtexts about disparities of wealth and power.
The new show features a desperate group of 456 indebted people, including a gambling addict, a fugitive banker and a North Korean refugee. They sign up to participate in a contest for a $38m jackpot by playing six children’s playground games. The losers die.
The series has meant a jackpot for Netflix and for local production companies. It has also pushed older, forgotten Korean dramas to the top of Netflix ranks. Growing demand for content is pushing up licensing fees. Local studios already boast fat production margins of about 40 per cent.
Squid Game has sparked a dispute over the burden that hit shows place on the internet. Local provider SK Broadband has started legal action against Netflix, in a rare showdown between a video-streaming platform and a broadband company.
Hits such as Squid Game and Kingdom have made Netflix the most successful streaming service in South Korea, where its earnings more than doubled in the year to 2020. August data show Netflix revenues rose 80 per cent as subscriptions increased almost two-thirds, according to industry data provider WiseApp.
On the flipside, that means traffic that Netflix generates on its network has increased 24-fold over the past three years, according to SK Broadband, increasing pressure for expensive network upgrades.
Local laws require content companies with more than 1m users and 1 per cent of total traffic to bear a share of the maintenance costs incurred by broadband providers. Netflix accounted for almost 5 per cent of daily internet traffic in the fourth quarter.
Netflix sees those fees as contrary to its stance on net neutrality. This would require internet service providers to treat all content on their networks equally. It has argued that SK Broadband is calling for double billing, with subscribers paying for an internet connection via their Netflix subscription as well as a direct fee. Last year, it took its own legal action against SK Broadband over charges.
SK Broadband argues Netflix has not been paying network usage fees it is due. Domestic streaming service companies as well as all companies, local and international, that use more than their bandwidth limit, including Amazon, Apple and Facebook, have been paying the fees.
In the US, Netflix historically paid broadband providers for faster speeds. In recent years it says it has switched to a model where it spends money on extra server capacity which it supplies to broadband providers at times of high demand.
The first round did not go well for Netflix. The district court ruled against the company. Its appeal against the ruling is coming up in December. 
As it pushes for long-term studio contracts in South Korea, with about $500m earmarked for Korean content this year, expect disputes over network usage fees to become increasingly acrimonious.
For SK Broadband, wholly owned by the largest local mobile carrier SK Telecom, a legal ruling in its favour would mean a steady stream of fees from Netflix. SK Telecom’s gross margins have been dropping, down more than a quarter in the year to June from 98 per cent in 2018. 
Shares of Netflix are up a tenth since the release of Squid Game. If it loses the latest lawsuit, it will have to pay an estimated $84m in network usage fees. The fine will barely leave a scratch, at less than 1 per cent of $25bn in sales it made last year.
But it would set a global example for similar disputes over net neutrality. One day, it could be the norm for broadband providers to levy charges on fast-growing video-streaming companies. The subscription costs of consumers would rise accordingly.
This article has been amended since publication to reflect Netflix’s switch from direct payments to broadband providers for capacity to expenditure on servers to handle extra demand.

Jamie Spears, Britney’s father, has legally controlled her person and finances for the past 13 years. We see what a charmer he is in a brief clip of him calling a journalist a “dumb fuck”. 
While a cache of leaked documents provides much of the meat for Britney vs Spears, which follows last year’s Framing Britney, some of the most telling interviews here are those with people who don’t want to speak. Felicia Culotta, Spears’ former personal assistant, says “Sorry!” with indecent frequency. “I don’t wanna talk about her daddy.” “I don’t wanna fight with them, it’s just not worth it for me.” “I will not touch that one.” Sorree!
The doctor who conducted the initial medical evaluation of Spears — at least according to some leaked documents — is too wily to be caught out. Was he aware of Britney Spears’ music before he saw her? “I’m not going to acknowledge that I’ve ever met her.” He declines to confirm his signature. “Show me my signed declaration.” A specialist in geriatric psychiatry, he points out that all his patient evaluations are confidential, and that’s fair enough. 
Geriatric, you say? Within the document dump, Carr and Rolling Stone journalist Jenny Eliscu spotted the phrase “orders related to dementia placement” on the conservatorship application — a most unusual box to tick for an active 26-year-old. Attorney Tony Chicotel has overseen dozens of conservatees and “not one of them has ever had a job”. The legal requirement for a conservatorship, tantamount to “a civil death” according to some, is very high. As he explains it, “You need to be unable to meet your needs for food, clothing, health, shelter.” Strange that a young woman whose 2013-17 Las Vegas residency spanned 248 high-energy performances and netted $137.7m should be considered in that category. 
One of the most poignant aspects of the testimony here is the way an isolated Britney would repeatedly reach out for help to men she’d only just met. After chatting to her one night in a bar, Sam Lutfi got an unexpected call: “I need your help.” As her manager, he became the eventual pretext for the protection order or, as he puts it, the scapegoat. Paparazzo Adnan Ghalib and cinematographer Andrew Gallery also report the star begging for their aid. 
The legal wrangling is Dickensian in its torturous extent and circularity, while the overall plot is positively Shakespearean, a question of shifting interpretation, shadowy factors and bitterly opposing views. At the end is the customary black screen of denials and no comments. The story rumbles on and the case continues.

The US company’s purchase of the Roald Dahl Story Company, announced on Tuesday, is its latest effort to consolidate its position as the world’s most popular streaming service by expanding its content library. Netflix has 209m subscribers, but faces intensifying competition from the likes of Amazon, Disney and HBO and a number of alternatives.
Other companies that already have arrangements with Roald Dahl’s estate — Penguin Random House, for instance, has a book publishing deal — will retain any rights they have acquired.
Titles that have already been adapted for the big screen include The Witches, The BFG and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, of which there have been two film iterations. Warner Brothers is making Wonka, about how the chocolate entrepreneur encountered the Oompa-Loompas in his early years.
However, Netflix will become the “underlying” rights holder in a deal that people familiar with the matter said was worth more than £500m. Sky News first reported the size of the transaction. Both parties declined to comment on the deal value.
The purchase will give Netflix scope to develop the characters and stories in other formats, wider rights for animations, television and merchandise where they are not already controlled by other parties, and a share of the revenues in some cases where the rights have already been handed over.
Netflix’s acquisition of the company, which is owned by Dahl’s family and employees, marks a considerable deepening of its existing links with his estate.
Recommended
The California-based group struck a deal three years ago to make animated series of Charlie, among other titles by the British author. 
“These projects opened our eyes to a much more ambitious venture,” Netflix said in a statement, promising a “unique universe across animated and live action films and TV, publishing, games, immersive experiences, live theatre, consumer products and more”.
Born in 1916 in Wales to Norwegian parents, Dahl dreamt up what became some of the most loved characters in children’s fiction including the BFG, Willy Wonka and Fantastic Mr Fox. His books have sold more than 300m copies.
The sale comes less than a year after the Roald Dahl Story Company apologised for anti-Semitic comments made by the author, who died in 1990. 
A “significant part” of the proceeds would be used to establish a charitable trust that would focus on “children’s health, anti-hate and anti-racism”. Staff would also “benefit financially” from the sale.
The company said it would operate as an “autonomous unit” within Netflix.

Nordic Entertainment Group, the Swedish owner of Viaplay, announced on Wednesday that it would be in 16 countries by 2023, adding Austria and Switzerland to the likes of the US, Netherlands, Poland and the Baltics.
It has extensive sporting rights in most of its existing markets, including the English Premier League and Bundesliga football, Formula 1 motor racing, and darts in the Netherlands. But the group will make a lower-cost entry into the UK and Germany, positioning itself as a niche Nordic drama player with the promise of a possible sports offering later on.
“We are the non-US streaming challenger and there are not many like us. We are in a quite unique position. We are gradually building things up,” Anders Jensen, chief executive, told the Financial Times.
US services such as Amazon Prime and Disney Plus dominate streaming in Europe, with national broadcasters lagging well behind, and few cross-border players. Nent is expanding rapidly from its Nordic base where it is second behind Netflix in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. 
It currently has 3.3m subscribers but with ambitions to have more than 12m by the end of 2025. Viaplay is due to launch in the US in December and in the Netherlands at the start of next year.
The UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Canada will follow in early 2023, using the proceeds of SKr4.4bn ($500m) capital raising this year. Norway’s $1.4tn oil fund is the group’s largest
	shareholder.

Jensen said Nent was open to entering partnerships with local players such as Britbox, the online streaming service jointly owned by the BBC and ITV. One possible model would be that the local partner would have the first opportunity to show a television series while Viaplay would get the second, and both could market it internationally in different countries, Jensen added.
Nent is building clusters of content based on language, with an English one centred on the US and UK, and a German one. It could enter more countries before 2025, Jensen stressed, especially without a sports offering initially, by leveraging its technology platform across markets.
“We’re not doing sports from the beginning for several reasons. One is timing and availability of rights. Investing in sports in the UK and Germany is pretty expensive,” Jensen added.
Recommended
One possibility could be to concentrate on niche sports. About 800,000 people in the Netherlands watched a darts tournament last weekend and Viaplay has secured the rights for that, Formula 1 and Premier League football in the country.
Nent believes it will benefit from significant operational leverage as much of its costs are already covered. Revenues should grow by about 20 per cent per year up to 2025, while profit margins in the Nordics should reach 15 per cent and its international operations should break even by then, before becoming more profitable than the Nordics, according to Jensen.
The company had sales of SKr12bn ($1.4bn) and an operating profit of Skr3.2bn last year.
“The question I get is how do we compete with these giants? You have to do it market by market. If you compare us in the Nordics, we are not so far away. We have carved out a niche for ourselves from which we can grow in a sustainable way,” Jensen said.

Netflix’s fourth season of The Crown won the Emmy for best drama, a first for the streaming pioneer. The show dominated in the acting categories, with wins for Olivia Colman, who plays Queen Elizabeth, and Josh O’Connor, who portrays Prince Charles.
Gillian Anderson won best supporting actress in a drama series for her portrayal of British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, while Tobias Menzies won best supporting actor in a drama series for his turn as Prince Philip. 
The Crown won seven awards in total while Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit won two prizes, including best limited series.
Ted Lasso, a feel-good programme about an American who is hired to coach a British football team, won best comedy series, a big achievement for Apple’s streaming service, which launched only two years ago. Jason Sudeikis, the show’s star, won the top award for comedy acting. 
A pandemic hit that was promoted with the slogan “Kindness makes a comeback”, Ted Lasso has been Apple’s first bona fide success. The company earmarked more than $6bn in 2019 for its streaming effort, a war chest that allowed it to lure top talent. 
The competition may become even fiercer as the streaming industry enters what analysts have dubbed a “land grab” phase, following recent launches of Disney, Paramount+, HBO Max and others. 
This was the second Emmy ceremony disrupted by Covid-19. Worries about the Delta variant of coronavirus forced organisers to move the ceremony to an outdoor tent in downtown Los Angeles. 
While most of the usual glitzy parties were scrapped, stars still posed outside on the red carpet. About 500 people attended the ceremony, the Associated Press estimated.

Who are those guys?” Butch complains.
The rise of Netflix and other US streaming platforms such as Disney Plus and HBO Max is scaring both film studios and the world’s television broadcasters in much the same fashion. Instead of observing old niceties and ways of doing business, the streamers are disrupting the fun.
It is starting to get on Hollywood’s nerves. Jim Gianopulos was ousted this week as head of Paramount Pictures by its owner ViacomCBS, which wants to place more films on its streaming service Paramount Plus. The Oscar-winning director Christopher Nolan is moving to Universal, having lambasted WarnerMedia for favouring its platform HBO Max during the pandemic.
The streamers are also spending large amounts in other countries. Netflix this week signed a partnership deal with Anna Winger, the Berlin-based writer and producer behind the series Deutschland 83 and Unorthodox. “The success around the world of German content is really incredible,” Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said in Berlin.
The notion of German language series subtitled or dubbed in English (and other languages) attracting a global following would have been improbable not long ago, but it is no longer alien. Lupin, a French language drama starring Omar Sy, was Netflix’s most watched series in the first quarter of this year.
There is more at stake for Netflix than supplementing its core US audience with international viewers, in the Hollywood style. Netflix now has 209m subscribers, but the total fell slightly in the US and Canada in the second quarter of this year, as new streaming platforms expanded. The company could soon have more customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa than at home.
In many ways, it is the best of times for the global television viewer. What is known as Peak TV in the US — the flood of new investment into high quality dramas and documentaries — is still ascending in other countries. Disney is this year expected to spend $30bn, and Netflix $17bn, on media content such as films and television series.
That is narrowing the old gap in production values and sophistication between top US cable dramas, such as The Sopranos and The Wire, and the cheaper fare on European and Asian television. The characters speak other languages and the settings are different, but many of the new global dramas attain a similar level of quality.
But it squeezes something else — the experience of viewing something utterly distinctive, which could only have been conjured up in one place. That was my sensation when viewing Lupin. It was very entertaining and sophisticated but despite its French mise-en-scène, it felt oddly American.
A Greek tragedy would remain a Greek tragedy even if it were set in Spain, and it is impossible to shed Englishness from Shakespeare plays despite their universal appeal. Changing location is easy, but the sensibility and narrative tradition are deeply embedded. There is a similar immutability in Hollywood films, and the narrative arcs and twists of US television.

		 A series that attracts a devoted audience solely in its home country helps to build subscribers there and serves a purpose. But the streamers are always hunting for what Greg Peters, Netflix’s chief operating officer, calls “leverage against that local investment” — programmes that will travel.
“Some of them look like they’ve been cleverly generated by a streaming algorithm to maximise their target audience globally,” remarked John Whittingdale before he lost his job as broadcasting minister in a UK government reshuffle this week. National broadcasters such as the BBC, with its annual income of £5bn, face a well-financed onslaught.
In principle, this need not matter. Those broadcasters could carry on making what Whittingdale called “distinctively British” (or French, or German) programmes while the US streamers produce their alternative. Viewers are capable of watching and appreciating the variety — vive la différence, as a Lupin character might say.
But money talks, and Netflix and others have been luring some of the top creative talents. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is as British as anyone on screen, but the writer and actor is contracted to Amazon Studios rather than the BBC. The danger is of a talent drain that turns national markets into minor leagues.
The UK government now wants to insert a “distinctively British” content requirement into the responsibilities of public service broadcasters. Good luck with drafting that, and to any judge who has to rule on the question. Lupin may not feel fully French to me but I doubt whether anyone could disprove its identity in court.
It will be hard to throw the streaming platforms off their global trail, legally or financially. As Butch and the Kid found to their personal cost, tradition does not always protect you.

https://www.ft.com/content/dd5a1b8b-18e1-4750-a8e7-5d2da436b769,Danny Leigh,Worth on Netflix is equal parts philosophy and spreadsheets,2021-09-01,16:00:25,"Within days of 9/11, wheels were turning across US government. In one corner of Washington, war in Afghanistan was being hopefully plotted. In another, focus fell on the threat of lawsuits from the victims’ families, enough to bankrupt airlines and crater the American economy.
Now 20 years on, we have Worth. The title comes from a book written by the movie’s subject, attorney Kenneth Feinberg, played by Michael Keaton. What Is Life Worth?, it was called, charting his work as “special master” of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. But that same question had long been the speciality of Feinberg’s practice, expert in the haggle and maths of dispute resolution. It meant that when the fund was to be administered, he was the obvious choice for the job. (The only choice, in fact. No one else would touch it.)
That Worth (directed by Sara Colangelo) sees itself as not the average 9/11 drama is signalled by the casting of Keaton. He’s a film star whose spiky charisma you might not choose to share a lift with, and his Feinberg too is not without his own sharp edges. A star bureaucrat, he has a cheap haircut and drab suit with a pointed quality. Where others dazzle, a thick Massachusetts accent instead declares his eternal faith in what he calls the “num-bahs”. A data hound before it was fashionable, Feinberg sees calculus as the key to his task — a fair measure by which to put a price on human loss. Intriguing, no? A legal drama with no possible winner, equal parts philosophy and spreadsheets.
Of course, all that crumbles on the first meeting with the families. Sobs punctuate Feinberg’s address (slapstick clueless). Fury follows. The movie points up the raw ugliness of his original vision, tallying how many janitors might add up to a CEO. But as the campaign against the fund gathers pace, it becomes apparent that much is just the start. The insult is the whole Feinberg worldview, the search for the objective free of individual circumstance. What’s a special master to do?
The film finds the answer in the place movies have since A Christmas Carol. Cold rationality withers in the face of multiform human experience, the messy, essential stuff to which the movie is a tribute. Who could argue? Worth is too smart to ever really make Feinberg the bad guy, but the tools of his trade — dispassion and process — are not welcome here. Hm. As the string section plays, you may look back at the past 20 years and wonder if dispassion has been the real problem. Curious, too, that a film this hostile to formulas is brought to you by the algorithms of Netflix and its CEO, Reed Hastings — another son of Massachusetts with a liking for the num-bahs.

As the entertainment business has moved towards streaming rather than traditional television, subscriber growth has become the most important metric for Wall Street in deciding whether to buy or sell media stocks.
Netflix stock can be notably volatile in the days after earnings, depending on whether it added more or fewer subscribers than forecast.
According to the SEC complaint filed in federal court in Seattle on Wednesday, engineer Sung Mo Jun, while working for Netflix in 2016 and 2017, tipped off his brother and a friend with subscriber information. They then used it to trade ahead of Netflix earnings announcements.

Another former Netflix engineer, Jae Hyeon Bae, was also charged for leaking Netflix subscriber numbers to Mo Jun’s brother ahead of the company’s July 2019 earnings release. The company that quarter reported its first drop in US subscribers since 2011, wiping more than $15bn from Netflix’s market value — the worst decline in its stock price in three years. 
Erin Schneider, director of the SEC’s San Francisco office, said the group “engaged in a long-running, multimillion dollar scheme to profit from valuable, misappropriated company information”.

The SEC has charged the three former staffers with violating antifraud provisions. The charges would “hold each of the participants accountable”, said Schneider.

		 designed to be more cost effective than both companies going it alone, is also further evidence that rivals are collaborating as they challenge Netflix, Disney and Amazon’s Prime Video. Earlier this year, AT&T agreed to spin off and combine WarnerMedia with rival Discovery in a multibillion-dollar deal.
SkyShowtime involves an equal investment, of an undisclosed size, from ViacomCBS and Comcast, and would be controlled jointly, the companies said on Wednesday.
It is due to be launched next year, subject to regulatory approval, and should ultimately be available in 22 countries including Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, as well as in Nordic markets and much of central and eastern Europe.
Dana Strong, Sky’s chief executive, said it was a “milestone moment” for Sky. As a result of the launch, the brand will be present in 28 countries in Europe.
Comcast, which agreed to buy Sky in 2018, is using the company to expand in Europe. It is introducing NBCUniversal’s Peacock content on Sky’s services throughout the continent.
Julian Aquilina, TV specialist at Enders Analysis, said it also showed how Sky, which has traditionally focused on sport, was pivoting its strategy to becoming an “aggregator”, offering viewers content from a range of sources.
Recommended
Raffaele Annecchino, chief executive of ViacomCBS Networks International, said the service was “a huge opportunity to accelerate our market expansion” in Europe.
The latest tie-up with Comcast follows a deal that ViacomCBS announced this month to distribute its Paramount+ streaming service, which launched in the US, through Sky in the UK, Italy, and Germany.
Subscription pricing for customers has yet to be announced. Series and films to be offered to viewers have also yet to be confirmed, although Strong promised a “truly compelling line-up” of content.
The roster will include productions from Showtime, whose series include Dexter and Twin Peaks, and Sky Studios, which is behind Chernobyl and Gangs of London. The companies said the content would span genres, including drama, documentaries and children’s programming, as well as local content.

https://www.ft.com/content/7d84dfa0-c88a-4380-85a0-9e9db46124f5,Tim Bradshaw,Why Netflix is moving into gaming,2021-07-24,04:00:54,"For years, Netflix has watched as the world’s largest technology companies try to position themselves as the “Netflix of gaming” — and agonised about whether to join them. 
Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Sony have all rolled out video game streaming services that use sophisticated cloud technology to bring console-quality video games to any device, just like watching a Netflix show. 
“We talked about video games for several years, writing up the pros and cons of the timing of entry,” Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said this week. 
Hastings, who famously says he likes to make “as few decisions as possible”, has finally decided to push the start button on Netflix’s gaming business. After hiring a former Electronic Arts executive to run its interactive team, the video streaming company announced this week that games would soon be added to its mobile apps as part of customers’ existing subscriptions.
But rather than taking advantage of its streaming technology to go into competition with Google’s Stadia or Microsoft’s xCloud, Netflix’s strategy more closely resembles earlier efforts by Hollywood studios such as Walt Disney and Warner Bros to develop games based on franchises such as Batman, Lord of the Rings and Spider-Man.
“We are in the business of making these amazing worlds and great storylines and incredible characters” in its original movies and TV series, Greg Peters, Netflix’s chief product officer, told investors on this week’s earnings call. “And we know the fans of those stories want to go deeper.”
Viewers of blockbuster shows such as Stranger Things, Money Heist and Black Mirror might be excited by Netflix’s move into gaming but analysts and investors are more divided about the heavily indebted company’s new foray into a vast but intensely competitive part of the entertainment market.
Despite a carefully choreographed series of announcements about its expansions into retail, podcasts and gaming in the weeks leading up to its earnings report, investors have remained focused on the challenges facing its core business, as economies reopen and streaming competition intensifies.
Sign-ups in North America have ground to a halt in the past six months. From April to June, 430,000 people cancelled their Netflix subscriptions in the US and Canada. Over that same period, HBO Max added 2.4m subscribers, albeit from a much smaller base, while some believe Netflix is reaching saturation point in its largest markets.
After years of heady growth, “middle age appears to be setting in”, said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. Its shares have lost 5 per cent this year, while the benchmark

		gained 16 per cent.
As Netflix looks for new ways to retain its 209m paying subscribers, games could be one way to reduce churn, as Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, Comcast, Discovery and ViacomCBS all look to lure away its subscribers.
Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Netflix also appeared to be using games as a “shiny new object that might distract investors from what we perceive to be [its] slowing growth”.
“Disney tried and failed to start up a games division three times” in the last 20 years, Pachter added. “Very few movies make it as games . . . I don’t see any [Netflix] properties except Stranger Things that would make a good game. Bridgerton? Ozark? Murder Mystery? Puhleeeez.”
Others have struck a more optimistic tone.
Netflix does at least have its own entertainment properties to build on as it pushes into games, said Piers Harding-Rolls, research director of games at Ampere Analysis, unlike Google or Apple.
Compared with the tens of millions of dollars needed to create a blockbuster console game, the stakes are rather lower in mobile gaming, where Netflix has said it plans to focus. Harding-Rolls estimates that a 5-10 per cent increase to its $17bn annual content budget would make a “solid pot for a good number of mobile games”.
Peters said Netflix will look to both develop its own games and license them from others, similar to how it built up its video business over the past decade.
Recommended
He also sees scope for Netflix to offer games developers and players a better deal through subscriptions. “We don’t have to think about ads. We don’t have to think about in-game purchases or other monetisation,” Peters said.
This is not a new business model for video games. Analysts estimate tens of millions of people subscribe to console-based services such as Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus.
But it is relatively new on mobile devices, where Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass, which each cost $5 a month for unlimited access to a bundle of games, are seen as making slower progress.
Netflix is already “really popular” among gamers, said Karol Severin, analyst at Midia Research. Midia’s surveys show 76 per cent of console gamers and 69 per cent of mobile gamers use Netflix every week, compared to 57 per cent of all consumers.
That “nearly guaranteed engagement” will be a strong lure for developers, he said, alongside the company’s strong record in data-driven user recommendations and content commissioning.
“Entertainment is converging,” Severin said. “Whether you are a video, games, music, sports or a social media proposition, you ultimately compete for the same entertainment time and money.”

The company counted 12.1m retail subscribers to HBO Max by the end of June, compared with 9.7m at the end of March. This does not include people who have access to the WarnerMedia-owned service for free through their cable subscription. 
By contrast, Netflix lost 430,000 subscribers in the US and Canada during those three months, fuelling concerns that the streaming giant has lost ground to new entrants in the market it pioneered. 
Netflix still has 74m subscribers in the US and Canada, and 209m worldwide, making it the streaming leader by a wide margin. But investors and analysts are concerned about its slowdown in North America. 
“It should be clear by now that the US streaming market has become much more competitive,” said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Netflix’s position as a first mover is clearly being challenged,” he said, warning that “middle age appears to be setting in” for Netflix in the US. 
In recent years, the largest traditional media groups have consolidated to gain heft as they attempt to reinvent themselves as streaming services and compete with Netflix. Disney acquired Fox for $71bn, while AT&T bought WarnerMedia for $85bn. 
AT&T in May agreed to spin off and combine WarnerMedia with rival Discovery, just three years after acquiring the company, a humbling retreat from Hollywood for the telecom company. 
The deal combined one of the most prized portfolios in entertainment — including Warner Bros film and television studios, the HBO network and a portfolio of cable channels including CNN — with the unscripted programming of Discovery, whose brands range from sport and wildlife to home renovation.
Netflix senior management this week dismissed HBO as a threat. Reed Hastings, co-chief executive, told investors that the Discovery-Warner combination was “not as significant” as Disney’s acquisition of Fox, while adding that he had not seen an impact from HBO on Netflix subscriber growth. 
“Does HBO or Disney . . . have a differential impact compared to the past? We’re not seeing that in the [data],” Hastings told investors. “That gives us comfort”. 
Recommended
Co-chief executive Ted Sarandos also critiqued the Warner deal: “When I look at all of these . . . consolidations, when are they one and one equals three or one and one equals four, versus what most of them tend to be: which is one and one equals two?”
In the past year and a half, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, Comcast, Discovery and others have launched streaming platforms, with mixed success. 
Warner last year launched HBO Max in the US for $15 a month, and expanded to Latin America at the end of June. The service has reached 12m direct sign-ups, and a total subscriber base of 47m to both HBO and HBO Max. This is well below rival Disney, which in May reached 104m subscribers to the Disney Plus service.
HBO’s subscriber growth helped power WarnerMedia revenues to $8.8bn in the quarter, up 31 per cent from a year ago, and higher than the $8.4bn Wall Street had forecast. 
Parent company AT&T posted net income of $1.9bn on $44bn in revenue. AT&T shares climbed 1.6 per cent in pre-market trade.

The California-based company predicted it would add 3.5m subscribers in the third quarter, disappointing investors who were looking for a stronger rebound in the second half of the year. Analysts had forecast that Netflix would add 5.9m subscribers during the third quarter. 
In the past year and a half, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, Comcast and others have launched streaming platforms, and there are more than 100 streaming services for consumers to choose from, according to data company Ampere. 
Yet on a call for investors, executives dismissed the idea that competition was behind the weaker figures.
“Does HBO or Disney . . . have a differential impact compared to the past? We’re not seeing that in the [data] we have,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix co-chief executive. “That gives us comfort.”

Traditional media companies have spent the past few years consolidating in order to compete with Netflix. Most recently, Discovery agreed to merge with WarnerMedia to form a mega-streaming service. 
Referencing the industry consolidation, Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive, told investors: “Let’s see if one plus one equals three . . . versus the typical one plus one equals two.”
Intrigue over Netflix’s plans to delve into video games helped offset the weakness in its core business, lifting the shares 0.8 per cent in after-hours trading.
Netflix last week revealed the hiring of Mike Verdu, a 30-year veteran of the gaming industry. The company on Tuesday said it would initially focus on games for mobile phones and offer games at no extra cost to paying subscribers of the streaming group. 
Hastings framed video games as a complement to Netflix’s existing business rather than a large new profit driver. “We’re a one-product company with a bunch of supporting elements.”
Recommended
In total, Netflix added 1.5m subscribers in the second quarter, just above Wall Street forecasts of 1.1m. 
After adding a record number of customers last year, subscriber growth has slowed sharply as competitors entered the market and people emerged from coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. 
Sign-ups have ground to a halt in the US, Netflix’s largest market, where the majority of Covid restrictions have been rolled back. 
“The pandemic has created unusual choppiness in our growth,” the company’s management told shareholders. 
Netflix executives have blamed the subscriber number weakness on a lighter offering of shows and movies, and promised that growth would pick up in the second half of 2021 with the return of titles such as The Witcher and Sex Education.
Recommended
“Covid and its variants make predicting the future hard, but with productions largely running smoothly so far, we’re optimistic in our ability to deliver a strong second half [shows],” the company said.
Netflix remains by far the largest paid video streaming service, with 209m subscribers, compared with 104m for Disney Plus, its closest competitor. 
Revenues in the second quarter rose 19 per cent from the same period last year to $7.3bn, meeting analysts’ forecasts. Net income increased to $1.4bn, up from $720m a year ago.

Mike Verdu will join Netflix from Facebook, where he oversaw gaming on its Oculus virtual reality headsets. Verdu’s experience includes more than eight years at Electronic Arts, most recently running its mobile gaming division that included smartphone hits such as Plants vs Zombies. 
He also spent three years at Zynga during the heyday of Facebook gaming, overseeing titles such as FarmVille and Mafia Wars. 
That experience points to a Netflix strategy that may look more like Apple Arcade, the iPhone maker’s subscription service for mobile gaming, than a threat to Nintendo or Sony.
A job advertisement for Netflix’s Interactive division invites applicants to help create “new types of features, game-like experiences, and different ways of interacting with stories”. 
At a time when many tech companies — including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon — are already jostling to become the “Netflix of games”, the arrival of the world’s largest TV and movie streaming service will only intensify Silicon Valley’s focus on the most valuable portion of the entertainment industry. 
“Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It’s why we’ve continually expanded our offering, from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV,” Netflix said, confirming the hire. “So we’re excited to do more with interactive entertainment.”
Netflix executives have discussed their growing interest in gaming as a way to extend the company’s franchises and further increase audience engagement with the characters behind popular shows such as Stranger Things. 
“There’s no doubt that games are going to be an important form of entertainment and an important sort of modality to deepen that fan experience,” said Greg Peters, Netflix’s chief operating officer, in an analyst call in April. 
“Really we’re trying to figure out what are all these different ways that we can increase those points of connection, we can deepen that fandom,” he added. “And certainly, games is a really interesting component of that.” 
Verdu will report to Peters. 
In a note to clients on Thursday, analysts at Citi said Netflix’s entry was “significant” at a time when cloud gaming platforms and subscription-based business models were already threatening to disrupt the console market. 
“It is clearly still early days and much of the detail remains to be clarified, but this feels like a significant event with broad ramifications across the video games landscape,” Citi said. “We watch the space with much interest.”
Analysts said Netflix’s involvement may trigger further consolidation in the gaming industry. 
Tech companies such as Google and Amazon have so far struggled to develop successful games in-house, while Microsoft and Sony have been increasingly acquisitive to secure exclusive content for their Xbox and PlayStation consoles. 
Netflix’s first forays into gaming included an interactive episode of its sci-fi series Black Mirror back in 2018. Since then it has licensed third-party developers to create a Stranger Things mobile game. It has also adapted several video games as movies and shows, including The Witcher and Castlevania. 
Bloomberg first reported Verdu’s appointment.

The “upfronts” are a vestige of an entertainment world once dominated by analogue television, lavish commercials and fresh seasons of hit shows released each autumn. The rise of Netflix, which was staunchly against running advertisements, broke that model. 
But Netflix’s abrupt change of heart on advertising just a few weeks ago may turn that around. 
Over the past few years, the excitement surrounding upfronts week waned as television companies set their sights on streaming services — and star-studded parties were replaced with virtual presentations due to the pandemic. Even though television advertising still makes more than $60bn a year, dwarfing the size of trendier mediums such as podcasts, it was a format that appeared set to decay in the long term alongside cable television. 
But advertising is back in vogue. In the past few months, as Netflix stumbled, inflation soared and the stock market tanked, the streamer, along with the other giant of the business, Disney, announced that they would launch cheaper, advertising-supported versions of their services.
“It is scary if the only way to reinvigorate growth is offering cheaper products that worsen the consumer experience, essentially making it more like the dying linear TV experience,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at Lightshed partners.
Accepting advertising is a step that Netflix’s co-founder Reed Hastings had resisted for years. As recently as March 8, the company’s chief financial officer told a conference that Netflix would “never say never, but it’s not in our plan”, adding that “for now it doesn’t make sense for us”.
Hastings reversed this just six weeks later after revealing that Netflix would lose 2mn subscribers in the current quarter. Company officials have given scant information publicly about when or how it would roll out an ad-supported version of the service.
Despite Netflix’s lack of details, advertisers attending the upfronts this week are excited about the possibility of finally being able to reach its binge-watching audiences. Having seen traditional TV audiences decline sharply over the past decade due to “cord cutting”, a successful ad-supported streaming service from Netflix or Disney Plus could give a boost to advertisers. 
Advertisers see “a great untapped audience” of Netflix viewers who are walled off from them, says Brian Wieser, president of business intelligence at GroupM, the WPP-owned agency. 
“Advertisers are very keen to find a new source of inventory, and especially the opportunity to reach [streaming] audiences that have otherwise been hard to reach,” Wieser said. 
Netflix and Disney have the same objective: to add more subscribers offering a cheaper service. The trick is to ensure that the ad-supported service does not drain away too many full-price customers, while also reaching enough people to attract quality advertisers. “These are the trade-offs they have to contemplate,” Wieser cautions. 
Recommended
Bob Chapek, Disney’s chief executive, said last week that the ad-supported service would help Disney Plus, which has roughly 137mn subscribers, gain a broader audience when it rolls out this year. It could also be essential to his goal of reaching 230mn to 260mn subscribers by 2024, a metric investors are watching closely. 
“We believe it’s good for the consumer because it’s going to give us another entry price point,” he said. Disney has a head start over Netflix, since it also controls the Hulu streaming service, which has an ad-supported tier, and experience of selling ads through its traditional TV services, such as ABC. 
“There’s nothing that we need to go acquire or, frankly, even in any significant way develop anything new. This is something that’s well-greased,” Chapek said.
Other streaming services in the US and around the world already have ad-supported streaming, including Warner’s HBO Max, NBCUniversal’s Peacock, and Paramount Plus.
It is less certain how Netflix plans to go about selling advertising. It could use an outside company or develop a sales force in-house, which would probably require significant hiring. It could also choose to acquire an advertising company. But it is still unclear how committed Netflix is to the business. Hastings told investors he could outsource the work to “other people [who would] do all of the fancy ad-matching”.
“It’s not likely that advertising will become a core part of Netflix’s business,” Wieser predicts. 
Netflix is not participating in the upfronts this year, having only weeks ago decided to embrace advertising. But Disney, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros Discovery and others will trot out their stars to woo the people in charge of marketing budgets and lock down billions of dollars in spending commitments. Advertisers committed about $20bn upfront for the 2021-22 television season, rising 8 per cent over the previous year, which was constrained by the pandemic. 
Jason Kilar, the former chief executive of Warner who introduced HBO Max’s ad-supported product, recently told Puck News: “[We] couldn’t start [advertising] soon enough because we recognise that these things are all about people’s household economics, and we want to make this service as affordable as possible to as many people on the planet.”

https://www.ft.com/content/afbf67d1-7349-4fd3-9161-af89b632ba70,Robert Armstrong,"No, you did not see the Netflix mess coming",2022-04-21,04:01:00,"This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday
Good morning. I have Covid, and that’s a drag, but my symptoms are mild. They include a slight sore throat and annoying my family even more than usual. Hope my luck holds. Netflix’s luck has not. I try to tease out the meaning of its very bad day below. Email me your own thoughts: robert.armstrong@ft.com. 
I used to write a lot of columns about how expensive tech stocks such as Amazon or Facebook or Netflix were, and how competition would soon lead to slower growth, and investors were taking terrible risks, and so on. These were very bad, stupid columns, which have been proven hilariously wrong by subsequent events. Many of these columns are on the FT website still. I am not going to provide links; if you want to mock me, do your own research.
Now I have internalised a lot more stuff about zero marginal costs, first- mover advantages, natural monopolies, W. Brian Arthur, limp antitrust enforcement, cost of capital differentials, and so on. Now I think huge tech companies are smart, relatively low-risk things to invest in. What helped me internalise all this stuff was that Amazon and Facebook and Netflix kick exponentially more ass with each passing year.
Netflix’s first-quarter results are the only example I can think of where the exponential ass-kicking of one of these big tech companies came screeching to a halt. Yes, Facebook is wilting, but the suddenness of the Netflix slowdown is something new. Just one example: between the second and third quarters of last year, Netflix added a million new subscribers (a 4 per cent gain in three months!). In this year’s second quarter, the company expects to lose 2 million subscribers. 
The stock fell 35 per cent on Wednesday, and has now lost nearly 70 per cent of its value since October. 
This is not a vindication of my former views. If you had bought Netflix a decade ago, when I was bitching about it in the Lex column, you would still be up 28-fold. But it is worth pointing out at wild moments such as this that most of the time markets do a pretty good job of pricing things. And this looks like one of those times. I don’t think this mess was easy to see coming, and I don’t think the market overreacted to the news. Despite the huge move, the price on Tuesday was fair, given the information that we had, and the price now is fair, given what we have learned. And that may tell us something about the current moment.
Let me try to illustrate this with the following idiotically simple analytic device:
Moving from left to right, we start with Netflix’s
	earnings per share

		in 2021. Next up is Wall Street’s consensus view (as of Tuesday) about the compound annual growth rate of Netflix’s earnings through 2030 (data from Bloomberg). That gives us the third cell, the company’s expected 2030 earnings. Let’s put a price earnings multiple on that that sounds reasonable: 18 is much lower than Netflix’s current multiple, but that makes sense. The company’s prospective is almost certain to get lower with time, and lower-growth companies merit lower multiples. 
The 2030 earnings and the multiple render the estimated end of 2030 price. Last question: at what rate shall we discount that future price back to the present? Ten per cent sounds OK. It is a higher cost of capital than would be implied by what the company would currently pay for new equity or debt funding, but capital is unusually cheap now. Using that discount rate you get a price of $348 — that is, Tuesday’s closing price.
Of course I reverse engineered both the multiple and the discount rate to get the number I wanted, but the point is all these figures are eminently reasonable. Is 17 per cent annual earnings growth wildly optimistic? Well, in the last four years (2018-2021) Netflix’s earnings growth has been 114, 54, 47 and 85 per cent respectively. The company has been consistently widening margins, raising prices and adding subscribers. Ambitious maybe, crazy no. 
Yes, everyone knows that streaming competition is intense as every entertainment company throws money at it — but that’s why the stock had already been cut in half in the six months before this week’s announcement. 
Then came the news. Subscriber numbers are suddenly expected to fall. The outlook for margin expansion (three percentage points a year, exactly what they had been delivering) was put on hold for now. Suddenly, the growth strategy is not taking share from linear TV, but stopping password-sharing and launching an ad-sponsored version of the service. This is from the quarterly letter to shareholders:
Our relatively high household penetration — when including the large number of households sharing accounts — combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds . . . 
COVID clouded the picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021 was due to the COVID pull forward. 
What do we think will be the medium-to-long-term growth rate of Netflix earnings now? Not 17 per cent, surely. Lets try 11 per cent instead. That’s a little less than the company thinks it can do (it’s current “goal” is “to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating income even faster”) but seems reasonable to me. There is loads of leverage in Netflix’s model. If it can squeeze even a few points of revenue growth out of pricing and new markets, double-digit earnings growth should be within reach. Voila: 
The change in growth outlook means stock loses a third of its value . . . just as it did on Wednesday. Reverse engineering again but, I think, reasonable. Perhaps the price damage could have done worse. One has to be more uncertain, now, about the future of this business, which probably justifies a higher discount rate, along with the lower growth estimate. 
To sum up: this was one of the biggest earnings surprises and the biggest one-day sell-offs I have ever seen that involved a big company. And it was neither predictable nor overdone. The notion that it was obvious beforehand that Netflix’s valuation was crazy or that its business model was clearly in trouble — which we heard a lot of yesterday and will hear a lot of in days to come — is hindsight masquerading as foresight.
I propose the Netflix smash-up is evidence that, because of the distortions of Covid-19 (and inflation, too) this is a moment of genuinely high uncertainty for investors in general. This is a dangerous claim to make, because all moments feel uncertain to investors; doubt is the water we swim in. But remember: Netflix’s management team said just three months ago that they would add 2.5 million subscribers in the first quarter. They missed that target, on an adjusted basis, by 2 million. Management did not set the target lightly. This is a team that has learned the hard way that overpromising is the best way to piss off Wall Street. They were blindsided by their own business.
If I’m right about this, this is a moment for conservative portfolio allocations and avoiding high valuations. Don’t pay up for what you can’t reasonably forecast.

https://www.ft.com/content/8724b6f7-87cd-491a-8be0-df9e1e52fe8f,Christopher Grimes,Netflix and Apple vie for Oscar gold to seal streaming’s Hollywood takeover,2022-03-25,22:00:28,"If Oscars were awarded for the most prominent billboards, then Netflix would soon need a bigger trophy case.
Signs promoting The Power of the Dog and Don’t Look Up, the streaming service’s two Best Picture contenders, are impossible to miss along Hollywood’s Sunset Strip as the Academy Awards ceremony approaches this Sunday. Netflix owns about 20 billboards in Los Angeles, including the coveted spots along the Strip, after purchasing them four years ago to highlight programming including its Oscar contenders. 
Using street advertisements might seem like an oddly low-tech move for Netflix, which used digital technology to disrupt traditional film studios from Walt Disney to Warner Bros. But when it comes to Oscar season, Netflix is playing by Hollywood’s rules. 
The art of the Oscar campaign is more rooted in the golden age of cinema than the digital age. Millions are spent on billboards, bus stop adverts, glamorous in-person events and glossy pullouts in industry magazines such as Variety, all aimed at voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Netflix and Apple, which has its own candidate in CODA, are vying to become the first streamer to win the Best Picture award. But Netflix has gone the furthest to ingratiate itself into the Hollywood system, experts say. 
“[Netflix] pride themselves on being in the club,” says Jason Squire, professor of cinematic practice at Southern California university. “Very early on in the streaming business Netflix and others had to position themselves in order to be taken seriously [by the Academy], and they adopted mainstream marketing techniques” to help achieve this. 
Rather than disrupting the process, Netflix and Apple have embraced it by spending heavily on their Oscar campaigns, which can cost studios $20mn or more to promote a candidate for Best Picture, publicists say. 
For traditional studios, such spending might pay off with the “Oscar bump”, a spike in box office revenue that ideally justifies the cost of a promotional campaign. But while streamers may see a subscriber “bump”, they are focused on a different pay-off: cachet with top film-makers and A-list actors. 
“If you’re a studio and you want to attract talent, then spending heavily on a campaign is a way to keep talent under your umbrella,” says Rich Gelfond, an Academy member who is chief executive of Imax, the company known for its large-format cinemas. 
If Netflix is hewing to Oscars tradition, the Academy itself is scrambling to chart its future. After only 10.4mn Americans watched last year’s awards — a 56 per cent drop from a year earlier, and a quarter of its audience in 2014 — the Academy is looking to put on a punchier show by cutting some categories from the main broadcast. 
The idea has prompted howls from some in Hollywood, but for the Academy a crucial revenue stream is at stake. US and international television rights from the production can reach more than $100mn a year. 
Recommended
“The audience for the Oscars is declining, a factor behind the slow whittling away of the Oscar patina,” Squire says. “[The Academy ] has a powerful branding legacy and it’s their job to maintain and burnish it.” 
Some say the Academy has made problems for itself in recent years by honouring worthy but lesser-known films instead of blockbusters. Last year’s Best Picture winner, Nomadland, took in only $39mn globally at the box office, albeit in a pandemic-stricken year. 
“I think they need to align some of their vision of what’s a good movie with what the public defines as a good movie, judging by the box office or otherwise,” says Gelfond. “The last few years have been notable for the lack of movies that did well at the box office.”
The Academy has been trying to modernise in other ways. Membership has increased from about 5,800 in 2015 to around 10,000 as it sought to increase its racial, ethnic and gender diversity. Many new members are from the streaming industry. 
Gelfond says, perhaps controversially, that allowing streamers to compete in the Oscars has diminished the award. “The cinematography is different. It’s just a different talent for streaming on TV than it is for a theatrical release,” he says. “Once you start to blur those distinctions you take away from the specialness of what an Oscar means.” 
His comments reflect the bitter feelings directors, producers and actors still harbour at the decisions by Warner Bros, Disney and other studios to debut new movies directly on to their streaming services instead of allowing them an exclusive run in cinemas. 
While these “day and date” release decisions were made as Covid-19 shut many cinemas, the practice is expected to continue past the pandemic — which filmmakers argue limits their performance-related bonuses. 
It is not just the traditional studios that are being buffeted by the streaming-first world. Netflix, too, is under pressure from the new competition from Disney Plus, HBO Max and other streaming services heavily funded by traditional studios. Netflix shares have fallen 37 per cent in the past six months amid concerns over slowing subscriber growth. 
For some of the more traditional Best Picture nominees, the Oscar boost has already started. Dune, King Richard and Belfast all received box office “bumps” following the release of the Oscar nominations in February, notes Paul Dergarabedian, a senior analyst at Comscore. 
In the first week after the nominations were announced on February 4, King Richard’s US box office take had a sixfold rise as the film went into wider release. Dune, which has brought in more than $400mn worldwide since its release, had a spike of nearly 350 per cent. Both are Warner Bros films. 
“The Oscar bounce is alive and well,” Dergarabedian said. “The Oscar nomination may be that push people needed to get them out to see the film at a movie theatre, where the film-maker intended it to be seen.”

https://www.ft.com/content/4cf36a19-ef31-4b02-ac60-cc0714fbd312,Fiona Sturges,"Tiger King 2, Netflix — the improbably successful documentary is back",2021-11-17,08:01:38,"“We’ve only scratched the surface,” runs the tagline for this second series about the wacky world of Joe Exotic, aka Tiger King, and his nemesis, the animal rescue campaigner Carole Baskin. This is technically true, though only if we accept that what lies beneath the surface is the most unholy parade of fame-hungry chancers, nitwits and ne’er-do-wells, all of them desperate to get their faces on one of the most improbably successful documentaries of recent times.
First, though, a recap. Last year, as the world went into lockdown, Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness arrived on Netflix: a series about a mullet-haired, heavily tattooed, gun-toting owner of a big cat park. At first, Joe Exotic seemed merely eccentric, a loudmouth exhibitionist with a taste for publicity stunts (in 2016 he launched a presidential bid and later ran for governor of Oklahoma). But then a darker side to the story emerged that took in alleged suicide, animal abuse and a murder plot involving two hired hitmen. In 2019, Exotic was found guilty of animal cruelty and of plotting to kill Baskin, who for years had been trying to shut down his zoo. The series was a runaway hit, watched in 64m households within a month of release.
Since then, as revealed in this fitfully watchable but entirely surplus-to-requirements sequel, Baskin has appeared on the reality series Dancing With the Stars (big cat costumes all the way) and Exotic and his supporters have mobilised a campaign for a presidential pardon. Their bid came to nothing, with President Trump presumably deciding that exonerating a peculiarly-coiffed, orange-hued, publicity-seeking TV star would be a step too far. Meanwhile, assorted individuals with often tenuous connections to our protagonists, from zoo volunteers and neighbours to ­— hey, why not? — Baskin’s ex-husband’s handyman, have come out of the woodwork to solemnly share their insights.
The series ostensibly poses two questions: was Exotic’s conviction a stitch-up masterminded by his enemies, and did Baskin, as posited by some in the first season, kill her first husband, Don Lewis, and feed him to the tigers? (Baskin has denied this wild accusation.) Among the principal players in the latter inquiry is a YouTuber and self-proclaimed “armchair detective” known as Ripper Jack. There’s also a psychic investigator named Troy Griffin, hired by Lewis’s daughters in an attempt to find out what happened to their dad following his disappearance in 1997. After visiting a house in Florida, Lewis’s last known location, it takes Griffin roughly 20 seconds to alight on the supposed site of the alleged murder. “There’s some bad juju here,” he says darkly, before throwing up in the bushes and bursting into tears.
What we are witnessing here is a streaming network cynically squeezing every drop out of a once grimly fascinating but now spent story. Mercifully, the proposed Amazon movie with Nicolas Cage has been canned, though you can bet on more content coming down the pipe. There is no more apt commentary on this series than when Exotic, broadcasting from prison in the opening episode, announces: “Welcome to my world of bullshit.”

https://www.ft.com/content/42762727-db7e-4f77-9ae3-f57c472d8e8c,Patrick McGee,Apple to ease payment rules for apps such as Netflix and Spotify,2021-09-02,03:30:59,"Apple said on Wednesday that it would loosen strict payment rules for certain app developers including Netflix and Spotify, allowing them to include links to their websites that would enable the companies to bypass the fees imposed by the iPhone maker.
The concession was prompted by an investigation into Apple’s App Store by the Japan Fair Trade Commission but will apply globally. From early 2022, Apple will let developers of these apps share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their accounts, the tech group said late on Wednesday.
The tech group’s decision came after South Korea this week became the first country to pass a law that would allow mobile phone users to pay software developers directly for their apps rather than be forced to do so via the in-app payment systems of platforms such as Apple and Google.
Separately, Apple last week relaxed a restriction on its App Store that prevented developers from offering lower prices to customers through other channels. 
The latest change could have far-reaching implications, as the likes of Spotify have long alleged that it was unfair for Apple to have its own competing music service while also playing a gatekeeper role with its App Store and charging Spotify a commission.
Developers around the world have complained for a decade that Apple’s payment rules were too strict and unfriendly to consumers. 
Apple generally requires all digital payments to flow through its in-app payments system but it has allowed an exception for “reader” apps, an entertainment category in which users subscribe or purchase digital goods often consumed on multiple devices. Among the biggest services in this category are Netflix, Spotify and Kindle.
Netflix subscribers, for instance, are able to sign up and pay for their account on the internet. But Apple has not previously allowed the service’s app to inform customers of this option, which would deprive the iPhone maker of the 15 to 30 per cent commission it derives from purchases made through its App Store.
Recommended
Other apps, including popular games, must still process all digital goods payments through Apple’s in-app payment system. That requirement became the catalyst for a lawsuit, when Epic Games, maker of Fortnite, bypassed the Apple Store with its own, cheaper payment method, resulting in Apple banishing the app last year. A verdict in the lawsuit is expected as soon as this month.
Tim Sweeney, chief executive of Epic, wrote on Twitter that Apple was merely widening an already unfair exception to its strict rules. “Apple’s special deal for ‘reader apps’ like Amazon video, Netflix, and Kindle just got more special,” he said.
He added: “It’s hard to discern the rationale that this is safe while Fortnite accepting direct payments remains unsafe.”
One big reader app developer said: “We need to evaluate the amendments to Apple’s developer guidelines, but a limited anti-steering fix does not solve all our issues.”
Phil Schiller, an Apple Fellow who oversees the App Store, said: “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission and appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help developers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and manage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and maintaining their trust.”
The JFTC App Store investigation is now closed.

https://www.ft.com/content/ac4ebc50-457b-4131-99b0-669340d3389b,Nikki Sun,"Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent learn Netflix lessons in content fight",2021-06-08,22:00:21,"China’s long-form video platforms are stepping up acquisitions of popular media content and producing their own shows to lure back viewers from short-video apps.
Baidu-backed iQiyi, Alibaba’s Youku and Tencent Video all reported better than expected user growth in their most recent quarterly earnings thanks to the popularity of several self-produced variety shows and television series.
The increased emphasis on original content at China’s trio of big video-streaming platforms echoes the successful approach of global companies such as Netflix. The strong earnings are a boost to these older streaming platforms after years of losing out to newer short-video apps Douyin and Kuaishou as well as mid-form video site Bilibili.
It suggests that investing in content will become more important in China’s video industry at a time when leading players are encroaching on to each other’s turf.
“The products offered by different video platforms are starting to converge,” said Carlton Lai, an analyst with Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong.
This article is from Nikkei Asia, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan.

Tech giant Tencent, which operates China’s largest long-form video platform, last month pledged to increase investment in short videos as one of three key strategic areas. Management at short-video app operator Kuaishou also expressed interest in having more long-form videos on its platforms.
Whether they could retain viewers would depend on their ability to secure exclusive and appealing content, Lai said.
During the first quarter, Tencent benefited from its popular TV series The Land of Warriors, an adaptation of a fantasy novel, and Chuang 2021, a self-commissioned talent show for boy groups.
The success of the shows helped Tencent increase its fee-based subscribers by 12 per cent to 125m in the first quarter from a year ago.
Long-form video platforms such as Tencent Video charge viewers subscription fees to access dramas, films and variety shows that are often not available elsewhere. The business model requires the platforms to spend heavily on production — both Tencent and iQiyi recently raised subscription prices — but hit shows can draw explosive and profitable traffic.
Alibaba-backed Youku also benefited from its unexpected blockbuster Word of Honor. The fantasy series, adapted from a gay romance novel, became an instant hit even though homosexuality remains taboo in China.
The drama’s success prompted Youku to hold offline concerts featuring its main stars. Tickets priced at up to Rmb2,280 ($356) sold out within 14 seconds.
While Alibaba does not disclose viewer numbers for the video platform separately, it said Youku’s loss narrowed in the first quarter while the number of average daily subscribers rose 35 per cent year on year in fiscal 2020-21 ending in March.
After losing viewers for more than a year, Baidu-owned iQiyi gained 3.6m subscribers to hit 105m in the first quarter thanks to the TV series My Heroic Husband, about a businessman who travels back in time and marries the daughter of a merchant. The drama triggered heated online discussions about gender equality. iQiyi, also one of the blockbuster’s producers, said the success “validates its exclusive content strategy”.
However, analysts expect the platforms to face greater government controls after a recent scandal in which fans bought and wasted tonnes of bottled milk just to cast extra votes for their favourite contestants during an iQiyi-produced boy group variety show. Part of the marketing strategy called for voters to scan the QR codes on bottled milk caps. State media urged the video platform and brand sponsors to act more responsibly, prompting the media regulator to force iQiyi to cancel the season finale.
Under new guidelines, video platforms would not be allowed to encourage voting through goods purchases or membership sales, said iQiyi chief executive Gong Yu during an earnings call last month. “This means that voting in the future will be free,” he said, adding that iQiyi was still evaluating the impact on advertising revenue.
Idol survival shows, including Tencent’s Chuang series and iQiyi’s Youth With You, have become huge in China thanks to the global success of South Korean girl and boy groups. The programmes were the most popular genre on the majority of video-streaming platforms and generate lucrative returns through fan voting and brand sponsorship.
“The milk-wasting incident will have an impact on the whole industry,” said Martin Bao, an analyst at ICBC International. He expects the auditions for such shows to be more closely screened by media regulators in order to ensure they reflect correct social values.
Meanwhile, short and mid-form video platforms are exploring new revenue sources after accumulating a large user base. Both Kuaishou and Bilibili listed in Hong Kong during the quarter, raising billions of dollars to fund expansion and content acquisition.
At Kuaishou, average daily users rose 26.4 per cent to 379.2m in the first quarter, though losses widened to Rmb57.8bn from Rmb30.5bn in the same quarter last year.
Since being established, Kuaishou has generated most of its revenue from the sale of virtual gifts — a form of convertible cash that fans give to livestreaming hosts to show appreciation.
However, online marketing revenue, primarily from advertising, overtook this segment for the first time in the first quarter, contributing more than 50 per cent of total revenue after year-on-year growth of 161.5 per cent. Total sales from Kuaishou ecommerce operations grew 219.8 per cent to Rmb118.6bn from a year ago.
Robin Zhu, an analyst at Bernstein, noted that the short video platform has to spend more on sales and marketing to achieve the same revenue growth as in the past. “Looking ahead, we worry that further increases [in user acquisition costs] will continue to put pressure on Kuaishou’s growth efficiency and reported margins,” he wrote in a report.
During the period, Bilibili was able to increase its advertising revenue to Rmb714.7m, up 234 per cent from the same period last year driven by its effort to link advertisers with high-quality content creators. Monthly active users increased 30 per cent to 223.3m and total revenue grew 68 per cent to Rmb3.9bn.
Both Kuaishou and Bilibili could face greater scrutiny of their content. Beijing is preparing to act against copyright infringements on short video platforms after pleas from the film and TV industry.
Unlike their long-form rivals, Kuaishou, Bilibili and Douyin generate substantial audiences through content uploaded by individual creators — content that sometimes uses clips from TV series and films without seeking proper copyright approval. Such practices are increasingly raising eyebrows at production studios and licensed video platforms.
China’s National Copyright Administration said during a media conference in April that it would intensify its scrutiny of copyright infringements on short video platforms after more than 70 TV and film production companies issued a joint statement calling for an end to such practices. Youku, Tencent Video and iQiyi also backed the initiative.
“The short video platforms might need to acquire more [original content] to avoid such regulatory risks,” said Daiwa analyst Lai.

https://www.ft.com/content/48c06611-1c17-4941-96cc-b085dfe05cdf,Anna Nicolaou,Netflix outpaced by the old media companies it sought to dethrone ,2021-05-14,04:00:48,"Heavy is the head that wears The Crown. 
Once a scrappy upstart of the TV industry, Netflix has become the king of streaming with 208m subscribers — nearly half of the world’s total excluding China. 
But the latest round of quarterly results from media companies, which concluded on Thursday night with figures from Disney, has shown that the disrupter is now firmly in the role of defensive incumbent.
Three of the old media groups that Netflix sought to dethrone — Disney, HBO and ViacomCBS — all grew their streaming services more quickly in the first three months of this year, fuelling investors’ fears that Netflix must keep pouring billions into new shows to entice viewers or risk losing its momentum.
“Netflix isn’t just in the game, it had a hand inventing it. But prospering is different to plodding, so the rest of this year is crucial,” warned Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Performance in the pandemic was impressive, but anyone can make hay while the sun shines”. 
Netflix added fewer than 4m subscribers globally in the first three months of the year, badly missing its own forecasts. Only 450,000 people signed up in the US and Canada, its biggest market. 
Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder, largely brushed off the threat from rivals after reporting those figures last month, telling investors: “There’s no real change that we can detect in the competitive environment.” 
But Disney Plus lured 9m subscribers in the quarter and ViacomCBS added 6m, while HBO signed up nearly 3m US subscribers to its Max streaming service. 
In the past year and a half, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, Comcast and others have launched new streaming platforms. There are now more than 100 streaming services to choose from, according to data company Ampere, with a dizzying number of niche products such as Shudder, which is dedicated to horror, or Horse & Country, which streams horse races. 
Unlike cable television, which often locked customers into sticky pay packages, Netflix subscriptions can be cancelled with a few taps of a keyboard, making it easier for people to switch among services depending on what they want to watch.
Netflix shares have lost 10 per cent this year, missing out on a broader rally in the stock market. 
Some of this is explained as a pause after a striking rally in its shares in recent years, when the company reached new subscriber heights and investors were willing to pay increasingly high prices for a piece of its future growth.
But there are also signals that Netflix, founded in 1997, is transitioning to a more mature stage.
The company in January said it no longer needed to raise debt to cover the cost of its programming, a milestone after a decade of relying on junk debt to outspend the Hollywood studios. Netflix last month announced a $5bn stock buyback plan. 
Recommended
While Netflix is operating like an incumbent, raising prices and wringing more money from customers, the century-old Walt Disney company and its peers are resembling start-ups, prioritising growth as they lose billions a year on streaming efforts. 
Disney’s direct to consumer business unit — which includes Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN — posted an operating loss of $290m on $4bn in revenue during the quarter. Disney expects to lose money from its streaming business until the 2023 fiscal year. 
“Netflix is at a different phase of growth compared to other streamers,” said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. “It will be many years before many other streaming services turn a profit. All are placing huge bets and will be loss leaders for years.”
The strategy has been good to Disney: its stock has climbed by more than 60 per cent in the past year as investors focused on how many streaming subscribers it added, rather than the billions of dollars it lost to the pandemic. The fact that its first-quarter subscriber number was shy of forecasts by 5m sent its shares lower in after-hours trading on Thursday.
There are now more video streaming subscriptions than there are people in America, according to Ampere, with 340m subscribers to a population of 330m, opening the question of how many services households will keep paying for. 
Executives agree that hits are ultimately the driver of the subscription business. And as Hollywood knows, they are difficult to predict.

Bob Chapek, Disney chief executive, pointed to recent Marvel programming as the catalyst for its recent subscriber momentum. “We are spending a lot of money . . . in order to create content that keeps consumers coming back,” he said on Thursday.
Netflix executives have promised that growth would heat up in the second half of 2021, with the return of shows such as The Witcher. “There’s a lot resting on the beefed out content schedule due later this year,” said Lund-Yates at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Or the spotlight will be on [Netflix] for a lot of the wrong reasons.”

https://www.ft.com/content/7b9ac14d-2dee-491f-9489-1d5aad9fd49f,Anna Nicolaou,Shine comes off the streaming dream as Netflix subscriptions slow ,2021-04-30,13:38:21,"Netflix’s results in the first quarter sent investors one clear message: the pandemic streaming boom is over. 
“We had those 10 years where we’re growing smooth as silk, and [it’s] just a little bit wobbly right now,” founder Reed Hastings told analysts after the company reported sharply slower sign-ups in the first three months of the year. Worse yet, Netflix warned that in the US, its largest market, subscribers would be “roughly flat” through the first half of 2021. 
Part of this is explained by the unique circumstances of the pandemic, with homebound viewers giving Netflix its best year ever in 2020, sealing its lead over fierce competition from Disney, Amazon, Apple and other large companies vying for a slice of the streaming economy. 
Worldwide, the market for subscription streaming services is still growing; there are now more than half a billion subscribers for Amazon, Netflix and Disney alone. The proliferation of rival services has led some observers to question their long-term strength. 
In more mature markets such as the US, Netflix is facing more fierce competition for time and money, whether it is going out, or other viewing options such as YouTube and free, ad-funded streamers such as NBC’s Peacock. 
According to TVision, the US-based audience measurement company, time spent watching TV has steadily increased since October overall, having declined from its peak in April. Yet Netflix’s share of viewing has fallen. It found that the streaming service’s share has declined 5 percentage points to 23 per cent in the past two quarters while smaller rivals have made minor gains. However, it remains comfortably number one.
While this pandemic impact has distorted growth at Netflix and other streaming services, a more concerning conundrum also appeared in the company’s quarterly results. Netflix executives said a weaker content slate, with some programming delayed due to Covid delays, had translated to fewer subscribers. 
“A lot of the projects we had hoped to come out earlier did get pushed because of the production delays,” said Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive, who promised investors the company would get back to a “steadier state” in the second half of the year with the return of hits such as The Witcher. 
Netflix now boasts 208m paying customers, and has transitioned from the disrupter to the incumbent in a new entertainment business defined by streaming. Its valuation has soared to $225bn. 
But even at such scale, recent earnings results suggest that Netflix must keep spending big on programming to juice its subscriber count, raising fundamental questions about whether streaming is a good business, with profit margins that will steadily improve as the pioneers of subscription streaming ease off on investment and raise prices. 
“Even for Netflix, it turns out that fresh, new original content is a critical factor in driving . . . subscriber additions,” said Michael Nathanson, a senior media analyst at MoffettNathanson. 
“That simple observation goes to the heart of our debate on streaming and whether or not current valuations are consistent with the long-term dynamics of the business model,” he added. 
Media groups are splashing out tens of billions a year on television shows and movies as they fight for a share of the streaming market. Netflix said it was on track to spend more than $17bn on content this year, while Amazon, Disney and Warner Media, the owner of HBO Max, are ratcheting up investment in original shows to supplement their archives.
Not all spending translates into popularity or success, though. Hits, whether expensive or cheap to make, are the big underlying force driving the subscription streaming economy. And as Hollywood knows, they are extremely difficult to predict. 
Here the approaches taken by the different streaming services are markedly different. HBO has one of the smallest libraries in the streaming battle — Amazon’s catalogue of mainly licensed movies and programmes is 13 times larger. 
However HBO excels in churning out critically acclaimed shows, as measured by a weighted rating of review websites calculated by Ampere Analysis. Netflix and Amazon’s libraries offer more quantity over consistent quality. 
“We believe the core product proposition of Netflix is ‘something new and different every day’, as opposed to ‘specific hit show XYZ,’” said Todd Juenger, analyst at Bernstein. But he added that subscriber growth could undoubtedly be “hit boosted”. “The more one believes that to be true, the more optimistic one would likely be about [the second half of 2021],” he said.

The company counted 9.7m retail subscribers to HBO Max by the end of March, compared with 6.9m at the end of 2020. This does not include people who have access to the WarnerMedia-owned service for free through their cable subscription.
The additions were well ahead of those of Netflix, which lured only 450,000 new subscribers in the US and Canada in the same period, fuelling concerns that the streaming giant has been hit by increasing competition in the market it pioneered. 
After years of watching Netflix dominate the streaming landscape, the world’s largest media and tech companies have sought to fight back with their own services. In the past year and a half, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, Comcast and others have launched new streaming platforms as they battle for a piece of the future of entertainment. 
With 74m subscribers in the US and Canada, and 208m worldwide, Netflix is the clear leader. However, the company on Tuesday warned that it expected its customer base to remain “roughly flat” in North America during the quarter ending in June, sparking concerns that the group has reached its peak in its largest market.
“Investors should be concerned about [Netflix] subscriber growth in the US and Canada,” said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “New subscriber acquisition growth feels like a significant issue.” 
WarnerMedia is looking to mould one of Hollywood’s most valuable catalogues — spanning the Warner Bros film and television studios, the HBO network and a portfolio of cable channels — into a consumer-facing streaming platform to compete with Netflix. 
Recommended
The company last year launched HBO Max in the US for $15 a month. With 9.7m direct sign-ups, and a total subscriber base of 44m to both HBO and HBO Max, Warner’s growth has been slower than that of rival Disney, which last month reached 100m subscribers to the Disney Plus service.
However, the group touts its higher subscription price compared with rivals as a plus. WarnerMedia made $11.72 per subscriber on average in the latest quarter, well above the $4 on average Disney makes from its streaming subscribers. 
WarnerMedia plans to launch HBO Max in Latin America and parts of Europe later this year. The group is also releasing all Warner Bros films this year on HBO Max at the same time they debut in cinemas, as part of the effort to attract sign-ups. 
News of its subscriber growth came as parent company AT&T reported net income of $7.6bn on $44bn of revenue in the quarter.
Netflix earlier this week dismissed increased competition as a threat to its business, even as it reported a sharp slowdown in sign-ups. On an earnings call, co-founder Reed Hastings said the group was “a little bit wobbly right now”. 
“There's no real change that we can detect in the competitive environment,” he said. “It's always been high and remains high which is what gives us confidence that it's intensely competitive, but it always has been.”

https://www.ft.com/content/e88132b0-bc8d-4c6a-aa60-3677c7c94a73,Jamie Powell,Netflix’s worryingly ‘wobbly’ quarter for stay-at-home stocks,2021-04-21,14:29:32,"“The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away,” is a famous line from the King James version of the Book of Job. This year it’ll equally apply to a number of well-known equities.
The Coronavirus pandemic proved a once-in-a-generation tailwind for a select group of businesses. Whether you were an online goods specialist, a video conferencing company or a seller of high-end home office furniture, the instant transition to a working-from-home world created the sort of consumer demand that was unthinkable just months before. 
As restrictions ease and inoculation rates soar, for the likes of Peloton, Ocado and Zoom, the question has now changed to one of sustainability. Did the pandemic simply pull forward two to three years of demand? Or has it reshaped each industry so much that growth will consistently be higher going forward?
Last night, we got our first real answer.
Netflix reported its first quarter earnings, and it missed by a margin on its expected subscriber numbers. Here’s the FT take:
Netflix added only 4m subscribers in the first quarter, a sharp slowdown from its pandemic-driven gains last year, as the US began to emerge from lockdown. 
At the end of March, the streaming giant had 208m customers globally, it said on Tuesday, falling short of its own guidance for 210m. 
Netflix said it also expected the second quarter to be slower, projecting only 1m subscriber additions and a “roughly flat” customer base in North America, its largest market. 
Estimates for subscribers was 6.4m, according to CNBC. While second quarter subscriber guidance was even weaker, with the Californian company estimating that it might add only 1m customers, versus estimates or 4.6m. 
Even the usually unflappable chief executive and founder Reed Hastings seemed a bit skittish about the numbers on the ensuing conference call, telling Fidelity’s Nidhi Gupta, “we had those 10 years where we're growing smooth as silk”, before adding that the streaming service was “just a little wobbly right now.”
Judging from the figures, it looks like 2020’s subscriber surge was more a one-off than the new normal. Of particular concern is its Latin American business, where according to research shop MoffettNathanson, despite relatively low market penetration rates, Netflix expected “roughly flattish” growth in the second quarter.
The fundamentals were relatively good. Revenue came in just above estimates at $7.2bn, while net income was a full $1bn higher than the same period in 2020. Part of the profitability boost, of course, is to do with costs: delayed productions meant its content

		and related expenses grew slower than expected, boosting margins. The company expects this to continue in the first half of the year, due to “a lighter content slate” and “hence, we believe, slower membership growth”. 
We’re also not sure stable revenues is what investors have signed up for, given the stock trades at a rather pricey 38 times forward Ebitda.
The link between Netflix’s largely junk-bond funded content spend and its subscriber numbers has been one of the focal points for those on both sides of the trade. The bull case has long been that, as it scales, Netflix can reduce its content spend while both maintaining subscriber numbers and raising prices. Revenue, margins and, therefore, profits will follow. 
The bears, meanwhile, don’t believe in this conscious uncoupling between content and subscribers. Any attempt to take its foot off the content pedal will mean maintaining, let alone growing, subscribers becomes a serious challenge. This problem is potentially further exacerbated by Netflix chasing new markets like India, where not only are the revenues per subscriber lower, but tastes far more local. Bollywood content, it goes without saying, is far less fungible across markets than big budget drama like Stranger Things or The Crown. That’s not to mention competitive supply and demand pressures from the likes of streaming rivals Disney, ViacomCBS and Amazon.
Reading too much into a quarter is always an error, but given Netflix’s commentary about the ties between subscriber numbers and content spend, it’s not hard to think the bears might have got this one right. At pixel, Netflix’s shares are down 7.8 per cent to $507.
As for the other stay-at-home stocks? Well, it’s easy for people to say a bad quarter for Zoom, Wayfair and Ocado is “already priced in”. But, looking at the market reaction to Netflix’s results, we’re still not quite sure that’s the case.

At the end of March, the streaming giant had 208m customers globally, it said on Tuesday, falling short of its own guidance for 210m.
Netflix said it also expected the second quarter to be slower, projecting only 1m subscriber additions and a “roughly flat” customer base in North America, its largest market. 
“We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year due to Covid-19 production delays,” Netflix told shareholders, warning that the pandemic would create “uncertainty” over its results.
The 4m figure for first-quarter subscriber growth compared with 16m in the same period a year ago, during the first few months of the pandemic. Netflix recorded 37m new subscribers in 2020 overall.
“The pandemic streaming party has firmly come to an end,” said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight.
Netflix shares were down more than 7 per cent shortly after the opening of trading. The stock had climbed only 2 per cent this year, underperforming the broader market, after soaring more than 60 per cent last year to a high.
Shares in Disney, whose Disney Plus streaming service has surged in popularity through the pandemic, also opened lower against the backdrop of a broadly flat market.

Netflix’s revenues in the March quarter were up 24 per cent from the same period last year to $7.2bn, just above analysts’ forecasts for $7.1bn. 
Net income jumped to $1.7bn from $700m a year ago, which the company partially attributed to pandemic-related production delays, keeping costs down.
Some analysts pointed out Netflix had a relatively weak slate of new TV and movie content in the first quarter.
“Even for Netflix, it turns out that fresh, new original content is a critical factor in driving gross subscriber additions,” said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “In short, content spend is a form of subscriber acquisition costs. That simple observation goes to the heart of our debate on streaming and whether or not current valuations are consistent with the long-term dynamics of the business model.”
Netflix predicted that growth would heat up in the second half of the year with the return of hit shows such as Sex Education and The Witcher. The group expects to spend $17bn on content this year, with production up and running in most of the world. 
As its subscriber base has soared, Netflix has increased revenue fast enough to cover both its operating expenses and its content spending, marking a milestone in the company’s history. In January, it announced it would no longer need to raise extra debt to cover the costs of producing television shows and films.
A crucial question for investors has been whether Netflix can maintain its lead over the competition, which includes streaming services from Apple and AT&T as well as Disney, and keep up momentum as consumers seek entertainment outside their homes again. 
Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, told shareholders it did not believe competition was a “material factor” in the disappointing first-quarter subscriber numbers.
Netflix remains well ahead of the streaming pack. Disney Plus last month said it had reached 100m subscribers.

		emissions by 2022. 
Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, told the Financial Times that the group was taking responsibility for the carbon footprint of all its branded shows, not just those it makes itself.
“The majority of our footprint is producing shows like The Crown,” he said. “Our imprint is actually creating our content, building sets, moving people around to be able to produce a series or film. The thing that you think of — like the office or [Amazon Web Services] — is pretty darn small.” 
The US company aims to cut its direct emissions, from fuel and electricity, by 45 per cent by 2030 against its level in 2019. 
To reach its net zero goal by 2022, it will compensate for existing emissions by purchasing offsets and funding conservation projects such as grassland restoration.
Cleaner approaches to film production will include the use of electric batteries and transport, hiring local crews, reducing air travel and introducing more LED lights. Virtual production techniques, such as those used in Disney’s The Mandalorian series, also cut emissions by filming actors in front of LED screens showing the digital landscape. 
Emma Stewart, Netflix’s sustainability officer, said: “We are essentially assembling a small city [each time we build a set] and then dismantling it, it comes with a lot of energy.” 
Recommended
Hastings said Netflix would develop a system similar to an “internal carbon tax” in accounting, which would give those with budget responsibility in the company an incentive to cut emissions so they were not charged for carbon use. 
While big tech groups such as Google owner Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft have in recent years set some of the world’s most ambitious climate targets, the entertainment industry has been slower to transform.
Hastings said “the fair comparison” for Netflix was the film and television sector, where he hoped groups such as Walt Disney, ViacomCBS and the BBC “would follow our lead about green productions”. 
“In tech it has been popular, but in entertainment, we’re the first as far as we know to go down that path,” he said. Walt Disney and the BBC have set net zero targets for 2030 and are among many big entertainment groups trying to introduce a cleaner and more sustainable approach to production.
Netflix said the company emitted 1.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, including direct and indirect emissions — about as much as 125,000 US households emit in a year.

However, it excluded from the calculations the emissions from the transmission of its shows to customer devices as well as the electricity used by a particular television or computer.
A 2020 report commissioned by the British Film Institute estimated that an average “tent-pole” movie production would generate 2,840 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to driving a car more than 11m kilometres.
Almost half the emissions in making a film were accounted for by transport, a third from electricity and gas use and a sixth by diesel generators. The consumption needs of a set included the use of enough plywood to fill two and a half cargo planes. 
Hastings said: “Left Bank makes The Crown for us. So nominally we could lay that off on Left Bank’s ledgers. But we say if it is branded — that is what the consumer expects.”

The US streaming company will debut films and shows featuring big-name cast and crew such as producer Karan Johar and actor Madhuri Dixit, as well as second seasons of series including the international Emmy-winning Delhi Crime.
The content roster will amount to a significant increase over the $400m Netflix spent on entertainment in 2019 and 2020, said Monika Shergill, the company’s vice-president for India content.
“We’re betting very, very big on India,” Shergill said. She declined to give a specific figure but added: “This slate is nearly three times that [of 2019 and 2020], so I think you can make an educated guess about how much we’re leaning into programming in India.”
With its giant, film-loving population of 1.4bn, India is a vital growth market for US streaming companies. But the country has proved tricky for Netflix, which has struggled with issues ranging from pricing to political scrutiny since it launched in 2016.
Netflix is the most expensive streaming service in India’s crowded field. Its primary international competitors, Disney and Amazon, have raced ahead in terms of subscribers. While Disney had more than 25m subscribers in December 2020, consultancy Media Partners Asia put Netflix’s India base at 5m.
However, Shergill said Netflix’s pricing strategy is evolving. The company has introduced a mobile-only plan and a tie-up with budget telecom operator Reliance Jio. 
“We are the most premium service in the market and everybody knows that,” she said. “Having said that, if you look at the value that we bring, if you look at the offerings that we have, we’re constantly looking to improve that . . . We’re also looking at how to increase access all the time.”
Netflix’s content push comes as India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party prepares to regulate streaming platforms for the first time.
The US streaming services’ productions have repeatedly sparked the ire of the Hindu nationalist BJP by delving into politically fraught territory. 
Amazon is fighting to keep executives out of jail after airing a show with an allegedly offensive depiction of Hindu gods, and issued an apology on Tuesday. Netflix faced a backlash last year after A Suitable Boy depicted a Muslim boy kissing a Hindu girl in a temple.
Recommended
The government’s rules, unveiled last week, would require companies to appoint a local grievance redressal officer and answer to a self-regulatory body that would be overseen by authorities.
Shergill said the company was still assessing the implications of the rules but was pleased that self-regulation was involved. She said Netflix wanted to continue “telling different kinds of stories” in a “responsible” way, despite the pressure.
“Sometimes people get offended with certain things, but it’s never intended and you don’t plan for those things,” Shergill said. 
“I don’t think one can be overly anxious about that,” she said. “It’s important to really have the right mix of creative expression, the ability to tell a story and to be responsible about it. That’s the balance that one’s always striking.”

https://www.ft.com/content/3b2c539c-76fd-4179-9295-6e987cb7e52c,Dan Einav,Will political documentary survive the age of Netflix?,2021-02-25,12:00:41,"There are times when words speak louder than actions. When Netflix pulled an episode of the satirical current affairs show Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj from its Saudi Arabian site in 2019, its justification sparked as much consternation as the act itself. Asked about the removal of the show, which criticised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and mocked the official account of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said: “We’re not trying to do ‘truth to power’, we’re trying to entertain.” 
At a time when Netflix’s dominance has made it almost a synecdoche for streaming film and TV, Hastings’ comment was seen as throwing into doubt the future of politically engaged filmmaking. In an interview with the FT last year, he conceded that “it wasn’t the best phrase I have ever used”. Netflix also released a statement saying: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request — and to comply with local law.” 
But often actions do speak louder than words. Netflix is again drawing criticism, this time for its failure to back Bryan Fogel’s incendiary new documentary The Dissident, a daring examination of the killing of Khashoggi. With its combination of forensic insight and moving testimonies from fellow dissidents and Khashoggi’s fiancée Hatice Cengiz, it is a film that truly merits that much overused accolade “must see”.
However, despite its strength, and the fact that Fogel gave Netflix its first Oscar for a feature-length film with his previous documentary, Icarus (about Russia’s sports doping programme), the streaming giant declined to acquire The Dissident — as did several other large media companies. Meanwhile, last November, Netflix signed an eight film deal with a Saudi studio.
“What we’ve seen is that the business interests of these companies have taken precedence over human rights violations,” Fogel tells me over Zoom. “Subscriber growth and investment is what is key. The Netflix that distributed Icarus three years ago is a very different company to the Netflix of today.” 
While the streaming platform does host films tackling geopolitics, such as Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom, E-Team and The Square, almost all date from 2017 or earlier. As the company has grown and expanded across the world, its inclination to make or acquire films that address challenging issues in those places has diminished.

		of content means that more and more, stories such as The Dissident are going to have a hard time to be globally distributed,” Fogel says. “I think there’s much to be concerned about if you’re a film-maker such as myself right now.”
It is a sentiment echoed by the Chinese artist, activist and documentarist Ai Weiwei. Over email, the maker of Coronation, about the Covid outbreak in Wuhan, and Cockroach, about the Hong Kong protests, tells me that he now self-releases his films, in the absence of backing from mainstream distributors. “I have tried almost every major avenue, including international film festivals, Netflix, Amazon and Imax theatres. Basically, I have been refused by them all without being given a clear reason.”
For Ai, the reasons are transparent. “The film industry relies so heavily on Chinese investment and access to the Chinese market . . . Any company with business in China accepts censorship from that regime.” And he fears that this risk-averse attitude towards political film-making will discourage new dissenting voices. “The message that has been sent is clear: you cannot survive if you question power.”
Fogel and Ai’s comments are in stark contrast to the widely held belief that we are living through a “golden age of documentary”. While the growing popularity of non-fiction work in recent years is undeniable, it has primarily been driven by films and docu-series whose main strength is easy consumability rather than investigative depth. “Everything has become entertainment,” Ai says. “It is a symptom of capitalism and the ‘winner take all’ mentality that proliferates in society, the desire to extract more profit from the audience through any means necessary. This is a death spiral.” 
While this view perhaps overlooks recent Netflix and Amazon documentaries that have tackled issues such as race, disability and the internet, none risk rocking the boat in international markets, and the most discussed and watched titles of the past few years — such as Tiger King (circa 64m views), The Last Dance and Fyre Festival — all put a premium on entertainment, star power or cult appeal. They may be well-made and watchable, but they are unlikely to change the world.
The success of these titles, coupled with the voracious appetite of viewers for new yet similar content, means the all-you-can-eat buffet must constantly be replenished. And for directors such as the Venice Golden Lion-winning Gianfranco Rosi, this formula-driven, mass-production approach poses an existential threat for the kinds of films he makes. 
His latest film, Notturno, is a spellbinding collage of unhurried and intimate footage acquired over years — in this instance of soldiers, refugees, terrorists, doctors and others caught up in the conflicts across the Middle East. As with his much-garlanded 2016 feature Fire at Sea, there is no guiding narration, no talking heads, not even chyrons to provide context. 
It is the kind of film that “could never be produced by Netflix, Amazon, HBO etc,” he tells me. “They want a story quickly, a 50-page script [turned into] a film. But the moment you write a script you start with a lie. For me a film is a journey. Sometimes I wait three years for something to happen.” 
Indeed, for all the financial muscle they have, Rosi laments how little time and freedom today’s platforms afford their filmmakers. “A deadline is one of the main problems for a documentary,” he says. “You have to trust the director, to create auteurs, otherwise Netflix films risk becoming like commercials — about the brand, not the director’s voice.”
Notturno will be released by Mubi, but in recent months new platforms exclusively devoted to documentary have emerged that offer an alternative to the streaming behemoths. One such, True Story, launched in October, promising “the kind of beautiful and challenging pieces of documentary filmmaking that are harder to find elsewhere”. And in December, the UK’s leading documentary distributor Dogwoof created an “on demand” service. Alongside an array of biographies, crime investigations and stranger-than-fiction tales, it hosts hard-hitting films such as the recent fly-on-the-wall account of a Wuhan Covid ward 76 Days, and last year’s coruscating exposé of corruption in the Romanian healthcare system, Collective. 
CEO Anna Godas explains over email that Dogwoof’s approach is defined by its freedom and commitment to distribute films that “may not bring huge commercial success but contribute to strengthening [the company] and [giving] a deeper meaning to what we do.”
While it would be naive to suggest that a company the size of Netflix could follow the same business model as an independent specialist, the approach of Dogwoof and others serves to show that speaking truth to power and delivering crowd-pleasing entertainment needn’t be a binary choice. 
And if streaming platforms are to continue to attenuate the influence of public broadcasting — still a leading subsidiser of political documentaries in many countries — it seems incumbent on them as the world’s leading streaming service to inform their viewers about pressing global issues. The alternative is what Ai Weiwei calls, with considerable understatement, “unexciting prospects for the future” of documentary.
‘Notturno’ is released on Mubi on March 5; ‘The Dissident’ is screening at the Glasgow Film Festival on March 6 and will be released in the next few months

Yet European media companies are not celebrating this milestone. In virtually every corner of the continent, the dominant streaming providers are American. 
Of the 141m video-on-demand subscriptions in western Europe, some 86 per cent are with US services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus, according to Ampere Analysis estimates. 
While Hollywood used to sell films and TV series to European broadcasters, US streaming services now hoard their best content, building relationships directly with European consumers and muscling incumbents out of their way. 
Netflix is ramping up local productions such as Dark in Germany and Lupin in France, using an estimated global content budget of $17bn this year — almost eight times the BBC’s TV spending, and 12 times that of ITV. 
Disney Plus, which launched less than a year ago, has at least 13m subscribers in western Europe, according to Ampere estimates, bombarding the continent with blockbuster Marvel and Star Wars shows.
Discovery, meanwhile, last month began the rollout of its Discovery Plus service to eight countries and will integrate the Eurosport network, which has the exclusive rights to broadcast Olympics coverage in mainland Europe. 
JB Perrette, chief executive of Discovery International, said the service was having “subscriber growth that is better than we expected — and we had very high expectations”.
In Scandinavia, one European company is holding its own. Stockholm-headquartered Nordic Entertainment Group (Nent) is a relative minnow, with estimated revenues of SKr12.4bn ($1.5bn) compared with Netflix’s $25bn turnover. Yet, it is doing a better job than any other operator on the continent of defending its turf. 
With about 3m subscribers, Nent’s Viaplay streaming service, which offers a mix of premium sport and original entertainment, stands second to Netflix in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway, where Ampere estimates that the US service has about 4.2m customers. 
When it comes to revenue from those markets, Nent says Viaplay — whose packages with sports are higher priced than Netflix — actually generates more than its US rival.
No other domestic subscription service in western Europe can match Nent’s second spot to Netflix in its local market — not the big pay-TV groups such as Sky or Vivendi’s Canal+, nor commercial broadcasters such as RTL, France’s TF1, Mediaset of Italy, or ITV. 
Anders Jensen, chief executive of Nent, described most European rivals as “very conservative”.
“On a scale of 1 to 10 — where 10 is full readiness to go head-to-head with the US giants — I think most are at, maybe, a strong two,” said. “That’s the unfortunate reality of it.”
Nent was quicker than some in Europe to make the streaming switch, in large part because of its relative weakness. While its founder Jan Stenbeck pioneered Scandinavian commercial television in the late 1980s, by the time Mr Jensen took over what was then called Modern Times Group in 2014 its television arm was lacklustre, the second or third player in most markets.

The group, in other words, had less to lose. “The decision was more obvious to us,” said Mr Jensen. “If you have 99.9 per cent of your revenues coming from advertising, it takes a lot of guts to move to a low-priced subscription video-on-demand service. You will have to go through a lot of pain. It is not for everybody.”
Through its Viasat pay-TV business, Nent also had a pan-regional footprint and a reason to invest in a streaming platform that could easily stretch into new markets and languages.
Nent aggressively cut costs in its legacy businesses to fund investment in streaming technology — roughly SKr4bn in total. Like US media groups, it began to ramp up production of original drama shows such as Alex and Veni Vidi Vici, and held back some content from international sales. 
Venturing out of its home market — sometimes as a specialist Nordic drama service, as it plans to launch in the US next year — Nent knows that only subscriber scale will allow it to reap the benefits of a streaming model and sustainably defend its home turf. “We have to go international to be relevant in five, six, 10 years’ time,” Mr Jensen said.
Mr Jensen is now preparing to push the Viaplay service into 10 new territories, aiming for 10.5m subscribers in total by 2025, with 4.5m outside the Nordic region. 
Nent plans to raise SKr3.5bn of equity to fund the rollout, which will start with the Baltics and Poland. It is also considering a secondary listing in the US. Investors are optimistic: the group’s shares have risen 50 per cent in the past 12 months, bucking the downward trend for most listed broadcasters. 
Aside from its offering of expensive live sport — Viaplay is the home of England’s Premier League in Scandinavia — the similarities with the Netflix corporate model are unmistakable. “If you don’t copy some [of Netflix] with pride, then you’re making a mistake,” said Mr Jensen.
Marie Nilsson, a media analyst at Stockholm-based Mediavision, agreed. “Nent see the road to success — and they copy,” she said. “The big question is: why don’t the others?”
Reluctant to abandon their high-priced, high-margin legacy businesses, most incumbents have preferred to dabble in streaming, launching subscription services such as Sky’s NowTV, catch-up players or hybrid platforms like RTL’s TV Now, trying to show that old and new can coexist. 
The challenge of amassing enough customers to make the economics of streaming work is daunting. Lossmaking Disney Plus is not expected to be profitable until 2023, even with a global footprint. 
“The streaming business is a scale business . . . Even on a multimarket basis, it’s very tough,” said Mr Perrette of Discovery. 
Domestic operators in Europe have a valuable asset: a flow of new local content, a crucial hook to attract viewers to platforms. But with Hollywood fare becoming more scarce, that programming is becoming ever more important to fill schedules, while production costs have been driven up by the streaming boom and the pandemic. 
Some European operators will see partnerships, or further consolidation, as ever more attractive. Examples of joint streaming initiatives include Salto in France; Britbox in the UK; and Joyn, a venture between ProSiebenSat.1 and Discovery, in Germany.
Nent is also open to exploring this route so it is not entirely reliant on chasing expensive sport rights and making its own programmes. “We have a platform and some content. Some local players may have a lot of great content but not a platform,” Mr Jensen said. “If we combine those two . . . there is a conversation to be had.” 
While its ambitions could still fall flat, Nent offers traditional broadcasters a rare cause for hope. It is proof that what was an unexceptional, middling European media conglomerate — spanning radio, pay-TV and free-to-air channels — can reinvent itself as a streaming-first company with aspirations to take on Netflix. 
“Nent shows that you don’t need a telecom operator behind you, you don’t need a US owner,” said François Godard of Enders Analysis. “If you are single-minded on the transition, you can do something, even if you are in a small market, even if you don’t have the money to create drama series at $10m an episode.”

Moments later, he is attacked by the sole survivor — his sister transformed into a homicidal demon. 
Devotees of the highly popular blood-soaked anime series can buy Demon Slayer-branded strawberry milk in Japanese convenience stores. They can also buy Demon Slayer lemon-flavoured boiled sweets, curry bread luncheon sandwiches, collapsible chopsticks or a virtual pet. 
These trinkets are sweet icing, but even more valuable has been the underlying cake. In 2020, the manga comic series on which Demon Slayer is based sold more copies than the next nine rival titles combined. When the series jumped from TV to the big screen last October, Kimetsu no Yaiba, produced by a studio owned by Sony, became the highest grossing film in Japanese box office history with sales — even under Covid-19 restrictions — of $300m. 
As the Covid-19 pandemic forces the entertainment world to rethink delivery to an audience now consuming most of its content on small screens, the multibillion-dollar question is whether Japan’s esoteric anime industry and its annual output of more than 107,000 minutes has what it takes to make Demon Slayer the rule, rather than the exception.
For many industry executives, the stage is now set for Japanese animation to truly go global. A newly invigorated Sony is competing with Netflix and global streaming giants to uncover the still untapped trove of lucrative anime content. 
“We were forced to accelerate efforts on all three fronts of digitalisation, global expansion and streaming services. It became now or never,” says George Wada, senior vice-president at Production IG, the company behind the anime hits, Ghost in the Shell and Attack on Titan. “We are on the brink of whether Japanese animation becomes big or remains minor.” 
Superficially, the Demon Slayer phenomenon is just another Japanese craze yoked to a merchandising boom. From Pokémon and Power Rangers to Super Mario and Dragon Ball, Japan has done multibillion-dollar pop-culture frenzies and industrial-scale leverage of intellectual property many times before. But this particular mania, say analysts, academics and executives directly involved, is different. Beneath Demon Slayer are a series of shifts in the structure, ownership and ambitions of Japan’s $24bn-a-year anime industry.
The list of the world’s 25 most valuable media franchises are topped by two Japanese giants — Pokémon and Hello Kitty with respective all-time sales of $92bn and $80bn — and include nine other Japanese names. But behind that success, say analysts, has been a tendency to under-exploit the anime gold mine and a failure to address the many structural problems and heavily criticised labour practices that are hidden behind the most popular titles. 
A year of enforced nesting and increased viewing, however, has accelerated a rethink. The new allure of anime and its profit potential in a digital world is transforming the way media companies look at the genre. 
And as analysts and studios debate whether or not Japanese anime is poised for the global mainstream, some experts believe that its victory as a business model is already secure. The merchandising, games and other revenue ecosystems created by a title like Demon Slayer, One Piece or Gundam and which have long been standard in Japan are now shaping the way Disney, Netflix and others look at their own models. 
“There is change going on in Japan but, at the same time, I think that we are seeing the world catching up to the transmedia models that Japan has been mastering for a very long time,” said Rayna Denison, an academic specialising in Asian media cultures and author of Anime: A Critical Introduction.
The pan-Asian success of the 2016 anime Your Name sparked massive interest in the genre from Netflix and other streaming services. Even Studio Ghibli, Japan’s most famous but also fiercely protective studio co-founded by legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki, struck a deal with HBO Max last year, its first with a US streaming service. Anime studios and manga publishers are streamlining the way production is financed and owned. Japan’s largest cinema operator, Toho, is leading an intensifying push by the broad media sector to be more directly involved. 
“Toho is trying to grow as a content producer. It is now in the midst of the change in philosophy and earning structure. They will be more aggressive,” says Jefferies leisure industry analyst Shinnosuke Takeuchi.
A critical inflection point — where more than half of anime revenues are generated outside Japan — is about to be crossed. Corporate Japan’s frenetic last decade of outbound

		acknowledged that, in a shrinking domestic market, growth must come from overseas: anime is now tentatively doing the same. 
Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services are not only placing their own significant bets on anime, but are empowering and globalising Japanese content that used to be confined to the home market. 
For anime studios and media corporations, Demon Slayer frames both the potential rewards and the investment gamble that each firm must increasingly take on new titles. The phenomenon has emerged, say companies, at a time when the industry appears poised for dealmaking and consolidation. For Sony, whose animation unit Aniplex produces the Kimetsu franchise, it is part of an overarching global strategy to seize greater control of content across music, movies and games. 
“Music, pictures and games are Sony’s holy trinity but they don’t function well together. The company recently claimed anime would be its new cornerstone content. If Sony can bring it together, the results could be amazing,” wrote analyst and Japanamerica author Roland Kelts in a recent report on the industry for the brokerage CLSA. 
Other brokers have also begun to recalculate their forecasts for Sony based on the Demon Slayer phenomenon. In the most bullish scenario, Goldman Sachs analyst Minami Munakata estimates that IP could contribute up to ¥115bn ($1.1bn) to Aniplex’s annual operating profits, including licensing fees from toys and other characters as well as income from distributing the upcoming mobile and console game versions of anime. 
“A lot of investors think Demon Slayer is a one-off for Sony but we don’t think so,” says Ms Munakata. “Sony is in a great position to leverage its IP to a wider platform globally.”
Sony has made an aggressive push into the space in recent years, highlighted by the $1.2bn purchase of AT&T’s anime streaming service Crunchyroll in December. Industry executives say the Japanese group has acquired a global infrastructure with 3m subscribers that will allow it to compete on a more equal footing with the four biggest streaming giants: Netflix, Amazon, Disney to WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. 
Lacking the scale of the global rivals, Sony has deliberately pursued a different strategy of buying anime-specific streaming services with strong local content and committed fans to replicate the success it has had in games, with its 114m-strong user base of PlayStation 4 owners. The deal with Crunchyroll follows the acquisition of a 95 per cent stake in US-based anime distributor Funimation Productions in 2017 and last year’s $400m investment in Chinese animation video share site Bilibili.

“If you want to keep those that have a deep interest in animation engaged, you need to do more than just showing the content. There needs to be after-services such as networking opportunities, social networks and merchandise,” says one industry executive and a close Sony watcher. “That’s difficult to do for a generalist, all-you-can-eat streaming service like Netflix and Amazon.” 
In many ways, Sony’s rising profile in animation was long anticipated. Executives had repeatedly argued that anime is a natural fit for its rich entertainment portfolio that spans PlayStation games, films, television programmes and music. But analysts say Sony’s move should have come long before the global interest in Japanese animation spiked valuations. “Sony’s push into Japanese animation would have been more visionary had they done it a decade ago,” says Macquarie analyst Damian Thong. “Netflix may have an advantage in terms of sheer resources and audience size.”
Similar to how the PlayStation business evolved separately from the group’s broader strategy, Sony has historically struggled to integrate its multiple anime services with music, pictures and games. People close to the company blame silos that had prevented fiercely independent divisions within Sony from co-ordinating their strategy. The result was a fragmented organisational structure where until recently, Funimation was run by Sony Pictures Television with its focus on strengthening franchises and IP that would succeed in the US market. Meanwhile, Aniplex and the streaming services it owned fell under Sony Music Entertainment with most of the emphasis in developing content for the Japanese market.
Under chief executive Kenichiro Yoshida, the group has taken significant steps to rectify the internal divides to leverage the strength of its entertainment portfolios. Last year, it merged Aniplex’s French streaming service Wakanim and Australian distributor Madman Entertainment with Funimation, creating a more unified platform ahead of the Crunchyroll deal. 
While Sony got its house in order, Amazon and Netflix have steadily expanded their foothold in Japan, bringing fundamental changes not only in the way content is produced but also financed. When asked about its strategy, Amazon says it is “fully committed” to anime content. “Fans in Japan and around the world will see more coming from us in that genre. It’s only day one,” it says. 
Rival Netflix has also made investments in recent years to hire talent in Japan and develop ties with animation studios. The global streaming services are now major providers of financing for anime production, replacing the traditional distributors of video and DVDs. Their increasing influence as well as financial power mean studios now need to target the global audience at the start of content production, rather than simply exporting local hits to international markets. 
“There needs to be a transition in mindset from domestic to global. It will lead to polarisation between those who are successful in making that change, and others who will be consigned to serving as subcontractors,” says Soichiro Fukuda, senior analyst at consulting firm Frontier Management. 
Sony’s aggressive — arguably belated — move on anime raises two pivotal questions. The first, expected to play out over the next few years, is whether the strategy that has finally unified Sony’s strengths in content and hardware will genuinely meet the hopes that it has raised with investors, who have propelled Sony’s shares to a 21-year high. The more immediate question, though, is whether the rest of the anime industry is well positioned to replicate Sony’s success or, potentially, come up with a better model. 
The signals are mixed. Following the success of Demon Slayer, analysts have focused on the potential upside of a formerly sleepy, domestic-focused industry that once globalised cautiously or by accident but may now be doing so through invigorated, profit-hungry design. 
But there is still, says Mr Kelts, a deep-seated conservatism and domestic focus that may trip the industry up. For many years, international sales even by larger studios have been haphazardly managed. IP leakage via piracy and poorly policed streaming sites have been one of the main routes through which anime has built its fan base around the world. Smaller studios, he adds, lack the sophistication to take advantage of their content.
“If you look at Demon Slayer and the big studios like Aniplex, they have had a fantastic year. The small studios, meanwhile, are dying. These changes in the industry that everyone is talking about are real for the big guys. Lower down, they are paying staff terribly, missing opportunities and not changing when they need to,” says Mr Kelts.
Nevertheless, Mr Kelts acknowledges, the general momentum looks good. In the 10 years before 2012, the Japanese anime industry was in the doldrums but, according to the Association of Japanese Animations, turned a corner that year and then sales grew at a compound annual rate of 9.4 per cent until 2019. Consensus forecasts among research firms suggest that, from a current value of $24bn in 2019, the industry will expand to $33.6bn by 2026. Much of that rests on the theory that

		will fuel growth.
“We’ve known for a long time that Japanese IP resonates throughout Asia, but I think it’s becoming more and more clear the degree to which these IPs can really work wonders in terms of sales of digital content and merchandise,” says CLSA analyst Jay Defibaugh, citing the ways in which IP owned by Japanese toy and games groups like Konami and Bandai Namco had scored resounding recent successes in China.
For Toei and other large anime studios, leading the industry as a whole, overseas revenues are poised to overtake domestic for the first time. Global ambitions — with a particular focus on the growth potential in China and Asia — are underpinned by a rising sophistication among Japanese anime executives. The investment and development consortium behind Demon Slayer involved only three companies — a striking contrast with the larger, more conservative and more unwieldy 10-12 strong consortiums that would traditionally have been drawn up.
“It is difficult to operate a business solely in Japan any more,” says Production IG’s Mr Wada. “Instead of a two-stage process where we deliver titles that were hits in Japan to the rest of the world, we must now focus on content that will resonate not only in Japan but internationally.”

Since 2011, when Netflix leapt into original programming with House of Cards, the video streaming pioneer has funded acquiring content through high-yield bonds as it sought to outspend Hollywood studios and build an enticing catalogue. 
Netflix’s latest quarterly figures on Tuesday underscored how successful that strategy had been: the streaming giant had almost 204m subscribers at the end of 2020, it said, having added 37m paying customers last year. 
Some 8.5m of those were added in the quarter to the end of December, eclipsing analysts’ forecasts of 6m. 
“We believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations,” Netflix said in a letter to investors, adding that it would explore stock buybacks.
The shares jumped about 12 per cent in after-hours trade.
Recommended
The California-based company has delighted investors in recent years despite burning billions of dollars in cash. Over the past decade, Netflix borrowed more than $16bn in debt as it raced to build a war chest of content. During that time, the value of its stock grew by more than $200bn. 
Netflix had promised that as it hooked more customers and raised subscription prices, it would eventually no longer need raise junk debt to fuel its content spending. Critics questioned whether the company would be able to grow quickly enough to outpace its debt payments. 
But Netflix’s thesis has largely played out, helped by a global pandemic that lured people stuck at home under lockdowns to its streaming platform and kept it comfortably ahead in the race for subscribers. Its fiercest rival, Disney Plus, has 87m subscribers.
The majority of sign-ups in the fourth quarter came from outside the US. In October Netflix, raised prices in the US, its largest market, by $1 to $14 a month for its most popular plan. 
Recommended
As subscriber numbers have soared, revenue has grown sufficiently for Netflix to foot the bill of both its operating expenses and its heavy content spending. Revenues in the fourth quarter were up 22 per cent from the same period last year to $6.6bn, in line with analysts’ forecasts.

		position was significantly improved. For the quarter, the cash outflow was $284m, narrowing from $1.7bn a year ago, and the company said it expected to break even this year and be cash flow positive after that. 
“Rapid subscriber growth means cash flow is on the up, and external finance is apparently no longer needed to plug what was a cash sinkhole,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, adding that the company’s ability to raise prices feeds a “virtuous loop”.
“The [price] hikes allow it to create better content, boost engagement and then shake more pennies from customer pockets, so the cycle goes on,” she said.

https://www.ft.com/content/deb46ed1-b6c3-4e57-9054-1dca16dadad0,Benjamin Parkin,Amazon and Netflix look beyond Bollywood for India’s next big hit,2021-01-01,01:50:38,"Hungry for new content after Covid-19 hit production, Amazon, Netflix and cinema chains in India are betting not on celebrated Bollywood blockbusters to grow audiences but on films by non-Hindi rivals — Tollywood, Mollywood and Kollywood.
India, which has the world’s biggest number of cinemagoers, is home to dozens of languages, but films shot in Hindi, the most widely spoken, dominate.
Bollywood, the Mumbai-based Hindi-language industry, took 43 per cent of gross box office returns in 2019 even though it accounted for only 14 per cent of releases, according to EY, the professional services firm. India’s filmed entertainment industry as a whole was worth $2.6bn the same year.
But facing strong demand for original material and a dearth of new content due to coronavirus lockdown-related production shutdowns, streaming groups and cinemas are pushing dubbed or subtitled releases of south Indian-language films. Many were shot before the pandemic, but previously had limited national appeal. 
Netflix released its first original film in Tamil, the drama Paava Kadhaigal, in December, while Amazon Prime Video has put out a string of regional-language titles like Telugu comedy Middle Class Melodies, C U Soon, a Malayalam-language thriller and Tamil drama Soorarai Pottru.
“We’re able to give reach to these films . . . which in the past may have been challenging given the screenings these films would have got outside their home state,” said Gaurav Gandhi, Amazon Prime Video’s country manager.
The push into regional language content, which began before coronavirus but was accelerated by the pandemic, opens another front in the competition between US streaming platforms in India, which are looking to expand their reach beyond English and Hindi speakers. The movie-mad country of 1.4bn is considered one of the most-promising entertainment markets globally, thanks to rapid internet adoption and rising disposable incomes.
Multiplex chains including PVR and Inox, meanwhile, are banking on a series of non-Hindi blockbusters due to be released in January, such as Tamil thriller Master, to lure back audiences kept out of theatres by Covid-19.
One industry executive said if these films were successful, it could encourage Bollywood producers to release Hindi blockbusters whose 2020 debuts were delayed by coronavirus into cinemas. These include cricket drama 83 from Anil Ambani’s Reliance Entertainment.
“The role [south Indian cinema] is going to play . . . is more important than ever before. We’re looking at a shortage of content,” the executive said. “If people turn up and these movies do well, then it’ll give a lot of confidence to other producers.”
“They’re experimenting,” said Rakesh Jariwala, a media and entertainment partner at EY. “They need something to keep going.”
Recommended
Local-language film industries in southern states such as Tamil Nadu (Kollywood), Telangana (Tollywood) and Kerala (Mollywood) are already thriving, producing hits and stars that are followed globally by regional diasporas and beyond. Telugu-language 2017 action film Baahubali 2 was one of the highest-grossing Indian films ever.
Streaming businesses say that they are helping build interest in regional productions in India’s largely Hindi-speaking north and overseas. Malayalam-language Jallikattu, India’s official entry to 2021’s Academy Awards, was streamed on Amazon Prime Video.
Historically, southern Indian films “would get a really limited release” elsewhere, said Suparna Sharma, a film critic at newspaper the Asian Age. “Now with this lockdown and Covid, there are obviously [streaming] platforms which are desperate and hungry for content.”

https://www.ft.com/content/a4eeeb63-354e-404b-a5f8-12f3be0e9532,Benjamin Parkin,Netflix goes on India promotion blitz to catch up with streaming rivals,2020-12-04,02:52:17,"Netflix has turned to aggressive promotions and discounts in India as it tries to gain ground on Amazon and Disney after investing heavily in the country’s promising but fiercely competitive streaming market. 
Viewers in India will be able to watch Netflix content for free on Saturday and Sunday this week as part of a so-called “StreamFest”, the first big promotion of its kind the US company has run globally.
It is one of a growing number of offers and discounts that Netflix has introduced in India as the streaming giant reassesses its premium approach in price-sensitive market.
Media Partners Asia, an advisory firm, estimates that Netflix will have about 5m subscribers in India by the end of 2020. That tally is well behind Amazon’s 17m and Disney’s more than 25m, the market leader thanks to its acquisition of local platform Hotstar, according to the firm.
Indians love the global quality but not the global prices
“They’re not only having to get their content right, but they’ll have to work on better economics,” said Mihir Shah, vice-president of MPA. Netflix wants to “showcase [its service] to a much more mass market”, he added, referring to this weekend’s promotion. 
In 2018, with Netflix’s India business still in its infancy, chairman Reed Hastings said he hoped to reach 100m subscribers in the country, underscoring how global media groups view India as the next great growth market.
Netflix invested Rs30bn ($406m) to develop its roster of Indian content in 2019 and 2020, including original films and shows like the Emmy award-winning Delhi Crime.
But the company has hit a long-running challenge for multinationals entering India, many of which have struggled to grow in the country while charging prices on a level with other markets.
Despite India’s 1.3bn population, economists estimate that the proportion with spending power comparable to western markets is 50m or less. Companies such as Harley-Davidson have pulled out of the country altogether after struggling to balance price sensitivity with profitability. 
Companies “come with their global strategy, global pricing, global quality of products”, said Jayanth Kolla, founder of consultancy Convergence Catalyst. “Indians love the global quality but not the global prices.”
Recommended
Netflix introduced a cheaper, mobile-only plan priced at just Rs199 a month last year. That is less than half the price of its other packages, but its services in India are still costlier than Amazon’s and Disney’s.
Netflix has taken other steps to broaden its appeal, including launching a Hindi-language interface and tying up with India’s largest telecom operator, Reliance Jio. 
The company declined to comment. But on an October earnings call when it announced this weekend’s promotion, chief operating officer Greg Peters called it “a great way to expose a bunch of new people . . . and hopefully get a bunch of those folks to sign up”.
Mr Kolla said that if the promotion can convince new viewers that Netflix’s content is superior to that of its rivals, it “will take a win”.

Nordic Entertainment Group (Nent) said on Tuesday it would enter Poland and the US next year, as well as the three Baltic states and five other unnamed European countries by 2023, as it seeks to compete in a global streaming market dominated by US players such as Netflix, Disney, HBO and Amazon.
Nent is also considering a secondary listing in the US to boost its visibility and allow better comparisons to other streaming companies, according to chief executive Anders Jensen.
“This is, in my view, the biggest venture into streaming in Europe ever. We are defining ourselves as a growth company out of a Nordic success story,” Mr Jensen told the Financial Times.
Nent is a fraction of the size of the US streaming giants with its Viaplay service having 2.8m subscribers at the end of September. It plans to double its Nordic subscribers to 6m by 2025 and add about 4.5m paying customers internationally in the next five years.
Analysts at Citigroup called the growth plans “strikingly ambitious” but warned that they had to be balanced with “relatively high execution risk” and the need to raise capital.
Shares in Nent, which have risen more than two-thirds since it was spun out of Swedish media company Modern Times Group last year, rose 7 per cent to a record high of SKr394.2. 
There are almost no pure-play European streaming companies, with most services on the continent provided by national legacy TV groups. “We are the only real contender right now,” Mr Jensen said. “We have carved out a leadership position. We think there’s a role for Nordic and European content on a global scale.”
Nent markets itself as broader than Netflix, offering not just entertainment — much of which it produces itself — but also sports. Its main selling point for entering Poland is a four-year exclusive contract to broadcast German Bundesliga football with interest in the country high due to Polish star Robert Lewandowski playing for Bayern Munich.
The business model for streaming sports remains unproven. Netflix has to date steered clear of buying live sports rights because of expensive costs, with Reed Hastings, the Netflix founder, saying it offers “no long term profitability, nothing defensible”.
In the US, Viaplay will be promoted on the strength of its Nordic dramas, as Mr Jensen said there were growing signs that American consumers were opening up for non-English language content.

The video streaming group added only 2.2m subscribers from July to the end of September — well below the 16m and 10m subscribers it added in the first and second quarters, respectively. 
Netflix further warned that “as the world hopefully recovers in 2021”, subscriber additions were “likely to be down” in the first half of next year, compared with 2020. 
Wall Street analysts had anticipated Netflix’s growth spurt to slow in the third quarter as lockdown restrictions eased and some live sports returned. They also raised concerns that blowback over Cuties, a Netflix original film that some conservative politicians censured as “child pornography”, could prompt customers to cancel their subscriptions. 
Still, Netflix shares slipped more than 6 per cent in after-hours trade on the tepid results, which missed analyst forecasts for 3.6m new subscribers and Netflix’s own guidance for 2.5m. 
The group’s shares have soared more than 60 per cent this year, as the coronavirus pandemic and stay-at-home era helped to power its fastest subscriber additions ever, making it one of the biggest winners of the lockdown economy.

Ross Benes, an eMarketer analyst, said the results highlighted Netflix’s saturation in the US, its largest market. 
In the three months ending in September, Netflix added only 180,000 subscribers in the US and Canada. Instead, the main source of growth in the quarter came from the Asia-Pacific region, where it added 1m subscribers. 
“With domestic net adds slowing, revenue growth will likely come from price increases,” said Mr Benes. 
Netflix has repeatedly warned that its coronavirus bump was temporary. Still, the streaming pioneer’s rip-roaring results this year had quieted sceptics of its debt-driven growth strategy.

Analysts said the shutdown of cinemas and dearth of new television shows or live sports had pushed audiences further towards video streaming as their main source of at-home entertainment. 
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Pivotal Research last week raised their price targets for Netflix stock. Benjamin Swinburne at Morgan Stanley cited a “virtuous cycle” in which Netflix keeps growing subscribers, allowing it to spend more money on programming, thereby luring new customers. 
Netflix, which had previously issued billions of dollars a year in debt to fund a content splurge, told shareholders on Tuesday that its “need for external financing is diminishing” and that it did not plan to tap debt markets this year.

Revenues in the quarter ending in September jumped 23 per cent from the same period last year to $6.4bn, just above analysts’ forecasts. Net income rose to $790m, from $665m a year ago.
Netflix and its peers across Hollywood have been hampered by the pandemic, which shuttered production for most of the spring and summer. 
The company on Tuesday said it had made “good progress” on restarting production, having started filming the next season of the science-fiction horror series Stranger Things, and the film Red Notice, starring Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot. Netflix expects to complete shooting hundreds of productions by the end of the year.

“All men are pick-up artists, all Parisians have extramarital affairs, all shopkeepers are unpleasant, and all the French have names that make you want to wear a beret and carry a baguette under your arm,” the 31-year-old went on. In the broadcast room of Europe 1 radio, howls of laughter, not anger, ensued.
Emily — played by Lily Collins in the series created by Darren Star of Sex and the City — is an ambitious young woman sent from Chicago by a marketing company to explain the wonders of social media to the hidebound French executives of its Paris subsidiary — and to wear an ever-changing array of expensive outfits. She speaks no French.
French reviews have torn the show apart, criticising the fantastical caricatures of Parisian people and places. It made Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s 2001 popular romantic comedy The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain look like a 90-minute documentary, Mr Chameroy remarked. Emily, who does not venture out of the wealthy arrondissements, even finds her first lover when she is picked up by a professor of semiotics in the Café de Flore, where Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were regulars.
“‘Emily in Wonderland’ might be a better title for this Netflix show,” said French television presenter Marjorie Paillon. “It’s a Paris that does not exist, just as the New York in Sex and the City wasn’t one that New Yorkers recognised. It’s soooo pre-Covid. It’s so 2000, it’s not 2020.”

The show, released on October 2, has nevertheless been the most-watched show on Netflix in France for the past four days. While more French people binge-watch it, no angry transatlantic culture war has erupted. Instead, viewers have welcomed it as light relief in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, economic

		and geopolitical disasters dominating the news. 
“I wasn’t annoyed for a second,” said Julia Benke, a 32-year-old Parisian corporate lawyer. “In fact it gave me the urge to see the city again in a new light. I was hooked from the first episode. It’s very girly . . . I spend all day thinking about serious things, and this is a distraction. We need things to make us smile. In the time of Covid, we don’t need more to stress us out.” 
Gregory Messina, a US literary agent based in Paris, said the series had crammed in every possible cliché — good and bad — that Americans had in their minds about the French and their capital city, but he admitted: “Without being particularly good, it’s very watchable.”
For Mr Messina, the clichés “are just so exaggerated: the woman who instead of having lunch will smoke a cigarette: Emily stepping in dog shit outside her front door while the chic woman with the dog stands there perfectly dressed . . . And we viewers just keep thinking [dogs apart] how clean the city looks. They must clean every street before they start filming.”
He is not the only Parisian to have remarked on the programme’s glamorous portrayal of a city apparently given over to art shows, fashion parades and elegant dinners. Emily never takes the Métro. She is caught up in no violent clashes between gilets jaunes anti-establishment protesters and the police. She never encounters a homeless migrant camping out next to the Périphérique, the Paris ring road. Instead, one of her Instagram posts is “liked” by Brigitte Macron from the Elysée Palace.
The stereotypes are applied as consistently to the American characters — bad sex, bad food, no culture — as to the French. Judging by his new passport, Emily’s Chicago boyfriend has never been abroad. The self and selfie-obsessed Emily is dismissed as ringarde (vulgar) and a plouc (a hick) by her snooty French colleagues and accused of political correctness. 
“You are more like the prude police,” says her bitter French boss Sylvie when Emily questions the wisdom of a perfume advertisement using a naked female Serbian model walking across the Pont Alexandre III to admiring gazes from male spectators. “I’m a woman,” says Sylvie, “not a feminist.”
Many viewers have acknowledged the clichés about Parisians contain some doses of truth — whether the subject is long lunches, arriving late at the office, or the French belief that the Americans “live to work”, while they themselves “work to live”. Nor do many dispute the comparisons drawn between the ever-smiling Emily and her cynical, world-weary French interlocutors, or the frustrated comment from Mindy, Emily’s Chinese friend in Paris, that in recalcitrant France, “Everything is ‘pas possible!’”

Bad Boy Billionaires, which depicts the scandals surrounding a number of Indian tycoons, was subject to repeated lawsuits by the protagonists ahead of its original release date in early September. Netflix was forced to suspend the show after two of the industrialists secured court orders staying its release.
The streaming company finally unveiled three of four episodes on Monday after a court in the Indian state of Bihar vacated the stay order filed by Subrata Roy, founder of the Sahara India Pariwar conglomerate. Mr Roy had been jailed for two years for contempt of court.
The as-yet unaired episode examines the case of Ramalinga Raju, whose software company Satyam was behind a $1bn accounting scandal. It is still subject to a stay order issued by a court in the city of Hyderabad, which Netflix continues to contest. 
While the suspension dealt a blow to Netflix, the ensuing controversy has only served to drum up further interest in the show. Bad Boy Billionaires is one of Netflix’s most ambitious documentary productions in India, as the US company ramps up original content for one of its most promising markets.
It’s welcome that this documentary has finally been able to be shown, but India's legal system is still misused for vexatious cases from the billionaire class 
The four-part series is billed as an “investigative docuseries [that] explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up — and ultimately brought down — India’s most infamous tycoons”.
Also featured are Vijay Mallya, a fugitive liquor magnate, and celebrity jeweller Nirav Modi, who is being held in a UK jail. Both fled to London after being accused of defrauding public sector banks and are fighting extradition to India. Mr Mallya and Mr Modi deny allegations of wrongdoing.
The messy court battles have drawn attention to the power and sway that the embattled tycoons continue to hold, particularly in their ability to leverage India’s labyrinthine network of courts to their advantage.

“It’s welcome that this documentary has finally been able to be shown, but India's legal system is still misused for vexatious cases from the billionaire class far too often for comfort,” said James Crabtree, author of The Billionaire Raj and a former Financial Times journalist, who is interviewed in the series.
Mr Roy, whose Sahara empire included real estate, media and retail arms, was jailed in connection with a case involving a $4bn convertible bond issue found illegal by the Indian courts. He left prison in 2016.
In a statement, Sahara hit out at what it called an “ill-motivated, incorrect, misleading documentary depicted through some disgruntled people who [hold] personal grudges.” Sahara added that it has filed criminal cases against Netflix, the show's producers and directors.
Mr Raju was behind one of the biggest accounting scandals in Indian history. He admitted in 2009 to inflating revenues at Satyam, and was sentenced to seven years in 2015 but is no longer in jail.

She might add that leaders have redoubled their emphasis on such values since the pandemic disrupted the office-based community, flinging most of its members into uncertain homeworking exile, there to worry about their future health and careers.
Meyer and her co-author Reed Hastings, founder of Netflix, make clear, though, that family is a faulty model for ambitious, growth-hungry businesses such as the video-streaming and media group. 
A better, though equally hackneyed, metaphor is that of the professional sports team, Hastings explains, “working to create strong feelings of commitment, cohesion and camaraderie, while continually making tough decisions to ensure the best player is manning each post”.
The slogan “we are a team, not a family” crops up at the halfway point of No Rules Rules. It is central to the image of Netflix that emerges from the book: a group of highly skilled, highly motivated, hard-edged professionals whom Hastings and his lieutenants trust to perform well within a radical, no-rules corporate culture. If that performance starts to flag, they know they will be dropped.
The way Netflix works has fascinated Silicon Valley since Hastings released its 125-slide internal “Culture Deck” on the internet 11 years ago. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook described it as possibly “the most important document ever to come out of the Valley”. Yet the fact that few other companies have been able to apply the whole template successfully is one reason why this book exists. 
Recommended
No Rules Rules takes the form of an exchange between Hastings and Meyer, an academic and expert on business culture. She injects a tiny note of scepticism, and some chunky references to relevant research, to offset Hastings’ faintly superior air of “do not try this at home” superiority, as they walk readers through the process of establishing a “high-talent-density workplace”.
As an example of the executive memoir-manual, the book is colder than another top-down view of West Coast knowledge work — Creativity, Inc, Ed Catmull’s endearing 2014 trial-and-error account of how he and others built Pixar, the animation studio. It is also significantly less self-deprecating.
The question for Netflix is how well its unique principles will hold up as it continues to expand globally
Hastings does acknowledge failures and mis-steps. In fact, he sets up an earlier venture, a software business called Pure, as though it was a clumsy anti-Netflix — rules-bound, hierarchical and secretive. Yet as Meyer points out, Pure’s annual revenue doubled four years in a row and it was ultimately sold for $750m, providing Hastings with the seed-funding for Netflix.
Hastings also describes his humiliating attempt to phase out Netflix’s DVD-by-mail service, by creating Qwikster in 2011. But he turns the debacle into an epiphany, which prompted the group to start soliciting dissent from staff who had previously been afraid to contradict the founder.
More valuable is the way in which Hastings and Meyer highlight the paradoxes hinted at in the book’s title. That famous slide deck is one. More than 100 pages of principles were required to establish a culture based on freedom. Those principles, as the Qwikster fiasco demonstrated, need constant tweaking and polishing, while freedom is only available to those who also demonstrate responsibility — the second part of an “F&R” mantra proclaimed by all Netflix staff. 
The question for Netflix is how well such principles will hold up as it continues to expand globally. As Hastings told the Financial Times in a recent interview, when asked why he did not step back from his co-chief executive role, “I don’t feel we have entertained the world!”
Recommended
It is here where Meyer, whose last book The Culture Map was a guide to cross-border working, comes into her own. She and Hastings make clear that applying some of the original Netflix ideals across its global footprint, from the upfront Dutch to the more diffident Japanese, was almost as great a challenge as sourcing suitable programming for its diverse customers around the world. 
Some of the lessons they draw for other multinational businesses may seem obvious — “Adapt . . . your delivery and your reaction to the culture you’re working with to get the results that you need”, for example. But that does not make such lessons any easier to apply, as close-knit families reluctantly admitting new members know only too well.

The AT&T-owned network won 30 Emmy awards, including the coveted Best Drama Series category for Succession and Best Limited Series for Watchmen, in an event held virtually and without a live audience for the first time ever due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
With the end last year of Game of Thrones and an exodus of executives including longtime chief Richard Plepler, observers had questioned whether HBO under new ownership could continue to churn out top shows. 
That question was answered as the critically acclaimed programmes Watchmen and Succession each won four awards, helping HBO nab more trophies than any other network for the second year in a row. 
HBO faced stiff competition from Netflix, which had scored a record 160 nominations this year for TV’s highest honours. The pair have duelled in the past few years, leading the pack in nominations and setting up a battle of HBO’s careful curation versus Netflix’s volume of programming. 
Recommended
In Hollywood, the Emmys have a commercial impact because winning awards enhances a studio’s standing with top talent. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, told investors earlier this year that there was a “business benefit” to winning awards because it helped “win deals that we couldn’t have otherwise won”.
Coming in third in terms of awards was Pop TV, the Viacom-owned TV channel that airs Schitt’s Creek, a Canadian comedy that garnered broad popularity after Netflix picked up old seasons of it in 2017. The series won seven awards on Sunday, sweeping the comedy categories. 
This year’s ceremony was constrained by the pandemic. Instead of lavish red carpets and hundreds of stars packed into a room together, Jimmy Kimmel hosted from a largely empty Staples Center in Los Angeles while nominees appeared via video links from their preferred locations around the globe. 
The ceremony took place weeks ahead of a crucial US presidential election against a backdrop of nearly 200,000 American deaths due to the coronavirus crisis, a crippling economic

		and historic uprisings over racial inequality. 
These tensions were evident during the programme, with several winners urging viewers to vote and host Jimmy Kimmel joking that the show was being filmed without a live studio audience because “this isn’t a MAGA rally”. 
Analysts have questioned whether HBO, which has made a name for itself as a producer of selective, high-quality series, can transform into a broader Netflix-style service as streamers flood the market with new shows. 
While HBO has continued to prosper creatively, its owner WarnerMedia has failed to gain much traction with efforts to compete directly with Netflix. 
WarnerMedia this year launched a new streaming service, HBO Max, which packages HBO’s programming with that of the Warner Bros studio and the Turner networks for $15 a month. 
Take-up has been relatively modest since the launch in May: although more than 23m existing HBO subscribers can access the HBO Max service for free, but the company said that as of July only around 4m users had activated the streaming platform. 
By comparison Netflix added 10m subscribers in the second quarter, taking its number of global subscribers to close to 200m.

https://www.ft.com/content/7d66dd4c-440c-44d3-a234-39346fb69a91,Alex Barker,Netflix to take crown for spending on films and television ,2020-09-14,03:00:50,"Netflix is expected to outspend all its major rivals on entertainment content this year, as the pandemic increases the gap in firepower between streaming services and advertising-reliant broadcasters around the world. 
Research by Ampere Analysis for the Financial Times estimates that the US streaming service’s spending on films and programming will rise by $3bn to $13.6bn in 2020, outstripping its nearest rivals ViacomCBS, Disney and NBCUniversal when purchases of sports rights are excluded. 
Netflix’s bumper outlay is part of a record-setting year for Hollywood, where expenditure on original shows and the rights to old content is still expected to increase to new highs in 2020, despite the economic downturn and production delays. 
Daniel Gadher, an analyst at Ampere, forecasts $206bn spending in total this year, a figure that covers new productions, rights purchases, and sports. “We’ve seen a content boom since 2009. The rapid growth is slowing but we still expect it to be positive with growth in spending increasingly being driven by streaming platforms,” he said. 
But because of the pandemic and delays to production, fewer shows have been commissioned this year, particularly in television drama. Mr Gadher expected to create a shortfall of potentially up to one in 10 new scripted shows. 
Big US media groups that merged with rivals during the 2018-19 wave of dealmaking are, through combined firepower, managing to keep within touching distance of Netflix’s spending. 
ViacomCBS, which owns Nickelodeon and the Paramount studio, is expected to spend around $13.5bn on commissioning or licensing content, Disney around $11bn and NBCUniversal close to $9.5bn. 
But the severe hit to advertising has dented the budget of broadcasters in Europe, with spending by Mediaset, ProSiebenSat. 1, RTL and ITV either remaining flat or falling this year, according to Ampere. 
Public broadcasters are also increasingly outgunned by their US rivals, who are moving into their national markets with streaming services. 
The BBC is expected to devote around $2.1bn to entertainment content in 2020, less than a sixth of that spent by Netflix worldwide, while Germany’s ARD/ZDF is estimated to spend around $4.2bn. 
Recommended
Although it has been rapidly expanding its own productions, such as Stranger Things or Cobra Kai, Netflix still spends the bulk of its annual budget on acquiring films and shows. Around $4.4bn of its $13.6bn spending is on original content, according to Ampere.
The streaming services pipeline of titles has been funded in recent years by borrowing. The company has long-term debt of $15.3bn. While the long lead time for premium drama has protected its 2020 schedule, it expects delays will affect the release schedule for its big titles next year. 
“There is no question Netflix has a meaningful content advantage and its ability to produce programming on a global basis adds to its advantage,” said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, in a recent note. “That said, the amount of Hollywood content being created today is still a fraction of what it would be pre-pandemic, which is creating increased concern for the content pipeline.”

“This,” my guest blurts out. “This is a problem.”
Reed Hastings is the billionaire founder of Netflix, the crusher of Blockbuster, and the one who turned Hollywood upside down with streaming tech. But, right now, his main concern is pizza.
Slightly out of shot, Hastings is on his knees with a Roccbox portable oven (“it’s my new toy!”). I can hear the clatter of the pizza peel, a metal implement roughly the shape of a beach bat. My screen looks to a garden just outside Silicon Valley, the horizon only interrupted by a couple of trees. Hastings’ white sneakers peek into view, soles facing up to the misty sky.
Scrape, scrape. Clack.
“Argh! It’s stuck, it’s sticking,” he says, without sounding too panicked. A moment later, he pops back into view with a broad grin. He is wearing a sage-green shirt and has freshly combed hair.
“So it is too early in the morning for pizza, clearly,” he says (it’s mid-afternoon for me in London). “Just how a brilliant fried egg can turn into a scrambled egg, we may be dealing with a scrambled pizza here.”
Hastings lets out a long, wheezy laugh. He is no chef, but he is game. With a laid-back air and a goatee that almost pre-dates the internet, Hastings is one of the Valley’s improbable survivors, and now the miscast impresario behind a Hollywood institution. A techie who admits to seeing the world in “numbers and algorithms”, the 59-year-old hails from the generation of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. In the mid-80s he served coffee at Symbolics.com — the world’s first dotcom — and tried to patent a computer “foot mouse” at Stanford (a device as daft as it sounds). He eventually made a small fortune with Pure, a listed software business, while still in his thirties. Then came Netflix.
It is hard to overstate the change that company symbolises for Hollywood and the old media empires. Netflix launched in 1997 as a service offering DVD hire by post, aiming to bring internet savvy to the ever-frustrating, damn-the-late-fees world of video rental. Given a new mission by Hastings about a decade ago, it has been in the driving seat of an era-defining streaming revolution. For the media incumbents of the old world — spinning profits through advert breaks, cinema release windows and cable bundles — all that was solid began to melt into Netflix.
It could easily have been snuffed out by Blockbuster or lost in the dotcom crash. Then there was Hastings’ hapless attempt in 2011 to split the business and create Qwikster, an aborted move that combined a price rise, a rebrand and a crime against spelling. Some basic foresight from big media might have also thwarted Netflix’s streaming ambitions; instead rivals licensed its shows, taking money for old rope. Most of them are now flailing in its wake.
Netflix has amassed almost 200m subscribers worldwide. It made its mark with series such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. But its $15bn annual content budget is now bankrolling half of Hollywood. It is not just movies such as Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman or Extraction, a thriller watched by 99m in its first month, but countless hours of middling fare to suit any taste. Netflix is borrowing more (long-term debts of $15bn), its profits are relatively thin (pre-tax profits of $2.1bn last year), and the pandemic hit production. But that doesn’t worry Wall Street. Even crises seem to make it stronger.
“Covid could have been an internet virus taking down all the routers of the world and our business would be out and restaurants would be in,” Hastings says. “And instead tragically it is a biological one, so everybody is locked up and we had the greatest growth in the first half of this year that we ever had.” With a market capitalisation of around $230bn, it has been vying with Walt Disney since March for the title of the world’s most valuable entertainment group.
“Can you see OK?” Hastings is back in his kitchen working dough for “crust number two”. The room is spacious but unflashy, with a timber-beamed ceiling that seems as high as a church.
My own attempt, a homemade dough topped with goat’s cheese, spinach and dried chilli, looks unexpectedly tasty. “Bellissima!” cries Hastings. Given events, I’m too sheepish to start eating properly, and I push my little Turkish shepherd’s salad, dressed with pomegranate molasses, out of view.
“So,” Hastings asks, as he prepares to spread tomato sauce with his fingers. “Did you read the book?”
In No Rules Rules, Hastings admits to his “general incompetence at people management”, hiding his virginity at college, and sobbing before Netflix staff. But this book isn’t a confessional. Part memoir, part business manual, it alternates between Hastings and co-author Erin Meyer, a professor at Insead, who interviewed dozens of Netflix staff. What it explains — and debates — is Netflix’s smash-the-conventions culture, which Hastings sees as central to its extraordinary success. To outsiders it might also capture the libertarian spirit, and dark edges of dystopia, that mark our internet age.
Netflix hates rules. Staff face no limit on holiday, nor do they need expenses approved. Everyone is deliberately paid more than their market rate — much more. “Brilliant jerks” are sacked. Big risk-taking is encouraged. Openness and transparency — “sunshining” — applies to almost everything, at least internally. Market-sensitive earnings data is shared with 700 staff (most companies treat them like nuclear codes). Individual salaries are searchable too. It is, in theory, the antithesis of bureaucracy described by the sociologist Max Weber: “Nothing but those little cogs, little men clinging to little jobs”. At Netflix “F&R” — freedom and responsibility — is the creed.

But there is a hard edge. This company’s mantra is being “a team, not a family”. So good employees are subject to the so-called “keeper test”, where adequate performance is rewarded with “a generous severance package”. Radical candour extends to near-constant discussion of whether employees are a Netflix fit. It smacks of nonstop group therapy, with the risk of eviction at any moment, pour décourager les autres. “If your people choose to abuse the freedom you give them, you need to fire them and fire them loudly,” Hastings writes.
The book airs plenty of criticism. “Hypermasculine . . . and downright aggressive” was co-author Meyer’s first reaction to Netflix’s culture. But for all the self-reflection, readers still might feel something is amiss. The system has an unfalsifiable quality, an answer to every flaw. But all systems have a fundamental weakness, don’t they?
“Well, in a classic theory it won’t really be seen to be a good system until it has been practised for a decade or two after me,” Hastings says, as he flicks basil on to the mozzarella. We might have a long wait. Hastings made his longtime deputy Ted Sarandos “co-CEO” in July, but pledged to stay at Netflix until at least 2030.
Out on the porch, Hastings explains that the Netflix approach suits places where innovation trumps the need for consistency or safety. “At Netflix it has really been about, you know, tolerating some level of chaos and error, so that you stimulate more innovation . . . but then the question is, as we went from 200 people to 500 to 1,000 to 5,000, how do you not have the chaos overwhelm you?”
Netflix’s safety net is an indefinable thing: judgment. It’s fine for bets to go wrong so long as they were pursued in a Netflix way. But that, of course, is entirely subjective. Doesn’t it just allow the powerful within the company to define what success is to suit them?
“If you just say no rules, then it is kind of anarchy,” he replies. “The question is, can you manage through values and context, so everyone is doing the right thing without central co-ordination? It’s the jazz metaphor versus the orchestra.”
I make little headway raising other potential problems. Eventually I put a word to him that several ex-staff, some of whom left traumatised by the intense Netflix culture, raised with me unprompted. Doesn’t the place have the ring of a cult?
“In religions, the danger is subsuming yourself into the greater whole, or the basis of Leninism, or something like that,” Hastings says, shaking his head. “But we are strongly around the individual and having each individual have agency and power. So it is probably more like some admiration, which is nice, rather than the other part of culting, which is you don’t get to think independently.” When Hastings’ pizza emerges, after just a couple of minutes, the crust looks well-risen and tasty. “The Covid adaptation to the FT lunch,” he says. “Usually so elegant. But we’ve done quirky.”
Hastings hails from a family of achievers. His polymath great-grandfather Alfred Loomis made an unlikely fortune during the Wall Street crash, then invented a navigation forerunner to GPS. Hastings, though, describes himself as “a pretty average kid with no particular talent”. He grew up in the Boston suburbs, joined Marine officer training, then dropped out, heading to Swaziland with the Peace Corps. After MIT turned him down, his break was a place on Stanford’s computer science graduate programme.
In business he fell into being a “people leader” without many people skills. He acknowledges a “rough” transition. Marc Randolph, the co-founder of Netflix, has compared him to Spock from Star Trek and, in his book on the early Netflix, describes the unforgettable one-to-one meeting where he was ousted as chief executive. Hastings walked in, straddled a chair, then laid out Randolph’s weaknesses in a PowerPoint presentation.
“I would probably, kind of, not use PowerPoint now,” admits Hastings. “But there is an overarching thing: it is difficult to take your co-founder and then slide them out. I wanted to have a really clear rationale and explain why it was right for the business. And at that time I thought in PowerPoint.
“It is not an unrepresentative symbol,” he adds, as I concentrate on cutting my pizza without it flying off the plate. “I was big on clarity of thought, you know, on being precise.”
Hastings sees Netflix as the “least lucky” part of his career. He leaned on Sarandos as the “entertainment savant”. When Sarandos paid $100m for House of Cards, he didn’t consult Hastings beforehand. Hastings proudly takes “very few decisions”.

It begs the question: why keep going? Why not become chairman rather than co-CEO? “I don’t feel we have entertained the world!” declares Hastings. “The simple answer is lack of success, internationally.” Beyond the US, Hastings calls Netflix “small fry”. Most of its growth is outside America, and its business model depends on keeping that expansion going. “We are very much still in challenger status,” he says.
Netflix is ramping up local production (from the worldwide Spanish hit Casa De Papel to Indian originals such as Sacred Games). Increasingly, too, it is recreating the fare — occasionally great, mostly forgettable — of traditional television, just delivered in a different form.
Netflix’s revolution might be more like Lampedusa’s masterpiece The Leopard, where everything had to change so things could stay the same.
“I could argue with that, but I know what you mean,” replies Hastings. “It’s not TikTok. We aren’t creating a whole new form of entertainment . . . we are still making The Crown. It’s very traditional in many ways.”
Yet his method is the opposite of that of the influence-hungry, continent-spanning media moguls of old. Netflix has no ads. No live sport (“there is no long-term profitability, nothing defensible”). And definitely no news — “it is not smart to dabble”. Netflix already has enough trouble with meddlesome autocrats. It has censored a handful of shows and recently cancelled a Turkish production because authorities objected to a gay character.
Given the social influence of drama, I ask why he once said Netflix wasn’t “in the truth to power business”? Hastings pauses. “It isn’t the best phrase I have ever used,” he replies. “What I meant is that we are not in hard news . . . We’re entertainment. You are right that there is a lot of truth in entertainment.”
We move to the bigger storms battering Silicon Valley. First I raise the US-China tensions and the Balkanisation of the internet. “We are profoundly globalist,” comes the reply. “We are unrepentant.” But when I mention Donald Trump’s move to ban TikTok, he ducks: “I haven’t followed it that closely”.
In the late-1990s, when Google was still a small start-up, Hastings’ career took a detour: lobbying for Silicon Valley as president of TechNet.
Has Big Tech become too big for the good of society? “I don’t know,” says Hastings. “I don’t see bigness as the fundamental issue.”
When I mention that Netflix left the Apple App Store in 2018 — avoiding having to share subscription revenues — Hastings interrupts to say: “We continued to grow!” Well, I reply, that might be because Netflix was big enough to do so, while most others are not. “As tech grows there will be fights and arguments and probably abuses,” he half-concedes.
Hastings has long stopped eating, and never took a drink. Our time is running out. We end by discussing the US’s summer of protests. As Hastings talks about social injustice, I recall his mini-forays into politics, from tech lobbying to spending millions promoting charter schools in California. Would he consider going into politics?
“I’ve realised I like speaking truth. I am like an aspiring intellectual that way. That’s the opposite of the skillset, right? The leaders who get elected are leaders who are facile or a liar.”
“Surely it is time for a disruptive force,” I reply, which prompts another wheezy Hastings chuckle. “Do you remember that old New Yorker cartoon?” he asks. “There is a movie theatre with a long line in front of the title: The Reassuring Lie. Then there is The Inconvenient Truth — and there are two people standing in line.”
After he has gone, bidding me farewell with a chirpy smile, I tuck into my secret salad and look up the cartoon.
Hastings, it turns out, remembered it slightly wrong. It was in the Christian Science Monitor. And there is actually nobody queueing for The Inconvenient Truth.

The Supreme Court rebuffed the streaming group’s efforts to clear the way for the series to air after one of the disgraced billionaires depicted — Subrata Roy, founder of the Sahara India Pariwar conglomerate, who spent two years in jail — successfully secured an order against it using his name from a regional court. 
The top court ordered Netflix to take its petition back to the lower courts in the Indian state of Bihar. Another regional court in Hyderabad has separately stayed the show’s release at the behest of Ramalinga Raju, whose software company Satyam was behind a $1bn accounting scandal. 
Netflix, which declined to comment, now faces a potentially difficult battle through India’s lower courts to clear the way for the show, which had been due to air on Wednesday. It has removed the trailer for the series from its website.
The case is a significant setback to the streaming giant as it seeks to expand its footprint in India, where it launched in 2016. Bad Boy Billionaires: India marked one of its boldest forays into documentary content in the country. 
The four-part series is billed as an “investigative docuseries [that] explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up — and ultimately brought down – India’s most infamous tycoons”.
It has faced multiple legal challenges from the tycoons featured in the show, who include fugitive liquor magnate Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, a celebrity jeweller accused of being at the centre of an alleged $2bn fraud. 
Recommended
Both Mr Mallya and Mr Modi fled to London after becoming embroiled in separate scandals, with both accused of defrauding public sector banks. Both the once-high flying tycoons are fighting their extradition back to India, and Mr Modi is being held in jail in the UK. Both deny allegations of wrongdoing.
Mr Roy, the flamboyant founder of a business empire that included real estate, media and retail was jailed for two years for contempt of court in connection with a case involving a $4bn convertible bond issue found illegal by the Indian courts. He left prison in 2016.
Mr Raju was behind what was then the biggest accounting scandal in Indian history after admitting in 2009 to inflating revenues at Satyam. He was sentenced to seven years in 2015 but is no longer in jail.

Drive-in films have become much more popular while social-distancing measures are in place. The Secret Cinema showing of the Netflix sci-fi drama series Stranger Things will take place in a disused downtown Los Angeles car park. About 26 cars will be able to drive around different locations to watch scenes from the series that will also be acted out around them. 
The Stranger Things show, which will run throughout October and will cost $59 a ticket, follows Secret Cinema’s success creating a version of the series for audiences on foot in London last year, which attracted 100,000 visitors during its six-week run.
Chief executive Max Alexander said the business had experimented with a normal drive-in format at Goodwood House in the UK this summer. It made £308,926 in ticket sales, he said, but it “lacked the romance”.
Secret Cinema, whose shows normally cost in the region of $10m to put on, is known for hosting film screenings in unusual locations where audience members walk around sets encountering actors playing characters from the film.
The high level of audience participation and the need to sell at least 80 per cent of tickets per show to break even has meant that its events have been impossible with social-distancing measures in place.
“What we do is put 5,000 people in a room with a film and they wander around and really participate . . . so it was very clear we could not put a show on,” Mr Alexander said.
Thousands of events companies have found their business models fundamentally challenged by the pandemic. In the UK, Plasa, an industry trade association, has warned that 600,000 jobs could be lost in the sector unless the government intervenes.
Recommended
Before the pandemic, Secret Cinema had been pursuing international expansion. It opened its first show outside the UK — a version of the James Bond film Casino Royale — in Shanghai last year.
In the year to the end of December 2019, it reported a £4.2m pre-tax loss on revenues of £15.8m.
Netflix, which is funding the project alongside the Spanish production company Fever, said it was testing the water to see what audiences thought.
Before lockdowns began around the world, prompting a huge rise in demand for film and TV streaming, Netflix had been investing in physical cinemas with its acquisition of the Paris Theatre in New York and the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles.
In May, the Mail on Sunday reported that Netflix had also been in the running to buy the US cinema chain Regal before Cineworld took it in a £2.4bn deal that was completed in 2018.

In an example of the challenges the streaming service faces as it expands worldwide, Netflix decided to abandon a Turkish production rather than yield to government complaints over its perceived immorality. 
Ece Yorenc, a Turkish screenwriter who wrote the script for the planned Netflix series If Only, revealed that her drama was cancelled last week on the eve of filming because the government refused to grant a licence.
“Due to a gay character, permission to film the series was not granted and this is very frightening for the future,” she told the Turkish film news website Altyazi Fasikul. 
Netflix on Monday insisted it remained “deeply committed” to the country’s creative community after rumours that it was halting all productions in Turkey, an important growth market and creative hub. The company said it had several original Turkish series in the works, with more to come in future.
Do we have to bless everything Netflix makes, find it proper and sanctify it?
The decision to pull If Only is a significant moment for the US streamer, which has championed a diverse slate of shows as it has expanded to almost 200m subscribers around the world, most of whom are outside the US. 
Netflix has complied with nine government “takedown orders” since 2015, removing specific titles from its service in Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Germany and New Zealand. Stopping productions is a rare step, but one that might become more common as Netflix develops more local content for non-US markets. 
Mahir Unal, a spokesman for Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), acknowledged on Sunday that authorities had raised issues with some Netflix scripts. 
“Must we collectively apologise to Netflix?” he said. “What do they want from us? Do we have to bless everything Netflix makes, find it proper and sanctify it? Is there no subject where we have a right to raise reservations?”
Ilhan Tasci, a member of Turkey’s main opposition party, who sits on the board of the government’s broadcasting regulator, condemned the interference in a private artistic production and accused the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan of “trying to impose [its] world view on the whole of society”.
“They want all of Turkey, a country of 83m people, to think like them,” he told the Financial Times. 
The dispute comes at a time when human rights campaigners have warned of deteriorating LGBT rights in the country.
Turkey was once seen as a relatively safe haven for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people from nations across the Middle East. But in recent years, gay pride marches that once attracted thousands of participants have been cancelled. Senior officials from Mr Erdogan’s party and from government institutions frequently rail against homosexuality. 
Recommended
Netflix has been ramping up production in Turkey, where it had 1.5m subscribers at the end of 2019, and If Only was one of three new original series commissioned this year. 
The company’s first original Turkish series, The Protector — a fantasy drama about an Istanbul shopkeeper who discovers he is descended from an ancient secret order charged with guarding the city — was watched by 10m subscribers. 
If Only tells the story of Reyhan, an unhappily married mother of twins, who is suddenly transported back 30 years to the night her husband proposed.
Ms Yorenc said that there were no gay sex scenes, nor even any physical contact, between the gay man and any other characters. 
Confronted with the government’s objections, Netflix executives concluded that they would rather cancel the entire production rather than write out the gay character, according to a person familiar with the row.

It dabbled with its own content from 2006-2008 when its Red Envelope Entertainment division acquired rights to more than 120 films including Palm d’Or winner 4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days. But it wasn’t until House of Cards in 2013 that it started to get serious about original content, in a move that seemed audacious and even overambitious at the time.
We all know what’s happened since then, including appearances in golden Oscar envelopes. Under lockdown, I’ve been seeking out new Netflix series and movies more eagerly than anything on terrestrial television, for the first time.
So Thursday’s announcement — that Ted Sarandos, who has overseen content during the company’s massive investment period, was being promoted to co-chief executive alongside Reed Hastings — is really no surprise. “Ted drove the revolution in our content strategy,” said Mr Hastings.
It is a milestone though, marking Netflix as a major creator as well as distributor, and a huge competitor for Hollywood. Another landmark of 200m subscribers beckons, as it reported adding 10m in the second quarter to reach 193m. It shares are down nearly 7 per cent today after it predicted only 2.5m additions in its September quarter because “growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions”. 
Lex has a different take on future distribution growth disappointing: the astounding subscriber gains of the first two quarters of 2020 may simply be future 2021 and 2022 converts who joined ahead of schedule. As Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates puts it: “If you haven’t subscribed to Netflix during lockdown, the chances are you never will.”
1. TikTok’s last US dance?The White House is considering putting TikTok on a blacklist that would effectively prevent Americans from using the popular video app, as one option to prevent China from obtaining personal data via the social media platform. The move would mean Apple and other app store owners could no longer provide updates. According to Ed Luce’s 13-year-old daughter, TikTokers have already figured a way round the potential ban. They would simply re-register their TikTok addresses in Canada. 
2. FBI probes Twitter hack The FBI and New York state have launched investigations into Wednesday’s unprecedented security breach. The Great Twitter Hack of 2020 has exposed the precarity of our online existence, Richard Waters writes. Twitter is also under pressure to grow and diversify its revenues, according to Lex.
3. Ericsson’s 5G momentThe Swedish telecoms equipment maker reported on Friday that second-quarter sales rose, despite the pandemic, sending its shares 10 per cent higher to a level not seen in more than a decade. Lex says Huawei being squeezed out of 5G makes the market virtually a duopoly for Ericsson and Nokia.

Instacart sues ‘copycat’ CornershopGrocery delivery app Instacart is suing Cornershop, a rival grocery app majority owned by Uber, for what it alleges was a “brazen” theft of its intellectual property. In a court filing, Instacart accused Cornershop, one of the largest delivery apps in Latin America, of stealing its product images, descriptions and pricing by scraping the details from the Instacart app.
5. The changing (animal) faces of video games The first decades of gaming offered a cartoonish menagerie of animal heroes, including Crash Bandicoot, Donkey Kong and Sonic the Hedgehog. But as games have become more serious, these fun figures have mostly gone out of fashion, to be replaced by more realistic creatures that reflect environmental concerns, writes Tom Faber.
Talking of cartoonish characters, a cardboard cut-out version of Mario features in a new game for the Nintendo Switch released today. Bloomberg has a full analysis of the Paper Mario franchise and says its sixth iteration in The Origami King is enjoyable, with clever writing, satisfying gameplay and a vast and beautiful world. But it is by no means a traditional role-playing game and that has upset some players.

The streaming group cautioned investors that subscriber growth would slow in the second half of the year, after enjoying the bump from lockdown life in recent months. Netflix expects to add only 2.5m new subscribers in the July to September quarter, which would be its weakest showing in years. 
The company also announced that Ted Sarandos would be promoted to co-chief executive alongside Reed Hastings. Mr Sarandos had overseen content during the company’s massive investment period.
“Ted drove the revolution in our content strategy,” said Mr Hastings, adding that he did “not expect much to change” in terms of daily operations at Netflix.

With people staying home to control coronavirus as it spread across the world this year, Netflix had by June added almost as many subscribers as it did in all of last year. The company added 26m subscribers in the first half of 2020; in 2019 its subscriber base grew by 28m.
It lost subscribers in June, however, according to a graph in Netflix’s quarterly letter shareholders. “As we expected . . . growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions,” Netflix said in the letter.
Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If you haven’t subscribed to Netflix during lockdown, the chances are you never will.
“While Netflix is still the biggest fish in the tank, if it wants to keep it that way, there is work to be done.” 
The company has previously fuelled a content splurge with junk bonds, borrowing billions as it sought to disrupt Hollywood with original movies and TV shows. 
But Netflix does not expect to tap debt markets again this year. “Our need for external financing is diminishing,” it said.

As coronavirus has eased in Europe, Netflix has resumed production in countries including Germany, France, UK and Italy. However in the US, where the pandemic is worsening in states such as California, there is “more uncertainty”, Netflix warned. 
With cinemas shut in the US, streaming movies have replaced the typical summer blockbusters that would draw audiences to cinemas. Extraction, an action flick starring Chris Hemsworth, drew 99m household viewers in the four weeks after it made its debut on the service, Netflix said on Thursday. 
The company also highlighted Mindy Kaling’s young adult comedy Never Have I Ever, which lured 40m household viewers in its first four weeks.
Revenues in the quarter ending in June jumped 25 per cent over last year to $6.1bn, meeting analysts’ forecasts. Net income rose to $720m, from $709m a year ago.

https://www.ft.com/content/be04b6b1-d4ef-48d4-a9de-0df596c9345e,Joseph Cotterill,The Zimbabwean romcom and Netflix: ‘Now it’s Africans telling stories’,2020-07-03,19:00:24,"The starting budget was $8,000 in a country where retrieving that kind of cash from a bank is all but impossible and the shooting schedule had to work around constant power cuts and other shortages.
Three years later, Cook Off, a feel-good Zimbabwean romantic comedy, is on the Netflix carousels of millions — a powerful illustration of how the US online streaming giant is expanding in Africa by licensing or producing content that challenges regional stereotypes. 
“No water on set, no electricity . . . If anyone was trying to do it who didn’t live here, they would have stopped on day two or on day three,” said Joe Njagu, the producer of Cook Off, describing how it was made in 2017, just before the military coup that toppled Robert Mugabe as dictator. 
But with its faithful representation of Harare’s suburbs, homegrown Zimbabwean soundtrack and narrative constructed around a reality-TV cooking show, the film offers Netflix viewers a different side of the southern African nation than the political crisis and financial turmoil for which it is often known. 
“A lot of Zimbabweans feel that is not the sum total of who we are — we have so much more in our lives to speak about,” said Tomas Brickhill, Cook Off’s writer and director. “Whatever you might think of Zimbabwe, we also have reality TV.”
The show’s acquisition by Netflix reflects the streaming giant’s emphasis on African-made stories as it tries to become an increasingly big player in the continent’s film and TV industries. “Have you ever had someone tell your story, take your voice and replace your face, until no one else can see or hear you?” a TV spot promoting Netflix’s African content, entitled “Made by Africans, watched by the world”, asked viewers last month.
“Stories from Africa have been told from outside. Now it’s Africans telling stories,” said Dorothy Ghettuba, Netflix’s head of African originals or tailor-made productions. “We are out there and we are scouring the continent for the best stories.” 
Recent South African original productions in particular have included Queen Sono, a spy thriller, and Blood and Water, a Cape Town high-school drama that made Netflix’s US top-10 on its debut in May. “We are seeing that they are resonating all around the world already,” said Ben Amadasun, Netflix’s head of licensing and co-production in Africa, which was responsible for acquiring Cook Off.
The rise of original African programming on Netflix reflects how it has been shifting the majority of its content budget, which analysts estimate will be about $17bn this year, to self-produced or third-party originals in order to outpace producers such as Disney that are launching their own streaming services.
At the same time, Africa is emerging as a streaming market in its own right. Netflix, which began to disclose regional subscriber growth numbers only last year, does not specify the sub-Saharan portion of its 58m customers across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which together comprise its second-biggest market.
But African streaming will reach $1.2bn in revenues by 2025, a sixfold increase on 2019, according to Digital TV Research, an industry forecaster. Netflix alone will have around 5.7m African subscribers by the middle of the decade, it forecasts. 
Netflix’s bet on African content shows that “they also want to be seen to be offering local productions in their key growth markets”, said Simon Murray, principal analyst at Digital TV Research. 
Most of Netflix’s big international streaming rivals do not yet operate in Africa. 
The strongest local streaming service is Showmax, operated by South Africa’s MultiChoice pay-TV empire. More than half of Showmax’s content is locally made and MultiChoice runs a yearly “talent factory” looking for creatives across Africa. It is also increasing investment in local content. A standalone Showmax subscription in South Africa costs R99 ($5.80) a month, the same as a basic Netflix plan in the country. 
One reason for the dominance of traditional pay TV is that all streaming platforms have to deal with severe disparities on the continent in the speed and cost of data as well as a lack of fixed broadband.
According to the UN Economic Commission for Africa, downloading a five-gigabyte film in Ethiopia or the Democratic Republic of Congo can take between 12 and 14 hours, versus just over 11 minutes in Singapore. 
As streaming takes off in Africa, “a lot of that growth will be on mobile broadband” and Netflix will probably sell mobile subscriptions, as it has in India and some Asian markets, said Mr Murray. 
“Eventually in Africa a lot of these platforms will have to form partnerships with mobile operators,” he added — not only to offer mobile plans but to secure distribution and payment systems. 
It also means that the streaming race to acquire African-made series and films has only just begun. “Diversity of genre is critical to us. There are so many genres we want to test out and try,” said Mr Amadasun.
Meanwhile, Mr Njagu and Mr Brickhill are thinking about where Zimbabwe filmmaking will go next, after Cook Off’s Netflix boost showed what was possible. “The next one is going to be bigger and better than Cook Off,” said Mr Njagu. “The only way is up.”

https://www.ft.com/content/e2aef6e5-37d3-4b93-99d5-8964bc6d647b,Alex Barker,The shows must go on: inside Netflix’s race to restart filming,2020-06-18,04:00:37,"Spectacles resting on her face mask, art assistant Marta Navarro looks up at the imposing Franco-era statue and fixes a missing blade to its sword hilt, which the hooded angel clasps to its chest like a cross. Nearby on the set of a reimagined Bank of Spain, foreman Miguel Fuster is touching up the matte gold paint of the foyer’s geometric floor, ready to be prowled by the red‑jumpsuited robbers of Netflix’s La casa de papel (Money Heist). It is a June morning in Madrid at the company’s 237,000 sq ft production hub, and the fifth season of Netflix’s most-watched non-English-language series is taking shape.
The show needs a couple more months of pre‑production work before filming starts. But, with a variety of Covid precautions in place, others are already shooting. The superhero caper El Vecino (The Neighbor) started rolling again in Madrid almost two weeks ago, after holding surreal rehearsals with cast wearing face shields*. A separate production, Sky Rojo (Red Sky), will restart filming next month having quarantined its international cast with nothing to eat but Netflix-arranged deliveries. Over in Barcelona, filming on the drug-trafficking drama Hache has resumed, minus two Italian actors who were written out of their remaining scenes to avoid dragging them back to Spain.
And on the Swedish set of Lisa Langseth’s romantic comedy Love & Anarchy, the directors last month even pulled off what would be near impossible in most of Covid-wracked Europe: a screen kiss (albeit with all the spontaneity of two weeks in actor quarantine). Touching lips are a true screen miracle these days. “There were so many brains around the world turning on this,” laughs Kelly Luegenbiehl, who oversees Netflix’s international productions. 
Set by set, shot by shot, the global entertainment factory that is Netflix is reawakening from its pandemic slumber. Few big broadcasters or studios shut down faster than the streaming company after the risks of coronavirus became clear. Now, as the industry figures out how to operate in this strange new era, few can match its deep pockets and continent-spanning footprint to restart at scale. By the end of September, Netflix hopes to be back to near normal, with more than 20 dramas filming across Europe and the Middle East alone, including The Witcher, Sex Education and Sky Rojo from Álex Pina, creator of La casa de papel. Most are supposed to be streaming on screens everywhere next year — that is, if all goes to plan. 
For Netflix and the whole production industry — from big-budget Hollywood movies such as Mission: Impossible 7 to broadcasters churning out soap episodes — the pandemic has meant a root-and-branch rethink of how filming is done, actors dress and interact, and all those extra costs can be funded.
James Burstall, chief executive of Argonon, a London-based group of seven independent production companies, describes the lockdown as requiring “the most horrific open heart surgery on ourselves”. The resumption, meanwhile, poses its own peculiar challenges: once-routine crowd scenes and moments of intimacy, let alone complex stunts or fight scenes, all look like a daunting new frontier of risk. The creative integrity of projects conceived in less trying times is on the line.
This sector should, perhaps, be well placed to take the restrictions in its stride. Directors make their names by defying the constraints of physics and everyday life to turn out spectacular, otherworldly visions on screen. Even before the pandemic, Luegenbiehl described production as “a crazy wild beast” that never comes to heel but somehow produces magic.
Netflix’s special privilege is facing this production crunch with what appears to be a humming business model. The tech group epitomises the streaming revolution and has emerged as one of the winners of the lockdown economy. While rivals such as Disney bleed from cinema shutdowns and television broadcasters nurse wounds from the advertising slump, Netflix’s share price is up by a quarter since January. It doubled its subscriber growth targets in the first quarter and, before the year is out, it is expected to pass the 200 million subscriber mark. 
Wearing PPE all the time doesn’t quite work unless you are filming a medical drama
Housebound customers have lapped up shows such as Tiger King, a docuseries that drew 64 million viewers and turned a gay, gun-wielding, mulleted zookeeper in Oklahoma into a celebrity on five continents. Shows such as La casa de papel have also been on a tear, seemingly regardless of language. Some 65 million households watched the fourth series when it launched in April, and the iconic red jumpsuits began to appear as far afield as Puerto Rican rap videos and Greek football terraces. “All of a sudden, borders [of culture] were erased, but then also this decades-long Hollywood dominance in English‑language content,” says Diego Ávalos, the Netflix executive overseeing Iberia. “They were no longer the only player in town.”
But to keep drawing international subscribers (more than half its paying customers and most of its subscriber growth is outside the US), Netflix has to maintain a steady flow of catchy original fare for markets as different as Saudi Arabia, Denmark and Brazil. This year, it increased its budget for original content by 50 per cent. With almost 300 shows commissioned and in various stages of production, according to Ampere Analysis, its pipeline is double that of rival services such as Disney+ or Amazon Prime (backed by a $17bn content budget in 2020). 
But like a shark swimming, it must keep moving to survive. And it has to do it with shows made all over the world. That’s a huge challenge, even before the intervention of a deadly global pandemic. “At first it will be strange — we have no choice but to adapt,” says Cristina López Ferraz of Vancouver Media, the producers of La casa de papel. “The show must go on.”
It was a weekend in March when most of Netflix’s original productions in Europe went dark. Luegenbiehl recalls trying to escape for an hour, only to be interrupted mid-workout by her French team; decisions could not wait. “It’s 9pm on a Saturday night at the gym and I’m there deciding what to do with our French production slate,” she sighs, speaking from a whitewashed room in her Amsterdam home. The stop order soon went out to shows such as The Witcher, a fantasy drama filming at the UK’s Arborfield Studios. By Monday, one of its cast — the bristled Game of Thrones veteran Kristofer Hivju — had tested positive on his return home to Norway.
Luegenbiehl compares the following weeks to an “around the world in 80 days” experience for her team as they looked at different countries’ ways of handling film-making in a pandemic. Just as there is no single template of demands for filming a documentary, romantic comedy or stunt-packed action film, every country was developing its own rule book for life under Covid bit-by-bit. “There wasn’t any consistency out there and there wasn’t really a road map,” she says. 
There wasn’t any consistency out there and there wasn’t really a road map
They did have some luck though. Remote and small, Iceland became a rare haven for production in April and a test bed for safe techniques. While filming the apocalyptic Netflix series Katla, director Baltasar Kormákur developed a colour-coded system of arm bands and zones — since studied by his peers around the world — to bring keep-your-distance order to a bustling set. But just as important as Kormákur’s ingenuity was a quirk of fate: his production office was next to a medical company. Every cast and crew member could be tested before shooting and retested where necessary. 
Before their sets fell silent, some valuable Netflix shows such as The Crown managed to shoot just enough material to go into post-production with only a few compromises on scenes. And since the lockdown hit, some in the industry have found workarounds. Documentary makers filmed from doorsteps, or distributed cameras to homes. Burstall describes how Argonon’s House Hunters International spin-off filmed drone sequences “with a director in New York and a crew in Melbourne in Australia”. The BBC also shot a remake of Alan Bennett’s classic Talking Heads in April, but needless to say there are limits to the market for monologue drama.
My hope is that you would never be able to notice any of the changes that we make
Movies and high-end scripted shows, the stuff of Netflix and other big Hollywood studios, pose a challenge of a different order. The more expensive the cast, the more crowded the scenes, the more jet-setting the international shoots planned, the bigger the headache facing producers. The countermeasures can range from the mundane (round-the-clock cleaning, temperature tests, more Winnebagos for cast members to have plastic-wrapped, solitary lunches) to the seemingly ridiculous (expensive virus-killer robots firing out UV rays). Luegenbiehl says Netflix is considering hiring entire hotels “for extended periods” so everyone “can be in one place and one location”. 
“The way we are looking at this is that we should start small and build up,” says Ben Holt, Netflix’s UK director of physical production. “I know the soaps are going back and they are socially distancing but that doesn’t work with high-end series. Looking at big crowd scenes, big stunt scenes, all of these require very methodical thought and planning.” 
Recommended
Door-stopper filming protocols have been developed by various trade bodies around the world. Britain’s version recommends avoiding crowd scenes where extras are “face to face”. Cast members, meanwhile, are encouraged where possible to do their own hair and make-up. In practice, regular testing may be essential for the main cast. “Wearing PPE all the time doesn’t quite work unless you are filming a medical drama,” Holt says, with a deadpan delivery. 
Estimated Covid precautions will add 10 to 30 per cent to budget costs, say two producers. But in practice, by far the biggest obstacle is insurance. Few independent film-makers can afford the risk of another shutdown, or a lead actor falling ill. Yet finding cover is all but impossible. John McVay of Pact, the UK trade body for independent producers, says Netflix is so “hungry for content” it can afford to absorb the risk. “If you are a small drama producer in Glasgow or Cardiff, you cannot insure yourself, no way,” he says.
Netflix has lent a helping hand, establishing a $150m hardship fund for creative industries, while also hoovering up some movies robbed of their cinema outlet. It represents not just the balance of financial power in show business, but potentially of creative risk too. “For a long time, cinema was the risk-taker and television was much more by the numbers,” says James Swarbrick, chief executive of Hindsight Media, which has financed independent movies such as The King’s Speech. “Now there are some really edgy creative things on television, while cinema, because it has to, has become a little bit generic. There is a danger that that trend really accelerates.”
Jamie Campbell knows he is one of the fortunate ones. As the executive producer of Sex Education, a hit show following the fumbling teen travails of Otis (Asa Butterfield) and his sex therapist mother (Gillian Anderson), Campbell’s company Eleven Films is on an almost nonstop treadmill of Netflix work. Even as the second season of the cringeworthy yet uplifting drama was being filmed, creator Laurie Nunn’s team was busy writing series three. The question now: can filming start in September without compromises that dull the show’s feel-good spirit? 
It sounds stubborn but we haven’t changed the scripts. We don’t want to change the scripts
“It is a big production, it takes place over multiple locations, it has a lot of cast and crew, and famously it involves sex scenes,” says Campbell, as he pulls at the collar of his brown hoodie while speaking from the kitchen of his north London home. “When lockdown began, it was difficult to conceive conditions, or conditions similar to it, where we could shoot. And that is true for high-end drama in general.” 
The gamble they are taking is to plan for what might be, rather than what is. “There is a temptation in the industry to look at the world today and work out if you can shoot today and, of course, the answer is you can’t,” Campbell says. “We’re not drawing up a protocol that reflects today, but conditions in three or four months’ time, in order to make it credible that we will be shooting.” Testing needs to be readily available, in other words, as well as some relaxing of social-distancing rules.
Most of the show is filmed in Wales, along the Wye Valley and Vale of Usk, including in a spacious old university campus in Caerleon (which was converted into a Bafta-nominated set). More sets are likely to be built there to minimise brushes with the public at location shoots. Filming is also being scheduled with exteriors coming early — Welsh sunshine is as fleeting as it is glorious — and intimacy scenes moved further down the shoot, when more regular testing should be possible.
Above all, the aim is to leave the script untouched by Covid. “It sounds stubborn but we haven’t changed the scripts,” says Campbell. “We don’t want to change the scripts. We are trying to create a different energy and atmosphere in this show and, in some ways, we want to bring positivity and optimism that is hard to come by in the real world at the moment.” 
One of Campbell’s commissioners at Netflix is Anne Mensah, a popular veteran of UK television who oversaw Top Boy for the streamer and the award-winning Chernobyl series when she was at Sky. With a chuckle, she admits to “meddling with lots of people right now” as they try to adapt projects to address Covid risks. But she casts it as no more than behind-the-scenes tradecraft. 
“Our basic principle is that we only move forward when the creatives are happy. My hope is that you would never be able to notice any of the changes that we make,” she says. “At the point where there is a crowd replication scene, and you say, ‘Oooh, I can spot that person there, there and there’, we will definitely be failing.”
British soaps such as ITV’s Coronation Street have started working the pandemic into storylines; one undisclosed Netflix show in Europe is thinking of doing the same. Asked how she imagines Covid will appear in future scripts and dramas, Mensah pauses for thought: “I hope it will be subtle and not painted with a fat brush.” 
Even since lockdown, she has commissioned a few “fully, fully awesome things”, but none make a reference to Covid. She thinks it is just too soon for scripted drama to capture the moment. With a laugh and a swing of the arm she says: “We would almost certainly get it wrong.”

https://www.ft.com/content/87f1f7fe-af30-11ea-a4b6-31f1eedf762e,Griselda Murray Brown,What to watch on Netflix now: the best shows and documentaries,2020-06-16,04:04:09,"Five hours into a beautifully shot but otherwise pointless Netflix documentary series about babies, Griselda Murray Brown took to our culture podcast, Culture Call, with a warranted gripe: Netflix is not serving us the good stuff.
We are oversaturated with mediocrity at a critical time in history. So to get past the recommended titles, Gris and co-host Lilah Raptopoulos put out a call to listeners: what are the best things streaming now?
Below is a curation of responses. Our listeners have excellent taste.
Victoria Amico in London emailed us to recommend three documentaries on the subject of race in America:
Lilah highly recommends I Am Not Your Negro (Amazon Prime). Raoul Peck’s documentary creates a narrative out of notes and letters written by James Baldwin in the 1970s. It discusses the lives and deaths of his three close friends: civil rights leaders Malcolm X, Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr. It is extremely moving, and a crucial education to help understand the growing Black Lives Matter movement.
Martha O’Neil tweeted us to recommend four Netflix documentaries: Circus of Books, about a famous LGBT+ porn shop in LA; A Secret Love, about a former baseball player who kept her decades-long lesbian relationship a secret; Wild Wild Country, a docuseries about the Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his cult of followers, who built a utopian city in Oregon; and Three Identical Strangers, the true story of triplets who were separated at birth and found each other in their early adulthood (which Lilah also highly recommends).
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich (Netflix): “It’s horrific, but you absolutely should watch it if you can stomach it.” — Kerri McEvoy, London, via Instagram
The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Netflix) explores the mysterious death and possible murder of a black transgender activist who had a meaningful role in the Stonewall Riots and LGBT+ rights movement. On Pride Month, this film maintains Johnson’s legacy and role in history. It was highly recommended by listener (and colleague!) Hannah Sarney.
Our producer Lina Prestwood recommends Kingdom of Us (Netflix) which tells the story of a woman and her seven children after their father’s suicide. Lina calls it “a thoughtfully made documentary about grief, memory and family. It scooped up the Best Documentary prize at the 2017 London Film Festival for good reason!”
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories (Netflix) is a Japanese anthology series that listener Jon Bonesteel described on Twitter as “snippets of life around a dish at a diner in Tokyo. Sweet and fun.”
Better Things (BBC iPlayer, Hulu) is “by far my favourite find of the last 12 months. This sitcom is created, directed, written and starred in by Pamela Adlon. Like Normal People, it manages to tap into an enormous wealth of emotional nostalgia for me. I grew up in a household where it was just girls, and that love-and-fierce-hate relationship between girls in puberty with your mum is evoked so beautifully and acted so insightfully here. Not to mention the fact that it is bloody funny. Half-hour segments that you can escape into.” — Jennifer Macdonald, South London, via audio note
Upload (Amazon Prime) is “sublime. There are 10 episodes in total and it’s created by Greg Daniels, who made Parks and Recreation. It’s a beautiful love story that explores the afterlife, love and technology. Highly recommend if you like sci-fi.” — Amirah Valu, London, via email
Schitt’s Creek (Netflix), “because the family lost everything but come through it better . . . and I hope we as individuals and as a country will come through this better!” — Renee Burns, Boston, via email
Call My Agent!, or Dix pour cent in French (Netflix), is “based on a talent agency in Paris. It’s very watchable, very witty and the episodes are half an hour. I’ve found watching something with subtitles quite soothing at the moment, because you have to actually watch it to tell what’s going on. You can’t be on your phone. (Full disclosure, I am Griselda’s cousin!)” — Chloë Webster, London, via audio note
Giri/Haji (Netflix, BBC iPlayer) explores the effect of a murder in Tokyo and London. Listener Anna Simons calls it “original, witty, lyrical, dramatic, culturally sensitive. Great to see two handsome, sexy Japanese male leads (first time perhaps in a western production).” 
The Korean series Stranger (Netflix) is “a crime thriller equal to the best Scandi / European series out there. It’s highly rated in Asia, but, even among Korean drama fans, seems to have been overlooked in Europe.” — Rebecca Hallam, Copenhagen, via email
The Honourable Woman (BBC iPlayer, HBO Max) is “with Maggie Gyllenhaal, about the Israel-Palestine conflict. I’ve just finished it and am still amazed by how well it was done. It gets harder and harder to watch. The cinematography is amazing.” — Carolin Meyer, London, via audio note
This piece has been amended since publication to clarify that the 1992 LA riots were sparked by the police beating of Rodney King

https://www.ft.com/content/9f1403f8-9f38-11ea-b65d-489c67b0d85d,Suzi Feay,Space Force — Steve Carell lands as a lunatic general in cosmic Netflix comedy,2020-05-26,11:53:27,"It’s a grim thought, but imagine for a moment what Donald Trump’s favourite four-star general might look like. Unshakeably loyal, fervently patriotic, dangerously impetuous, contemptuous of experts, a little bit dim, lightly shaded with prejudice. Now imagine all that played for laughs, and if what you’ve come up with could only be encompassed by Steve Carell, congratulations, you’ve dreamt up Space Force. 
In the new Netflix series, the president has impulsively tweeted “Boots on the Moon!” and so a vast military Shangri-La costing billions of dollars is magicked into being in the Colorado Desert. Leading the enterprise is the newly elevated General Mark Naird, much to the fury of rival Kick Grabaston (Noah Emmerich), who’s probably brighter than him, a lot meaner, and definitely more sexist. The heads of all the services — Army, Air Force, Navy (a crisply caparisoned Jane Lynch), Marine Corps and Coast Guard, perpetually the underdog — convene to discuss the issue. Naird’s vast new scope and vaster budget cause ructions. “This is bullshit! Space is part of the air!” 
Though Naird takes to it (“I can be flexible if I’m ordered to be”), his family is unhappy with the move to the desert. The next time we see wife Maggie (Lisa Kudrow), her circumstances have drastically and inexplicably changed. I hope the writers just leave leave that particular plot development unexplained — that would be hilarious. John Malkovich as head scientist Dr Adrian Mallory merits a huge fee for his first line alone: “We need to cancel the launch.” A top-secret rocket launch (although even the guy at the gas station knows about it) is scheduled, with a trio of members of congress in attendance, but the weather is unpropitious. Naird is unmoved. Scientists? Pah! Whadda they know?
For decades now Malkovich has been locked in a battle with Christopher Walken to determine who can enunciate in the most mannered fashion, and here it gets to the point where you might be thinking, “Uh-oh, Malko has forgotten his lines. But as the bucket of fact-based icy water to Naird’s flaming lunacy, he’s perfect. Naird is especially suspicious of Mallory’s sidekick, Dr Chan (Jimmy O Yang), wanting to know where he’s from . . . originally. 
But the point about Naird is that although he’s a dunce, he’s a sweet one. Even so, there are queasy moments. A young Hispanic congresswoman not a little reminiscent of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asks why so much money is being spent on the project when she has constituents on food stamps. The high-minded reply in favour of military spending leaves an odd taste in the mouth. 
That aside, there’s plenty to enjoy in Space Force. It works a little harder for its jibes than its underpowered space comedy rival Avenue 5, and its essential set up — the mayhem that ensues when mankind imposes puny attempts at order on chaos — is the biggest joke of all. Cosmic, in fact.

https://www.ft.com/content/284fa811-e90b-4f08-9bf3-909504b47611,Tom Braithwaite,Netflix is chilling in Iceland but the rest of the world is a problem,2020-05-08,10:00:46,"Although he later dismissed it as a “playful misfire”, Bruce Springsteen’s 1992 single “57 Channels (And Nothin’ On)” is a decent pop song and a good summary of the current threat to television.
Blessed with the biggest captive audience in history, media companies are struggling to take full advantage. Most vulnerable are advertising-supported broadcasters such as the UK’s ITV, which saw ad revenues plunge 42 per cent in April, or those reliant on live sport.
Even subscription-driven businesses widely seen as benefiting from lockdowns are under strain. Netflix attracted 15.8m additional customers in the first quarter. It needs to give them something to watch.
The crunch is not immediate — Netflix is in post-production on a series of hits such as the next series of The Crown — and the company says it can stick to its planned releases into next year.
But eventually the streaming service will run out of the “original content” that it has bet on in the past few years. A $17bn annual budget is of limited use when your stars are stuck at home and your crews must socially distance.
It is a reason to be cautious on Netflix, whose shares have risen 30 per cent this year and whose $200bn valuation is more than nine times its revenues and 90 times profits.
Yet in two corners of the world, at least — South Korea and Iceland — it has continued filming.
Having already hosted productions of Game of Thrones, Justice League, Star Wars and Black Mirror in recent years, Iceland is now receiving a new flurry of calls from producers considering it as a location.
“Where I live in New York, the streets around me would have been lined with film crews for the pilot season,” said Hlynur Gudjonsson, Icelandic trade commissioner. “There is probably a certain amount of desperation brewing.”
Iceland’s film commission is lobbying for the two-week quarantine for visitors to be relaxed for incoming actors and crew, suggesting they can take Covid-19 tests before arriving and stay apart from the local population while they shoot.
Recommended
And Netflix is pressing ahead filming Katla, a sci-fi series that starts with the eruption of a subglacial volcano.
In an op-ed this week, the company’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos pointed to a strict regime on the Icelandic set — temperature checks and steam-cleaned wardrobes — as a sign of how production might be opened up elsewhere. Notably, the article appeared in the Los Angeles Times and praised California governor Gavin Newsom.
However, it is hard to imagine Hollywood returning to normal soon. Far more important than any specific safety precautions in production are national policies. Iceland has tested more than a 10th of its population for the virus. The US and other laggards such as the UK are way behind.
That does not mean Netflix is moving to Iceland en masse. It is not big enough to take on a significant amount of the world’s stalled production. And for all its otherworldly beauty, low-rise Reykjavik cannot fill in for city skyscrapers; Arctic beaches cannot pass for Malibu.
To resume full-scale production, Netflix and its rivals are left praying for lockdowns to lift in other parts of the world. Otherwise, we will be left in the situation The Boss described: “We switched ’round and ’round ’til half past dawn; there was 57 channels and nothin’ on.”

https://www.ft.com/content/439f5379-5a84-4c11-b2b0-0846177a0264,Anna Nicolaou,Netflix lays out plans to reopen production on shows and films,2020-05-05,15:01:49,"Netflix has laid out plans to reopen production on its shows and films, outlining a new normal for Hollywood sets that involves daily temperature checks, boxed lunches instead of buffet-style tables and disposable applicators for make-up. 
The streaming company, which produces local language movies and television series across the globe, has already begun shooting again in South Korea, Japan and Iceland, said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer. It plans to resume production in Sweden this month, and Norway in July. 
TV and movie sets closed across the US from March, delaying the production of hits such as Stranger Things and Succession, and affecting companies from industry giants like Disney to small independent film studios. Thousands of employees have been laid off or furloughed. 
“Because Netflix shows and films are made around the globe, we’re starting to learn how to get production going again despite the crisis,” Mr Sarandos wrote in the Los Angeles Times. “There are thousands [of] crew members anxious to return to work, and millions of people relying on the entertainment they produce.”
Mr Sarandos offered an insight into the new ways of doing things that will probably become the norm for Hollywood sets. In South Korea, for example, where Netflix has been shooting romance series “Love Alarm”, all cast and crew employees have their temperatures checked daily. If anyone shows signs of infection, production is halted. 
The show must — and will — go on
Hand sanitiser, masks and gloves have become fixtures of Netflix sets in these countries. Actors eat boxed lunches, rather than helping themselves from buffet-style food tables and communal snacks. Every few hours, the cast and crew take a break to wash their hands and disinfect surfaces. Make-up artists use single-use, disposable applicators and wardrobes are steam-cleaned daily. 
Mr Sarandos warned that scenes that involve crowds or “intimate moments” would need to be postponed until the crisis eases. Scripts may need to be rewritten, or producers would have to use technology to recreate a scene that otherwise would have been filmed live, he added. 
“The show must — and will — go on,” Mr Sarandos concluded. 
As Hollywood passes its eighth week of the shutdown, executives have begun wondering about when cameras can roll again. In the US, states such as Georgia have already begun reopening, while California governor Gavin Newsom announced that some businesses would open their doors again this week. Tyler Perry, the producer and actor, is planning to reopen his Atlanta sets next month.
But there are still considerable question marks about reopening sets, warned Rich Greenfield, partner at consultancy LightShed Partners. 
“If you are an aspiring actor or part of the film crew, getting back to work may be a financial necessity,” he said. “But if you are one of the world’s biggest movie or TV stars, do you want to take the risk?”

Hunter Martin, an analyst at CreditSights, said that a promotion for the company to investment-grade — or triple B and above — was possible “over a multiyear horizon"".
Europe’s high-yield bond market has seen very few new deals since lockdowns to contain coronavirus took hold across the continent. That marks a contrast to the US, which has seen a rush of racier deals in recent weeks from companies heavily affected by the outbreak.

UBS analysts warned this month of risks to the €1.14tn of triple B rated debt in Europe — a sum that has ballooned from just €330bn in 2011. During the same period the growth in double B rated bonds has been much more moderate, rising from €74bn to €185bn.
UBS predicts as much as €110bn of fallen-angel debt resulting from coronavirus stress, and says fears of selling pressure from rating-sensitive investors could exacerbate a sell-off in corporate bond markets.

Because of the lockdown, that began in mid-March, Wall Street expectations had been high. During the quarter, Netflix debuted new shows such as Tiger King, a docuseries which became a bingeing sensation, drawing 64m viewers, the company said on Tuesday.
During January and February user growth was as projected, but the March lockdown produced a surge in new customers. Most of these subscribers came from outside the US, where much of the country only went into isolation towards the end of the month.
During the quarter, Netflix signed up almost 7m subscribers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, followed by 3.6m in Asia. The overseas totals weighed on revenues, since most of the new customers paid in currencies that weakened against the US dollar.

Netflix has this year faced an influx of competition in the video streaming market it pioneered as Disney, Apple and Comcast unveiled their own services. 
The challenge for Netflix and its peers is to keep people satiated with programming, even as new productions shut down. Netflix on Tuesday said its second-quarter programming slate should not be hit, apart from issues with dubbing in other languages, with Italian voice actors sheltered at home for weeks. 
The company anticipates its growth to return to normal by the end of June, forecasting it would add 7.5m subscribers in the second quarter. But Netflix warned: “Given the uncertainty on home confinement timing, this is mostly guesswork.”

That same morning, Netflix added seven new programmes to its platform — among them a docuseries about the lurid life of a zoo operator named Joe Exotic. In the next 10 days, Tiger King went on to become a smash hit, with more than 34m Americans tuning in, according to Nielsen.

		 slowing US subscriber growth and lavish spending on content. 
Meanwhile, Disney soared, as chief executive Bob Iger pushed into Netflix’s territory with the launch of its own streaming service, called Disney+. Over the course of 2019, Disney’s stock price increased 35 per cent while Netflix shares gained 20 per cent, underperforming the broader stock market. 
Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, and this dynamic — like many others across the business world — has been flipped upside down. Three out of Disney’s four businesses are in peril, as theme parks and cinemas are shut and a slump in advertising hurts television. But Netflix, which does not run adverts, is benefiting from a surge in online streaming. 
Netflix has become one of the rare businesses that are not only surviving, but thriving, in the stay-at-home era. The group’s shares reached record highs this week as its market capitalisation jumped to $192bn, above that of corporate giants such as ExxonMobil and Cisco and neck-and-neck with Disney.
The same pattern is playing out in bond markets. Netflix’s bonds are junk-rated, while Disney enjoys an A

		 But in the crisis, Disney’s borrowing costs have risen while Netflix’s have fallen. 
A 10.5 year Netflix bond now yields 3.6 per cent, down from a peak of almost 5 per cent last October. Remarkably, this is in the same range as the 10-year bond Disney clinched last month with a coupon of 3.8 per cent, despite the two companies’ wide disparity in credit rating. 
“I would rather be in Netflix [bonds] all day long at 4 per cent or sub-4 per cent,” than in traditional media, said Jack Parker, senior fixed income associate at asset manager Diamond Hill. “One of the backstops of this bond is the equity. The market cap on top of you is astronomical. And if you believe the debt is the first in the capital structure, which it is, it gives you a massive margin of safety.”
Mr Parker said he believes “the stay at home demand is crazy . . . particularly for Netflix, which is the most popular thing in pop culture”.
Bernstein analysts also argued the credit agencies “have got it backwards”, noting that they rate Netflix bonds at BB-, or “junk” level, while the struggling media group ViacomCBS is rated at BBB, giving it investment-grade status. 
But public markets are signalling ViacomCBS debt is riskier than Netflix. Recently issued ViacomCBS 10.5 year notes were priced at a 5.1 per cent yield, above the 4.5 per cent that Netflix’s equivalent bonds are trading. 
Netflix sceptics have always pointed to the frothy-seeming multiple of its shares and high debt load, neither of which have gone away. Despite trading about the same market value, Netflix made $20bn in annual revenue last year compared with Disney’s $70bn. A valuation of nine times sales is well above even other internet stocks. Amazon, for instance trades at four times its $280bn revenues. 
While Nielsen and other data providers have released figures depicting a skyrocketing in streaming during quarantine, Netflix is not immune to the economic destruction. As part of the lockdown, Hollywood lots went dark in March, delaying production of Netflix shows such as Stranger Things and The Witcher.
In a prolonged shutdown, Netflix could run out of new programming, a problem the company has not previously had to cope with. Viewers might cancel their subscription and try another service. There is no shortage of alternatives, with two more streaming services, Comcast’s Peacock and Quibi, launched this month and another new rival — HBO Max — arriving next month. 
So far, Netflix has shown no signs of slowing its voracious release schedule. This week alone the company added 13 new shows and films, with another dozen scheduled for the rest of the month. 
Netflix may also be able to snap up other content on the cheap. Many Hollywood directors have previously clung to releasing their movies in theatres over streaming; but now, with cinemas shut indefinitely and theatre owners headed for bankruptcy, studios are scrambling to sell their movies to Netflix.
The streaming company has seen an influx of pitches from movie studios in recent weeks, said people familiar with the matter, as producers look to at least make some return on their investment. 
On Tuesday, Netflix is expected to report it added 7.4m new subscribers in the three months ending in March. The company is also likely to reveal more details about its content pipeline during an analyst call with senior management. While Reed Hastings and other Netflix top brass typically pre-tape a video Q&A from the company’s offices, this time around they will dial in from home through Google Hangouts. 
Netflix typically taps the high-yield bond markets to fill its coffers in April and October, after first quarter and third-quarter earnings. To keep up that cadence, it is due for an issuance this month. 
Netflix ended 2019 with about $5bn on its balance sheet, and also holds a $750m credit line, which it has not drawn. Analysts expect that these backstops could get Netflix through the next six months to a year, if needed. Despite its cash pile, “Netflix may want to take advantage of [favourable yields] and access the market now”, said Neil Begley, senior analyst at Moody’s. “Who knows what’s around the corner?”

https://www.ft.com/content/b3690d9e-77f6-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377,John Bleasdale,Netflix prison horror The Platform rings uncannily true today,2020-04-07,04:00:27,"When I met Spanish film-maker Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia at the Macau International Film Festival in December, the world was a different place. An hour’s ferry ride across the water, a crackdown on mass demonstrations in Hong Kong was under way, and the UK and Europe were still convulsed with conflict over Brexit. However, neither of us could have guessed how the nightmare vision of his debut feature The Platform would take on such pointed relevance when it hit Netflix during the coronavirus outbreak.
In the film, a young man Goreng (Iván Massagué) awakes to find himself on the 47th level of a vertical prison. Each cell has a hole in the floor and every day a food platform is lowered. The inmate on each successive level eats what they can before the table moves on, so the higher levels gorge themselves before the lower levels scrabble for leftovers. At first Goreng is incredulous and hopes for civility, but as each month he finds himself positioned at a different random level, barbarity and even cannibalism soon become the norm.
The intended political message is all too clear, as the director confirms. “The biggest problem we have today is the sharing of wealth,” Gaztelu-Urrutia says. “It’s a problem we’ve had for 500 years. And it is a problem we will have 500 years in the future. It is not a film against one political or economic system, but more about the behaviour of individuals within that world. The movie is not out to change the world, but to change how you behave as an individual. If you were in this world, how would you behave? What would you do on level 6? Or what would you do if you were on level 200?”
This great “what if” of the film feels far less abstract today than when we met. I am in northern Italy, having lived in lockdown for weeks while Gaztelu-Urrutia in Spain is likewise secluded. On the news, we see different reactions to the crisis: from the panic buying of provisions to singing from the balconies, and The Platform’s portrayal of confinement feels very close to home.
The food in the film begins as a sumptuous feast, worthy of a Flemish still life or a MasterChef final. “We wanted to make an idealisation of the food,” the director says. “We wanted to show decadent opulence. It is completely different from the rest of the prison, which is grey and geometric and not very human. The food is the opposite. The food is the only thing that has colour in the movie.”
That, and the blood that begins to flow. But although the film has gruesome similarities with high-concept horror films such as Saw and The Cube, Gaztelu-Urrutia looked closer to home for his chief inspiration, The Exterminating Angel. In Buñuel’s 1962 surrealist masterpiece, a dinner party becomes an endless ordeal when the guests discover they are unable to leave. The sense of isolation and social distance is all too potent in both films. It also sets up a test of values that resembles the ethical issues surrounding panic-buying. Goreng works out that if everyone takes only their fair share, there will be enough food to reach the lowest levels. His mission to enforce his scheme comes to resemble a gory Quixotic crusade. 
Yet for all its brutality the film ends on a note that is not entirely bleak. “You go down, down, down and there’s no hope, so we had to show some hope at the end,” Gaztelu-Urrutia tells me. “But the most important thing is not to change the world but to change yourself. That is the real victory of the movie.” It is a lesson that we are now learning in reality.‘The Platform’ is available on Netflix now

https://www.ft.com/content/0128e30a-7348-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca,Anna Nicolaou,Netflix or Amazon? Fashion TV goes head to head,2020-04-02,04:00:29,"Christian Siriano, the American designer whose career was launched by reality show Project Runway, and who now serves as the show’s on-screen mentor, is currently sewing surgical face masks in bulk for the governor of New York.
This sentence would have been unthinkable just a few weeks ago. But as Covid-19 has swept the world, the unthinkable has become a daily reality.
While Siriano has diverted his attention from red carpet gowns to masks, fans of the show that kick-started his career will find themselves with plenty of television to while away their hours at home. Project Runway, the 15-year-old, mass-market show in which fashion moguls such as Michael Kors and Zac Posen judge the work of aspiring designers through a series of contests, has now spawned two streaming service copycats — including a new series on Amazon that Entertainment Weekly described as “first rate quarantine TV”.
Even as Hollywood productions have halted, streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+ have enough feel-good content to dole out for months. The amount of time people spend streaming surged 20 per cent globally from March 9-23, with daytime watching up nearly 40 per cent, according to analytics company Conviva.
Among our quarantined television options is the 18th season of Project Runway, this time anchored by supermodel Karlie Kloss; Next in Fashion, a Netflix reimagining of it starring Queer Eye’s Tan France and model Alexa Chung; and finally Amazon’s version, Making the Cut, which is led by former Project Runway stars Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn.
I asked the original creator of Project Runway why fashion is having a television moment now, nearly two decades after his idea debuted on US cable channel Bravo and became a cult favourite.
Eli Holzman recalls that demand for his initial concept — a reality show in which aspiring fashion designers compete — was not met with enthusiasm.
“When we were booking Project Runway initially, most designers turned us down. Reality TV was a bad word and they didn’t want to be associated with it,” says Holzman.
But now, as we are at the all-time peak of television production, that dynamic has changed. Project Runway is a “proven franchise” Holzman points out, making it a safer bet for streaming companies as they splash out billions of dollars on programming in a frenetic industry-wide battle for subscribers.
The new generation of fashion TV is looking to revive an ailing format as Project Runway’s ratings have deteriorated. This season’s March finale drew 1.4m viewers, ranking it the 12th most watched US cable telecast that day — trailing Fox News’ Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson.
Project Runway has a mostly refreshed cast. But even the newcomers are beholden to a surprisingly rigid format. Kloss studiously recites the same script that her predecessor Klum did 16 years ago. “In fashion, you are in, or you are out,” she pronounces in the first minutes of every episode.
The repetition can be stale. But at a time like this, the familiarity is also oddly comforting, like curling up in a worn blanket with a time capsule to the 2000s.
In contrast, Netflix’s Next in Fashion might be a bit too modern. From the first few minutes of episode one, there is a premium placed on anything to do with fame or social media.
Netflix’s competition is more cheerful than Project Runway, which is often laced with dramatic infighting and tearful breakdowns. Producer Yasmin Shackleton has said her goal was for the show to be “accessible and relatable”, and indeed, Next In Fashion is more like a TV version of the “positive vibes” posts that still proliferate across Instagram.
We speak to Ira Glass, host of the hit podcast ‘This American Life’, about reporting during Covid-19. How do you tell the stories of ordinary people without leaving home? What does American life look like today? Listen here
Designers are given professional seamstresses, and the contestants are more experienced than their Project Runway counterparts, with several having already worked on high-profile lines such as Stella McCartney and Jay-Z’s Rocawear. The designers often prove more capable than the hosts. In the most widely followed episode, a streetwear challenge, Chung came under fire for telling black designers that their work was “not her cup of tea”. Guest judge Kerby Jean-Raymond, of Pyer Moss, walks off set as France and Chung pushed for the elimination of Kiki Kitty and Farai Simoyi, two black women who have designed streetwear for decades.
Amazon’s Making the Cut, which debuted on March 27, strikes a more similar tone to Project Runway — albeit with a much bigger budget. When Project Runway, which Gunn and Klum hosted for 16 seasons, changed cable networks in 2018, the two stars decided to jump ship, choosing Amazon as their new home, where they were offered more freedom — and money.
Amazon’s deep pockets are evident in every aspect of the show. The prize pot of $1m is quadruple that of its rivals’. The very first episode features a lavish runway show for contestants, set against the Eiffel Tower in Paris’s night sky — a level of extravagance that Project Runway could not have managed.
Both Amazon and Netflix are trying to catapult these designers into real commercial success — a feat that Project Runway, apart from Siriano, has failed to achieve. As part of Netflix’s prize, the winner, designer Minju Kim, is selling her clothes on Net-a-Porter.
Amazon has taken this a step further. As with most things Jeff Bezos, Making the Cut goes beyond simply a TV show — it looks to envelop us further into the Amazon machine. Prime members can watch the show on Amazon.com, and then buy the winning pieces and have them shipped home for free.
But behind the glamour, all this begs the question: does it make sense for Amazon and Netflix to make these shows at all? There is almost definitely not enough demand to justify three near-identical series; such is the nature of the current streaming wars.
But it ultimately does not matter as much how many people watch these programmes; streaming companies are not beholden to the same business model of selling advertising based on ratings. Rather, they care about giving their subscribers fresh content.
Amazon and Netflix are trying to catapult these designers into real commercial success
In the current environment “everybody is just throwing stuff against the wall, hoping to see how it will work,” says Cyma Zarghami, the former head of Nickelodeon.
Netflix has barrelled into reality TV in recent months, with dating shows such as The Circle and Love is Blind. Fashion was another logical step, and unscripted TV is much cheaper to produce.
For Amazon, which makes most of its $280bn in annual revenues from online retail, the lavish push into reality TV may help buy its way into the proper fashion business. Luxury fashion has much higher margins than the plain socks and underwear that Amazon hawks through its online store.
We don’t know yet if either of these new shows will achieve what Project Runway has failed to do consistently: launch the next great fashion label. And we may never know how many people even watched these programmes, because streaming companies rarely reveal viewership data.
Nonetheless it helped me pass the time during a bizarre moment in history. The same can be said for millions of other people, who are being tethered even more to the companies serving bingeable programming.
For Amazon and Netflix, that is probably enough.

https://www.ft.com/content/70333747-f180-4887-8a26-27ab6b230299,Javier Espinoza,"YouTube, Amazon and Netflix cut picture quality in Europe",2020-03-20,15:00:28,"Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime, three of the world’s largest online video services, are taking the unprecedented step of reducing picture quality in Europe to ease pressure on broadband networks. 
The internet groups are responding to calls by the European Commission and some European telecoms companies to prevent internet congestion, as more people work and take classes at home during the coronavirus pandemic. 
YouTube is the world’s most popular video site with more than 2bn users tuning in every month, while Netflix had more than 160m viewers worldwide at the end of last year, including tens of millions across Europe. 
“We are making a commitment to temporarily default all traffic in the EU to standard definition,” YouTube said on Friday. It later added that traffic in the UK would also be curtailed, pointing to “ongoing conversations” with regulators including Ofcom. 
Hours earlier, Netflix said that “given the extraordinary challenges raised by the coronavirus”, it would temporarily throttle its data throughput too, meaning that some viewers would see a degradation in picture quality, in the hopes of reducing its traffic by a quarter.
Amazon on Friday added that it had “already begun the effort to reduce streaming bitrates whilst maintaining a quality streaming experience for our customers” in Europe. 
The unprecedented demand for streaming services to curtail their bandwidth usage is a sign of how concerned the authorities are that broadband networks will quickly become overloaded, as millions of office workers and school children turn to live video streaming at home. 
Last week, Telecom Italia reported a 70 per cent surge in internet traffic over its landline network as Italy went into lockdown, saying a “big contribution” came from online games such as Fortnite. Spanish telecoms operators have warned of a “traffic explosion”. However, in the UK, BT has insisted that its network will be able to cope with the increased demand. 
Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said this week that WhatsApp was seeing a sustained surge in usage that went “well beyond” seasonal peaks such as New Year’s Day. 
European Commissioner Thierry Breton met this week with Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, Alphabets chief Sundar Pichai and Susan Wojcicki, who runs Google-owned YouTube. 
Mr Breton welcomed their responses. “Millions of Europeans are adapting to social distancing measures thanks to digital platforms, helping them to telework, e-learn and entertain themselves,” he said. 
“People are coming to YouTube to find authoritative news, learning content and make connections during these uncertain times. While we have seen only a few usage peaks, we have measures in place to automatically adjust our system to use less network capacity,” YouTube said. “We will continue our work to minimise stress on the system, while also delivering a good user experience.”
Defaulting to standard definition, rather than the high definition that most viewers with good internet connections have become used to in recent years, could cut the data required to watch a video by more than half. However, YouTube viewers can still opt for HD quality. 
“Netflix has decided to begin reducing bit rates across all our streams in Europe for 30 days,” the company said. “We estimate that this will reduce Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25 per cent while also ensuring a good quality service for our members.”
Amazon said: “We support the need for careful management of telecom services to ensure they can handle the increased internet demand with so many people now at home full-time due to COVID-19. Prime Video is working with local authorities and Internet Service Providers where needed to help mitigate any network congestion.”

https://www.ft.com/content/805e158e-4cd6-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5,Leo Lewis,Korea rides Netflix wave to win at the Oscars,2020-02-12,05:00:43,"A pioneering director. A deserved Best Picture award at an Oscars night. Sublime storytelling via subtitles. This has happened only twice. 
This week, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, a South Korean masterpiece, became the first foreign language film to earn the industry’s top prize. And William Wellman’s 1927 aviation epic Wings, the last of the great silent movies, won the first ever Oscars. 
These two films, separated by more than 90 years, both emerged at a time of convulsive change brought on by disruptive technology, shifts in consumer behaviour and a reassessment of how to value creative intellectual property.
The year Wings was released, new recording technology ushered in the talkies, changing Hollywood forever. Parasite is a bellwether of an arguably greater change, propelled by translation algorithms and an unsustainable war among rival TV streaming services. 
Each media earnings announcement from Hollywood and Silicon Valley highlights the ferocious competition among Disney+, Hulu, Alphabet’s YouTube TV and AT&T’s WarnerMedia; the investment needed to compete with Netflix (167m global subscribers) and Amazon Prime (150m subscribers) also becomes evident. Netflix alone expects to burn through $2.5bn this year.
For content producers worldwide, it has become at once more difficult to bet on a winning production and, theoretically, easier to put content in front of new audiences. Parasite’s triumph belongs indisputably to Mr Bong, but he shares some credit with the new power of the globalised sofa. 
Content has never been so kingly. That is why Totoro and Spirited Away creator Studio Ghibli has embraced HBO and Netflix and why Colombian production companies with 72-part telenovelas are reassessing their newly global potential. Thousands of content companies are scrambling to find a place. Asian groups could find themselves especially well positioned given their massive output and, in Japan’s case, under-exploited back catalogue.
In the analysis of Parasite’s success, much will be made of the forces harnessed under the Netflix umbrella. Justifiably so. The Californian media company, its role as a studio, its new habit of exposing people to unfamiliar television and the way it has normalised the “pull” model of content delivery are all critical. 
US and worldwide audiences can browse and consume Belgian detective drama, Spanish biopics, Chinese reality shows and German cyber-thrillers with increasing indifference to origin. Language has become a surmountable barrier; subtitles are irrelevant. This audience consumes everything — from commentary on Instagram food pics to WeChat updates on the Oscar ceremony — as a jostling assault of images and words. Script along the bottom of a screen is nothing.
Mr Bong — and South Korean films more broadly — clearly understood this and directly benefited from Netflix’s expanding ambitions. In 2017, his Netflix-backed adventure Okja competed for the Palme d’Or at Cannes. The film industry-heavy audience booed when the Netflix logo appeared, but gave the film a four-minute standing ovation. 
Parasite is also part of a highly successful “Korean wave” of exports centred on music and drama and on the success of media giants CJ E&M and SM Entertainment. Even without Netflix, Korean soap operas have resonated famously well in China, Japan and much of south-east Asia. BTS, the world’s most lucrative touring band of 2019 with revenues of $196m and the current flag-bearers of Korean pop, has sold out Los Angeles’ Rose Bowl, London’s Twickenham and Barcelona’s Olympic stadium as part of a world tour that begins in April.
Recommended
Underlying this has been a double recognition by South Korean producers: their entertainment IP can be tweaked to have a distinct, rising value overseas and technology now allows them to pump it cheaply and accessibly to couch potatoes worldwide. 
It is too early to project how far this might go. The export revenues of South Korea’s “cultural contents” industry (including games, film, animation, drama and music) nearly reached $9bn in 2017 (the most recent government figures). That is almost the same as the global sales of Japan’s Nintendo in the financial year that ended in March 2019.
South Korea’s relatively small domestic market imbues its export efforts with greater vigour, says one agent who works closely with Asian music acts around the world. As Japan’s population shrinks, a similar shift of mindset may take hold across its games, music and animation industries.
That in turn could awaken a giant with even greater potential if the Netflix-Amazon-Disney streaming wars continue to spray around financial ordnance. Nintendo’s portfolio of characters is regarded as the most valuable that Disney does not already own. The Japanese group said this month that it was readying a Mario movie for the global market as it prepared to abandon its insistence on limiting its most valuable character to games.
Japan as a whole — along with everyone else — may need to get a bit more Korean if it wants to maximise profits from the globalised sofa.

Netflix posted some extraordinary numbers on Tuesday. Just not in the right area.
Apparently I was one of 76m people who watched the fantasy show The Witcher in the first four weeks of its release, which would make it the biggest debut for a Netflix TV series ever. I don't know how many people felt like me — that this was a pale imitation of Game of Thrones — and stopped streaming just as I did in the first half hour, but it may have been many millions as well. Netflix's new metrics count you as a viewer of a series even if you have only watched two minutes of a single episode.
Anyway, what was more concerning for investors was US subscriber numbers. Netflix added only 420,000 in the fourth quarter — below its guidance for 600,000 and well behind the 1.5m it added in the same period a year ago. It blamed price increases and competition from other streaming services.
The rivalry in its home market is intensifying all the time, with AppleTV+ and Disney+ launching and Peacock due in the summer. Analysts at Wedbush expect subscriber growth to “stall to a very slow crawl”, with only 1.5m added in the whole of 2020 in the US and Canada, compared to 23m additions internationally. 
If the US video streaming saga is getting more interesting, so too is the music one. Anna Nicolaou's scoop reveals Amazon Music has passed 55m users, nearly all of them paying subscribers. This makes it a serious contender in a market historically dominated by Spotify and Apple. Apple last summer said it had 60m subscribers to Apple Music, while Spotify remains the market leader with 113m paying subscribers. Analysts says Amazon has been appealing to a different segment of the market, opening up new, older households to streaming. 
1. Saudi Arabia implicated in Jeff Bezos phone hackFrom extraordinary numbers to extraordinary tales. After the Amazon boss and Washington Post owner exchanged mobile phone numbers at a dinner with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman's WhatsApp account was used to hack Jeff Bezos's handset. That's according to a forensic report seen by the FT, which says the hack allowed troves of data to be uploaded from the phone. Saudi Arabia says this is “absurd”. The journalist Jamal Khashoggi, murdered by Saudi operatives, was a columnist for the Washington Post, whose proprietor had commissioned an investigation into how the National Inquirer tabloid got details of his extramarital affair with former TV presenter Lauren Sanchez. The UN says this looks like “an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post’s reporting on Saudi Arabia”.
2. Vodafone hangs up on LibraThe mobile phone operator has becomethe eighth backer to abandon Libra, Facebook’s digital currency initiative, saying it would focus on its own mobile money payments service, M-Pesa as a means to extending financial inclusion. It said it would not rule out the possibility of future co-operation with Libra.
3. Deliveroo hanging on over fundingDeliveroo is facing a funding squeeze at the same time as its biggest British rival in online food apps, Just Eat, has been strengthened by its Takeaway.com merger. Tim Bradshaw reports investors are worried it may start to run low on capital later this year if it cannot close a funding deal with Amazon that has been held up by a competition investigation. Meanwhile, our Due Diligence newsletter asks whether Uber can find a solution to its endless cash burn.

4. Davos digital disputesThe US threatened to put “arbitrary” tariffs on UK car exports as the war of words between the two countries over digital services taxes heated up on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum's meeting. Rana Foroohar is there and reports that 2020 will be a year when the EU tries to bring the big US tech companies to heel.
5. The indisputably important world of digital twinsDigital twins — virtual copies of the real world that help with simulations — are one of the biggest trends in technology and the subject of John Thornhill's latest column. He cites examples such as UK retailer Marks and Spencer, which is increasingly using in-store sensors to create digital twins of its retail space. It can then use those data models to optimise its stores’ physical layout, monitor the temperature of its meat coolers and keep an eye on queues at its checkouts.
What fundraising chill? The thirst for unicorns remains strong.

Cruise, the self-driving unit of General Motors, unveiled its first autonomous electric vehicle on Tuesday, claiming it could be built “at roughly half the cost” of a conventional car. The minivan-like Origin was unveiled in San Francisco, reports Patrick McGee, and lacks pedals or a steering wheel and is designed for ride-pooling. The company has not set a timeline for commercial deployment or disclosed how many it plans to build. Cruise’s launch event focused on the design of the shuttle-like vehicle, including its significant interior space and the “superhuman sensing performance” that enables its sensors to see in the dark and through fog.

Netflix added 8.8m subscribers in the final three months of 2019, eclipsing its guidance for 7.6m and analyst forecasts for 7.9m. This was welcome news for the first quarter that the streaming group competed head-on with Disney and Apple, which launched rival services in November. 
However in the US, its largest market, Netflix added only 420,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter — below its guidance for 600,000 and well behind the 1.5m it added in the same period a year ago. 
Netflix blamed the US weakness on price increases last year and new competition from rival streaming launches. The company also warned that this softening in its home market would weigh on results for the current quarter. 
Netflix shares were little changed in after-hours trading. 
As the entertainment industry looks to streaming as the future of its business, the largest media companies are battling for market share in this new landscape. Traditional media groups Disney, Comcast’s NBCUniversal and AT&T’s WarnerMedia are all launching their own streaming services, bringing new competition to the market that Netflix pioneered. 
Investors are concerned about Netflix losing steam in America amid the sea of new streaming options. 
Blistering subscriber growth has been a crucial part of Netflix’s pitch to investors, who have driven up its share price in recent years. But sentiment cooled on the company last summer after it lost quarterly subscribers in the US for the first time since 2011.
Tuesday’s results did little to allay those fears. Netflix said it expects to add 7m new subscribers through the end of March this year; a slowdown from the 9.6m new subscribers in the first quarter of 2019 as more US customers cancel their subscriptions.
While analysts have fretted, Netflix executives have downplayed the impact of the “streaming wars”. 
In a letter to shareholders on Tuesday, the company said that Netflix has “a big head start in streaming”, while noting that despite the debut of Disney+ and Apple TV+, Netflix subscribers continue to watch more hours of programming. More than 76m subscribers watched the fantasy show The Witcher in the first four weeks of its release, Netflix claims, which would make it the biggest debut for a Netflix TV series ever. 
Netflix has looked to compensate for its US slowdown by emphasising faster growth elsewhere, such as Asia and Latin America. However profit margins are slimmer in these countries, where Netflix charges lower prices. 
On average, subscribers in the US and Canada bring Netflix $13.22 in revenue, while that number drops to $8.18 in Latin America and $9.07 in Asia-Pacific. 
“International subscription growth will not support Netflix valuations,” said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham. She predicts that Netflix will lose 4m US subscribers this year, as it faces competition from cheaper new streaming services. 
Netflix uses debt to help pay for its heavy spending on content as it races to build an enticing catalogue of TV shows and films. Long-term debt stood at $14.8bn at the end of December, up from $10.4bn at the end of 2018.

https://www.ft.com/content/b990d314-2030-11ea-92da-f0c92e957a96,Alex Barker,Netflix regional numbers reveal challenge of overseas streaming,2019-12-16,22:55:04,"Netflix has lifted the veil on its pace of expansion in different regions, revealing how rapid subscriber growth outside the US has partly been driven by lower revenues per user. 
To address investor concerns over its business losing steam in America, Netflix disclosed on Monday a fuller picture of operations in Europe, Latin America and Asia, which account for more than half its subscribers and most of its growth. 
The data underline both the promise and challenges facing Netflix as the first mover in relatively untapped international markets, where users are moving to streaming but are expecting to pay significantly lower subscription rates for the service than in the US. 
More than a quarter of the California-based company’s revenues were generated in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first three quarters of 2019, according to the numbers released on Monday. 
The subscriber base has grown by 25 per cent in the first three quarters of 2019 alone. But the average revenue raised for each of the 47.4m users stood at $10.26, compared with $12.36 in the US and Canada, where Netflix has been more aggressive in pricing. 
The differences are even more stark in Latin America, the company’s first international market outside the US. Subscriptions have almost doubled to 29.4m since the first quarter of 2017. But revenues per user stand at roughly $8.21, increasing by a modest 10 per cent since the first quarter of 2017 against a 25 per cent rise in the US over the same period. 
Netflix’s disclosure indicates that the gap with US revenues per user is partly reduced when foreign exchange movements are taken into account, particularly in Latin America. 
Asia is a smaller but faster-growing market for the subscription streaming service. The number of paying customers has increased 210 per cent since the first quarter of 2017, rising from 4.6m to 14.5m in the third quarter of 2019. 
Average revenue per user is $9.31, which is higher than Latin America but lower than in Europe and the US. Some analysts expect Netflix’s decision to launch a $3 mobile-only subscription in India to weigh on per-user income. 
The fast-paced growth in Netflix’s subscriber base has been a crucial part of its pitch to investors, who have driven up its share price in recent years. But sentiment began to cool on the company this summer after it lost US subscribers in the second quarter for the first time since 2011. Netflix shares are down about 15 per cent since July. 
Netflix said it would “only provide membership guidance for global paid memberships” in future quarterly reports, an approach aiming to both show its international ambitions and avoid an expectations game with Wall Street over US targets. 
Expansion outside the US will become ever more important for Netflix as it begins to feel the heat of competition from other streaming services, with Apple and Disney launching rival services in November. 
But Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, warned last week that Netflix might not be able to compensate for a slowdown in its biggest market with faster growth outside the US. She calculated $5.50 of monthly profit per US subscriber, 2.9 times higher than the $1.90 per subscriber in its international businesses. “International subscription growth will not support Netflix valuations,” she wrote in a note to clients. 
Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis argues that while free trial offers were the entrance point for most subscribers to Netflix, the streaming service is finding it harder to convert users into paying customers. 
This is proving true not just for the US, but in some international markets where Netflix is relatively more expensive because of the lower cost of living. In a paper released on Monday, Mr Harrington noted increasing free-trial abuse — where one person signs up to multiple offers with different email addresses — had prompted a rethink. Netflix has ended free trial offers across much of Latin America, and India early this year, and had since extended the policy to parts of Europe and Canada.

https://www.ft.com/content/a1dca806-1a8b-11ea-9186-7348c2f183af,Suzi Feay,Why Netflix’s The Witcher fails to steal the Game of Thrones crown,2019-12-13,05:00:45,"Considering he goes around killing monsters on request, the improbably chiselled and gruff Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) gets no thanks. Some of the ladies give this black-leather-clad hunk with the long silver hair the glad eye, but the more usual greeting is a curt “We don’t want your kind around here!” Even after he’s rid the village of a giant, pond-lurking spider. With its medieval stylings, sprawling narrative and liberal dusting of magic, Netflix’s The Witcher is presumably intended to fill the Game of Thrones-sized hole in viewers’ lives. Not forgetting the daft names. Fringilla. Stregobor. Jaskier. 
It’s certainly violent enough. Why stab someone in the back or punch them in the face once, when you could do it a dozen times? Street fights, where ne’er-do-wells obligingly assail our hero one by one, throb to the whop-whop and ktsss of blade slicing flesh. There’s also the sudden-death protocol. Any character who shows the slightest spark one minute is liable to get snuffed out the next. The Witcher himself has a basic ethical code: don’t hit women. Unless you really have to, that is. 
The plot gestures to the labyrinthine complexity of GoT with its triple narrative — fugitive princess, apprentice sorceress and our travelling beast-slayer. After a battle scene that is less about strategy and deployment than a thousand separate incidents of hand-to-hand combat, Ciri (Freya Allan) escapes the conflagration of her city with a loyal bodyguard. You feel for poor Anya Chalotra as misshapen Yennefer, having to go around with one shoulder hoisted up, a head permanently tilted and a wodge of cotton wool in her mouth. She will be beautiful one day, and it can’t come soon enough.
“Magic is organising chaos,” says her inscrutable instructress, which is no help at all when you’re told to move rocks with your mind. Sets and costumes (apart from Geralt’s) have a perfunctory air. The grubby-looking elves have sad little pointed ears and an aggrieved manner that suggests they can’t wait to get off the set. The horned, goat-eyed “Sylvan” is such a prosthetic fail it’s almost cute.
What on earth is going on? Jodhi May as the Queen delivers an indecipherable crib on current events before heading off to battle. Reticent Geralt attracts a tiresomely chatty follower, a lute-toting bard (Joey Batey). “There I go again, just delivering exposition,” he blabs, scratching desperately at the fourth wall. Characters in GoT were very sure of themselves. This lot look confused, and Cavill is like a rock in a stream, letting it all flow past him.

Users can choose speeds ranging from a stately 0.5x the normal rate to a positively dizzying 1.5x. Keela Robison, Netflix vice-president, said this was a feature that had been “frequently requested by our members”.
These people presumably included the proprietor of Efficiency in Everything, an American website that applies the principles of “industrial engineering” to all facets of domestic life. 
In 2016, the site published an article entitled, “Watch a three-hour movie in two hours + you get more time”. Saving four minutes a day on a given task, whether it’s doing the laundry or watching a film, will save you 1,200 hours over the course of a lifetime, the author Michael Kirk enthused. Just think of it: “More drama, more laughs, more drama, more suspense — same time.” What’s not to like?
Mr Kirk said he prefers to watch films and television programmes at 1.3x, but confessed to having watched “really long movies at 1.5x”. As if to reassure those who might balk at the thought of making the car chase in The French Connection, say, even more stomach-churning than it already is (think “Popeye” Doyle on speed), he suggested watching things at 1.1x. 
Even then, the gains are not negligible. Watching an hour-long episode of British Royal drama The Crown on Netflix at 1.1x, for example, would save you six minutes (as well as attenuating some of the series’ longueurs). Over the entire first season, you’d get back a whole hour — time you could use to shave off yet more minutes and hours of screen time, in a vicious or virtuous circle, depending on your point of view.
In 2016, when Mr Kirk wrote his piece, to do this on Netflix you had to download a special plug-in. One assumes the time spent doing that would have had to be subtracted from the time gained over the course of a season. Now, however, the Android feature delivers the ability to speed up or slow down with much less hassle. (There are currently no plans, Netflix says, to roll out the function to other devices.)
As Ms Robison acknowledged, not everyone regards this as a welcome innovation. There have, she admitted, been some “creator concerns”. That’s one way of describing the howls of anguish from aggrieved filmmakers that greeted the news. 
Brad Bird, director of Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol, denounced the new function as “another spectacularly bad idea”. And Judd Apatow tweeted: “No @Netflix no. Don’t make me have to call every director and show creator on Earth to fight you on this. Save me the time. I will win, but it will take a ton of time. Don’t f**k with our timing.”
This was a useful reminder that f**king with a film’s timing can do as much damage as doctoring its images. If fairly mainstream directors like Messrs Apatow and Bird felt moved to take up arms against Netflix, imagine how the Russian auteur Andrei Tarkovsky, regarded by many as the godfather of the so-called slow film movement, would have reacted. 
His 1979 film Stalker, loosely based on a Soviet-era science fiction novel, received a chilly response from the State Committee for Cinematography, which thought it dragged a bit. For Tarkovsky, this was a category error. “What a person normally goes to the cinema for is time,” he said. “Whether for time wasted, time lost, or time that is yet to be gained.”
The greatest directors, argues the American film-maker and screenwriter Paul Schrader, know how to wield the “scalpel of boredom”. It’s an insight Ms Robison and her colleagues at Netflix might care to reflect upon.

The California-based company added 6.8m subscribers in the three months ending in September, below its guidance for 7m.
Netflix shares rallied more than 8 per cent in after-hours trading despite the weaker-than-forecast results, suggesting that investors had feared a bigger miss. 
The pressure was on Netflix after it fell short of its guidance for subscribers in the previous quarter. The July misfire has depressed the stock more than 20 per cent over the past three months.
In the US, Netflix added 520,000 subscribers in the third quarter, below its forecast for 800,000, which the company blamed on a price increase earlier this year. But this was a recovery from the previous quarter, when the company lost subscribers in its biggest market for the first time since 2011. 
Outside the US, results were brighter: the company reported 6.3m new subscribers, above analyst forecasts for 6.05m. 
This was the last quarter before Netflix faces an influx of competition in the streaming market it pioneered, beginning with Apple and Disney in November. Netflix on Wednesday pared back projections for the year, citing factors including “new forthcoming competition”. The company now expects to add 26.7m subscribers in 2019, fewer than last year’s 28.6m.
Wednesday’s results “clearly illustrate a deceleration” in growth, said Patrice Cucinello, director at Fitch. 
Eric Haggstrom, an emarketer analyst, warned that “the fact that Netflix has shown disappointing growth without the new competition present is a negative omen for Netflix in 2020 and beyond”.
While analysts have fretted, Netflix’s top brass including chief Reed Hastings have largely brushed off the threat. In a letter to shareholders on Wednesday, the company said the new entrants presented a “modest headwind’ but that “we’ve been preparing for this new wave of competition for a long time”. 
Netflix’s guidance for the third quarter had been ambitious because the period included the return of Stranger Things, one of its marquee original television shows, which was thought to boost sign-ups. 
The company is expected to spend $15bn on content this year as it races to build out an enticing catalogue of shows and films. The cost of content has inflated as the streaming battle ratchets up. Netflix last month won a bidding war for the rights to Seinfeld starting in 2021, paying $500m over five years for the popular TV sitcom that originally aired from 1989 to 1998.
On an earnings call, Ted Sarandos, chief content officer, said that the most sought after shows now cost 30 per cent more than this time a year ago, while Reed Hastings, chief executive, quipped that the $100m Netflix spent on House of Cards seven years ago would now “be a bargain”. 
Netflix told shareholders on Wednesday that “amazing content can be expensive” and that “we don’t shy away from taking bold swings”. 
It has justified the splurge with fast subscriber growth, helping its stock soar in recent years. However, sentiment has soured after the second-quarter stumble. For the year Netflix stock has gained 7 per cent, compared to a 19 per cent rise for the

Netflix uses debt to help pay for its heavy content spending. Long-term debt stood at $12.4bn at the end of September, up from $10.4bn a year ago. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3.5bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that.
Revenues in the quarter jumped to $5.25bn, in line with expectations and up 31 per cent from a year ago. Net income climbed to $665m, from $403m a year ago.

Shares recorded their fourth consecutive day in the red, down 1.8 per cent Monday and hitting their lowest level in nearly nine months, after Barclays suggested Netflix’s base of subscribers would need to grow at least five- to eight-times its current level “in order to justify its present valuation”.
Barclays estimated Netflix has a total addressable market of approximately 700m subscribers. However, the company’s current valuation implies that Netflix would have 750m to 1.3bn subscribers by its “end state” in 2026, the bank’s analysts wrote in a note to clients, using a new framework for valuating subscription businesses.
“Overall, our methodology does suggest that if Netflix’s present business model is held constant, the stock is very expensive relative to its [total addressable market],” analysts led by Kannan Venkateshwar said. “While this could be the case, what is more likely in our view is that valuations are more reflective of pricing power and churn declines in the coming years along with additional monetisation options.”
Barclays rates the stock “overweight”, the equivalent of a “buy”, with a price target of $375.
Wall Street’s average price target for Netflix’s shares is $401.21, and out of 39 analysts tracked by FactSet, 28 have “buy” ratings while just two rate Netflix a “sell”. The stock closed at $265.92 Monday after trading as much as 3.3 per cent lower, at $261.89.
Netflix’s shares have struggled in recent weeks as investors reacted to subscriber growth that came up well short of forecasts and braced for new competition from the likes of Apple and Walt Disney.
The company added 2.7m global subscribers in the second quarter. It expected to add 5m users, and analysts forecast 5.1m new subscribers. The quarter marked the first time Netflix had lost subscribers in the US since 2011, after it raised prices as much as 18 per cent earlier this year.
Netflix’s shares are now down less than 1 per cent on the year, having sunk almost 27 per cent since its second-quarter results. At their highest close this year, in May, they were up almost 44 per cent since the end of December.
Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings made note of the encroaching competition at the Royal Television Society conference Friday, saying it would be “a whole new world” beginning in November.
“It’ll be tough competition,” he said, adding he was “a little surprised” it had taken so long for other big media groups to join the fray. Netflix’s stock dropped 5.5 per cent Friday, capping a week in which it lost about 8 per cent of its value.
Apple announced earlier this month its long-awaited subscription video service, Apple TV+, would launch November 1 and cost $4.99 per month. Disney’s service, called Disney+, is set to launch November 12 with a price of $6.99 per month. The least expensive Netflix plan is available for a monthly rate of $8.99.
As it looks to keep pace with rivals, Netflix is spending on new programming and original content. It announced last Monday it acquired exclusive global streaming rights to the iconic sitcom Seinfeld. Also last week, Netflix said it would ramp up its £400m investment in British television programmes.

Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said the UK sector would be a big beneficiary of “a whole new world” of streaming competition in November when big-spending rivals such as Apple and Disney launch their own platforms. 
Admitting Netflix had been too secretive about its data in the past, Mr Hastings for the first time revealed this year’s investment figure in the UK, promising a further “big increase” to a budget second only to that of the US in size. 
“The possibilities the internet brings for growing entertainment is phenomenal, and over the next several years with all of the expansion I think we are going to see a very large increase in how much content is produced here in the UK,” he told the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge. 
The streaming service has made about 50 television shows and films in the UK. 
Netflix is ploughing more of its $8bn programming budget into markets outside the US, spending $1bn in Europe. This month it established a production hub at Pinewood’s Shepperton Studios outside London, where Mary Poppins Returns was shot. 
Disney, which launches its Disney+ streaming platform in November, has also leased prized production space in a deal with Pinewood Studios. 
“For your producers, it is going to be amazing,” Mr Hastings told the industry audience, predicting fierce bidding wars between buyers that would drive up prices for shows. “Some day The Crown will look like a bargain.”

The Netflix founder said his company had been bracing for other big media groups to go toe-to-toe with it over subscription streaming since 2012 and said he was “a little surprised” it had taken so long. 
“It’ll be tough competition,” he added, saying viewers “will have a lot of choice”.
Asked whether there was one show he wished was on Netflix’s roster, Mr Hastings admitted he had been outgunned in the auction for Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, whose rights were won by Amazon in the UK and US. 
Netflix is notoriously guarded about releasing information about its viewing figures and operations. Mr Hastings admitted the company had been too defensive in the past and was “trying to grow up a little”.

Researchers from Northeastern University and Imperial College London found that a number of smart TVs, including those made by Samsung and LG, and the streaming dongles Roku and Amazon’s FireTV were sending out data such as location and IP address to Netflix and third-party advertisers.
The data were being sent whether or not the user had a Netflix account. The researchers also found that other smart devices including speakers and cameras were sending user data to dozens of third parties including Spotify and Microsoft.
The findings are likely to heighten concerns about the privacy of user data on the internet just as smart devices, including televisions, are flooding homes.
In a separate study of smart TVs by Princeton University, researchers found that some apps supported by Roku and FireTV were sending data such as specific user identifiers to third parties including Google.
Roughly 68 per cent of US households had a connected TV device, including external hardware such as Roku and Apple TV, at the end of 2018, according to a Nielsen report from March. Tens of millions of these devices use content recognition technology that tracks everything you watch, to be able to target you better with TV advertising, which now accounts for about half of all digital ads.
The Northeastern University study, conducted on 81 different devices, both in the UK and the US, is the largest published experiment of its kind, and found “notable cases of information exposure”. Amazon, Google, Akamai and Microsoft were the most frequently contacted companies, partly because these companies provide cloud and networking services for smart devices to operate on, the researchers said.
“Amazon is contacted by almost half the devices in our tests, which stands out because [this means] Amazon can infer a lot of information about what you’re doing with different devices in your home, including those they don’t manufacture,” said David Choffnes, computer scientist at Northeastern University and one of the paper’s authors. “They also can have a lot of visibility into what their competitors are doing.”
By analysing network traffic, the Northeastern team concluded that third parties receive, at the very least, information about the device people are using, their locations, and possibly even when they are interacting with it. “So they might know when you’re home and when you’re not,” said Professor Choffnes. 
Because much of the data being sent out by device manufacturers was encrypted, the academics were not aware of exactly what additional data were being transmitted. “They can definitely see some [viewing] is taking place, but what they can exactly see depends on what the manufacturer is sending, which we have not made an attempt to re-engineer,” said Hamed Haddadi, computer scientist at Imperial College and another paper author.
Netflix said: “Information Netflix receives from smart TVs that are not signed in is confined to how Netflix performs and appears on screen. We do not receive any information about other applications or activity on smart TVs.”
Facebook said: “It’s common for devices and apps to send data to the third-party services that are integrated into them. This could, for example, include an app sending data to Facebook to create a login interface, or provide a Like button.”
Google said: “Like other publishers, smart TV app developers can use Google’s ad services to show ads against their content or measure the performance of ads. Depending on the user’s chosen preferences on the device and consents, the publisher may share data with Google’s that’s similar to data used for ads in apps or on the web.” 
Depending on the device manufacturer or the app owner, data sent to Google could include user location, device type and what the user is watching within a specific app so they can be targeted with personalised advertising. 
Experts warn minimal oversight exists of how smart devices store and share personal data. “People are spending more and more time on these devices, and they are placed in such critical places in people’s homes, so we need to hold them to account,” said Max Van Kleek, computer scientist at the University of Oxford, who works on smart devices and was not involved with either research paper. “The situation is dire.”

Independent UK producers made record revenues of more than £3bn in 2018, up 10 per cent from the previous year, according to industry body Pact.
The boom was largely driven by an increase in commissions from foreign media groups, which over the five years to 2018 almost doubled their spending with British producers.
Netflix shows commissioned in the UK in recent years include The Crown, Sex Education and Black Mirror. Streaming companies were behind 40 per cent of the £962m spent on UK-made content by foreign companies in 2018.
“There is an insatiable demand for great content and people who can make it to the quality that audiences want,” said John McVay, chief executive of Pact. Within roughly five years he expects foreign buyers to spend as much on UK-made content as domestic broadcasters.
The rapid growth of Netflix has pushed media groups from Disney and Apple to the BBC and ITV to launch their own streaming services, further ramping up demand for original programming to attract audiences that have an ever-growing supply of entertainment options.
Jane Root, founder and chief executive of British producer Nutopia, said the changing media landscape was “incredibly good for independent producers”. She said her company, which a few years ago was mainly working for public service broadcasters and US cable networks, was now making shows for Netflix, Amazon and Disney+, “so we are right in the heart of this transition”.
The BBC needs to think carefully as we have a growing number of buyers across the globe and we can take our best projects elsewhere
Tax relief for UK-made film and television shows introduced in 2016 has also contributed to the production boom that has transformed Britain into a global hub of filmed entertainment, according to a report commissioned last year by the British Film Institute.
Britain’s creative industries are braced for new costs after Brexit. The UK’s plan to end free movement of EU nationals means the sector, like others, is expected to have to apply for visas to bring skilled European workers to Britain.
However, “the pound-to-dollar exchange is very beneficial to our American partners”, said Ms Root. “It is not a good moment for Britain but it is for our clients.”
Mr McVay said his biggest concern was the conflict between British independent producers and the BBC over the broadcaster’s move to extend the programming window of its iPlayer online service from 30 days to one year.
Recommended
The publicly funded broadcaster is in talks with producers over compensation for keeping shows and films in their online catalogue for longer, while also trying to push through rules that would give BritBox, its joint streaming service with ITV, first rights to BBC programmes once they come off iPlayer.
“The BBC needs to think carefully as we have a growing number of buyers across the globe and we can take our best projects elsewhere,” said Mr McVay.
However, the broadcaster dismissed suggestions it might lose out, insisting “there are plenty of good ideas out there and there is no shortage of them being pitched to the BBC”.
The public service broadcasters — the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 — dominate domestic spending on UK-made content but their spending has fallen and their share fell 10 percentage points to 80 per cent in the decade to 2018, with groups such as Sky investing more. Total domestic expenditure remained flat over the past year despite the BBC spending an extra £240m on original programmes.

https://www.ft.com/content/bf1b6cfa-c599-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9,Patricia Nilsson,Netflix hooked on reality TV in battle with broadcasters,2019-08-25,16:49:18,"Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have beefed up their UK offerings of reality shows, moving in on a genre that traditionally has acted as a battleground for broadcasters targeting younger viewers. 
The total number of hours of game, lifestyle and other types of unscripted shows on the British platforms of the two entertainment giants has quadrupled over the past two years, according to data from Ampere Analysis. 
Reality shows accounted for 5 per cent of Amazon’s UK programmes in June 2019, up from one per cent in the summer of 2017. Netflix, meanwhile, increased its reality content by one percentage point to four per cent, according to Ampere.
The trend could prove a blow to terrestrial broadcasters that increasingly view reality TV — which include the likes of Netflix’s Queer Eye and Amazon’s The Grand Tour, hosted by Jeremy Clarkson — as a crucial weapon in the fight to keep younger viewers from switching to global on-demand platforms.
ITV, for instance, said last month it would add a winter edition of its hit show Love Island, which garnered average audience figures of 5.5m, and had helped the broadcaster limit sliding advertising revenues. The BBC, which has said younger viewers are increasingly difficult to reach, this year launched The Reality Tea, a podcast that discusses gossip from reality shows.
Daniel Gadher, research manager at Ampere Analysis, said streaming platforms’ growing focus on reality shows indicated they were trying to take on traditional broadcasters for a specific audience group. 
“Platforms have been broadening their mix of programmes as they look to appeal to different demographics,” he said.
Almost half of all British homes now subscribe to online streaming services, which contrasts with what the UK’s media regulator Ofcom has called the “accelerating” decline of interest in traditional television.
Two in five British adults with a streaming subscription said they “can imagine not watching broadcast TV at all” in five years, according to an Ofcom report on the country’s viewing habits published earlier this month. 
But viewers have diverging appetites for reality TV. Roughly a quarter of Brits surveyed by Ofcom said the quality of television had worsened over the past year, with almost half of those citing “too many reality shows” as a reason. However, alongside thrillers, the genre was nevertheless the most viewed on Amazon Prime this year, according to data cited by the regulator.
Newer short-form streaming platforms such as Snapchat and the soon-to-launch Quibi — the latest venture from DreamWorks Animation co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg — have also been investing in the genre.
Figures from Ampere on reality shows currently in production revealed that the BBC and Channel 4 are the top commissioners. But Snapchat and Netflix follow, with Quibi, which is set to launch in 2020, close behind.
“They are capitalising on a boom in interest among youth audiences, perhaps driven by shows such as Love Island,” said Mr Gadher.

Now the strategy that has taken it to the commanding heights of Hollywood is starting to look more shaky.
The company has posted the first drop in subscribers in its core US market since 2011, when the company split off its DVD business and prepared the transition to online video. Its shares closed 10.3 per cent lower on Thursday after it revealed it had lost 130,000 US customers in the second quarter. It was the worst day for the stock price in three years, wiping more than $15bn from Netflix’s market value. 
The weak subscriber numbers could not have come at a worse time for the California-based company, stoking fears that Netflix is losing momentum just as Disney, Apple, HBO and NBCUniversal are ready to pounce with their own streaming services, which will launch in the coming months. 
“Does it make us more nervous? Of course — especially given the timing of the Disney+ launch,” said Todd Juenger, analyst at Bernstein. “If Netflix misses subs in the quarters after Disney+ launches . . . we expect the downside effect on Netflix stock will be several times more than usual.”
The results also prod at the heart of Netflix’s business model. The company has delighted investors despite burning $3bn in cash a year, promising that margins would improve as it hooked more customers and raised subscription prices, meaning it would no longer need to keep raising high-yield debt to fund its shows. This week’s results have thrown that thesis into question. 
Netflix raised prices in the US this year by as much as 18 per cent, a move cheered by investors. But the subscriber defections suggest demand is more elastic than executives thought. The price of a standard Netflix subscription now costs $13 a month — a dollar higher than for rival Hulu. 
While Netflix already has a strong grip in its home country, with more than 60m Americans paying for a subscription, analysts have predicted that number could keep rising to as many as 90m. 
As recently as last month, media research group MoffettNathanson estimated the company would reach 88.4m US subscribers by 2025. But on Thursday it warned “that scenario looks downright psychedelic”. 
“This one quarter calls into question many of those 2025 endpoints,” said partner Michael Nathanson, adding that the results bring into question “Netflix’s ultimate pricing power”.
Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant one
Netflix blamed the miss on a weak content offering during the quarter, without elaborating, and Reed Hastings, chief executive, had little in the way of explanation. 
“It wasn’t just one thing,” Mr Hastings said on an earnings call. “It's easy to over-interpret the quarterly [subscriber] adds, which are a bit noisy.”
Netflix says the picture will improve as its flagship shows return with new seasons. The second quarter is usually Netflix’s weakest, and the third brings the return of worldwide hits Orange is the New Black and Stranger Things, with The Crown to follow later in the year. 
But the business is likely to become more challenging as the new wave of rival services looms. From November, Disney’s streaming service will offer thousands of shows and films from popular franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel — at about half the price of a Netflix subscription.
In the next two years, Netflix is also losing fan favourites Friends and The Office, to WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal, respectively. The sitcoms are the number one and two most-watched shows on the platform, according to Nielsen. Netflix has brushed off the issue, arguing the losses would “free up budget for more original content”. 
The global numbers also disappointed. The 2.7m subscribers added worldwide in the second quarter fell well short of Wall Street forecasts for 5.1m new users. 
Netflix’s long-term debt stood at $12.6bn at the end of June, up from $10.3bn in March. It has forecast a free cash burn of more than $3bn this year, although it expects an improvement after that. 
“In the meantime, our plan is still to use high-yield debt to fund our content investments,” the company said, doubling down on its strategy to pump money into its own shows and films to further expand its 152m global subscriber base. Analysts expect the company to invest $15bn in content this year alone.

Until now the company has remained a darling of investors. Although the threat of competition and the recent price rises amount to what JPMorgan analysts called a “wall of worry” around the stock, Netflix shares gained more than 35 per cent this year before peaking in May, compared with a 20 per cent rise for the benchmark

But observers are now wondering whether the golden age of Netflix is losing its sheen. 
“Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant one,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Missing expectations just when competition for viewers is hotting up is doubly worrying and doubly painful.”

The company added 2.7m subscribers globally in the three months ending in June — well below its guidance for 5m additions and Wall Street forecasts for 5.1m new users. 
Netflix also revealed that it had lost subscribers in the US for the first time since 2011, as customers defected after price rises of as much as 18 per cent earlier this year. 
“There was no one thing” to explain the decline, said Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, adding that “if investors believe in internet TV . . . our position in the market is very strong”. 
Investors showed their disappointment with the results on Wall Street, sending shares down more than 11 per cent in midday trading. 
“Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant one,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Missing expectations just when competition for viewers is hotting up is doubly worrying and doubly painful.”
In the US, its largest market, Netflix lost 130,000 subscribers in the quarter. The company in January raised prices for all US customers. The price of a standard Netflix subscription now costs $13 a month — a dollar higher than rival Hulu. 
California-based Netflix already has a strong grip in its home country, with more than 60m Americans paying for a Netflix subscription. But the latest results “could point to potential saturation in the [US] market,” said Patrice Cucinello, director at Fitch.
Netflix blamed its content slate for the large miss, while adding that its forecasts “strive for accuracy (not conservatism)”.
The company said that it expected the US to return to “more typical growth” in the third quarter, during which two of its biggest original hits, Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black, return with new seasons. Netflix expects to add 800,000 US subscribers in the period.
Netflix has continued to pump billions of dollars into its own shows and films. Analysts expect the company to invest $15bn in content this year. It has justified the splurge with fast subscriber growth: at the end of June, Netflix had 152m subscribers across the globe.
However Netflix’s disappointing quarter comes as the company faces looming competition in the streaming market it pioneered. Disney, Apple, AT&T and Comcast’s NBCUniversal are preparing to unveil rival services in the coming months.

As the streaming battle heats up, some fan favourites will be pulled from Netflix as media companies claw their content away from the service. NBCUniversal last month announced it had taken the rights back for The Office, starting in 2021, while WarnerMedia is pulling Friends from Netflix next year. 
Netflix on Wednesday brushed off the threat, instead arguing that the losses of these shows would “free up budget for more original content”. 
It reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 60 cents a share, on revenue of $4.9bn. Analysts were looking for 56 cents a share on sales of $4.9bn. 
The company uses debt to help finance its heavy spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $12.6bn at the end of June, up from $10.3bn in March. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that. “In the meantime, our plan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments,” the company said.

“We’ve been mindful about the ongoing debate around the show,” Netflix wrote on Twitter, adding that “on the advice of medical experts”, it has edited out a scene from the show’s first season which originally aired in 2017. The three-minute scene shows high school student Hannah taking her own life in a bathtub.
13 Reasons Why is based on a best-selling novel of the same name, in which Hannah creates 13 tapes for classmates explaining why she ended her life. 
The series garnered critical praise but also drew backlash over its treatment of its controversial subject matter, with mental health experts and school administrators arguing that it romanticises suicide and could trigger vulnerable teenagers. 
Netflix’s move to delete the scene follows a study in April funded by the National Institute of Health, the US government agency, which found a 29 per cent spike in US teen suicides in the month following the show’s debut.
At the time, Netflix said that the company was “looking into the research” and working to “handle this sensitive issue responsibly”. 
Netflix consulted mental health groups including the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, which informed Tuesday’s decision to edit out the scene. 
Recommended
Changing a television show years later is a rare move. Netflix’s decision illustrates the different viewing habits of streaming versus traditional television, said people familiar with the plan. With a new season of 13 Reasons Why coming this summer, Netflix executives were mindful that some people may watch the show from the start for the first time on the streaming platform, which is why they changed a scene that debuted years ago, these people said.
In March, Netflix retroactively removed a scene from its hit film, Bird Box, which used stock footage from a real-life Canadian train explosion that had killed 47 people in 2013. The use of footage of the tragedy had sparked outrage from Canadians, with parliament condemning Netflix.
The creators of 13 Reasons Why have previously argued that their aim was to push a discussion around the difficult subject. Two weeks after the show debuted in 2017, seven Colorado students killed themselves, and the school district asked librarians to ban the book. Brian Yorkey, the show’s creator, at the time said that “many people are accusing the show of glamorising suicide and I feel strongly . . . that we did the exact opposite”.
13 Reasons Why is co-produced by Anonymous Content and Viacom-owned Paramount Television. Pop star Selena Gomez was an executive producer and heavily promoted the show at its start; she has defended the series, telling a radio show in 2017 that it is “honest” and “stays true to the book”.

The Australian has spent four years in charge of marketing high-profile BBC television shows across the world, including Doctor Who, Sherlock, Top Gear and Planet Earth, as well as developing the broadcaster’s social media strategy. 
She will move to Los Angeles for the Netflix role, focusing on the company’s international strategy. The US company produces TV in 30 countries and wants to unearth more shows that can have an international reach, such as the German thriller Dark and the British comedy Sex Education. 
She is the latest new face at Netflix after Rachel Whetstone joined from Facebook last August to head up its global communications operations and Spencer Neumann was appointed chief financial officer in January after he left video games company Activision Blizzard. 
Recommended
Ms Lee-Joe replaces Kelly Bennett who said in March that he would retire after six years at Netflix. She will report to Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer. 
“Jackie is a truly original thinker with a wealth of global experience — making her the perfect fit as our next chief marketing officer,” said Mr Sarandos. 
Netflix’s marketing budget is forecast to increase to almost $3bn this year as it continues to push its international growth strategy. The media company is devoting more of its $8bn programming budget outside of the US, including $1bn in Europe, and this month established a production hub at Pinewood’s Shepperton studios outside London.
Ms Lee-Joe is the second executive to leave BBC Studios, the commercial arm of the government-funded UK broadcaster, in recent weeks after Ann Sarnoff joined movie studio Warner Bros as chief executive. 
She joined BBC Studios as chief marketing officer in 2015 from Skype.
Ms Lee-Joe, a graduate of the University of Sydney, started her career in Australia with the airline Ansett and Virgin Mobile. She later worked for Carphone Warehouse and Orange before joining Skype.

AT&T-owned WarnerMedia on Tuesday revealed details about its own streaming service, which aims to win back customers from Netflix. 
The service, called HBO Max, is set to launch in the spring of 2020 with the exclusive rights to HBO’s full library, Time Warner’s television classics such as Friends and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, as well as new films produced by Hollywood heavyweights Greg Berlanti and Reese Witherspoon. 
After years of watching consumers shift their attention away from traditional television and towards Netflix, traditional media companies are fighting back. Walt Disney and AT&T have between them spent more than $150bn on megadeals to build up their arsenals of content, and are working to launch their own streaming services within the next year. 
Media companies must choose what content to restrict to their own streaming services, and what to keep available on platforms like Netflix where hundreds of millions of people might watch it. This will not only determine how valuable their streaming services might be — it will also directly impact revenues. MoffettNathanson analysts predict Disney’s streaming push will slice revenues for its film studio and media networks units by $1.4bn in fiscal 2020. 
As the streaming battle heats up, some fan favourites will be pulled from Netflix. Last month Comcast-owned NBCUniversal announced it had taken the rights back for The Office starting in 2021. The Office and Friends are the two most-watched programmes on Netflix, according to Nielsen.
Last year Netflix warned customers Friends could be taken down from its platform soon, sparking fury among fans. However Netflix struck a deal with AT&T to extend its rights to the sitcom for another year, paying nearly $100m for it. 
Netflix said in a tweet it was “sorry to see Friends go to Warner’s streaming service at the beginning of 2020 (in The US)”.

Streaming old episodes of Friends is not going to trigger an existential crisis about privacy, misinformation and the dangers of the digital world. While governments wonder how to tackle the fraught issues thrown up by our online lives, Netflix has stayed under the radar. 
That lack of political heat puts the company in a position to speak out on polarising issues. This week, Netflix declared that it would rethink its investment in Georgia if the US state’s anti-abortion law takes effect. “We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer. As the first of only a handful of companies to take a stand, Netflix is due praise. 
Such interventions only carry weight because, in the space of just two decades, Netflix has transformed from a start-up into a company with a $150bn market capitalisation. And yet, while Netflix has not been dragged into the debates over data and privacy, there are reasons for investors not be so forgiving of its business model.
The company is burning through colossal amounts of cash to amass the TV shows and movies needed to hook viewers. It is not unusual to see a new, fast-growing Silicon Valley company with costs exceeding the cash it generates — but Netflix has outgrown that camp.

		from large, established companies has re-emerged as a sensitive issue on the West Coast thanks to Uber’s unhappy debut on the stock market. When the car-booking company tried to justify its cash burn by comparing itself to Amazon it was shouted down. Amazon may have delivered years of losses but, unlike Uber, it was generating the cash to help maintain its giddy growth.
Netflix does not throw off the cash required to support a business model whose ambition has taken it from scrappy DVD rental business to the world’s most successful streaming service.
Recommended
Yet the unwelcome third act for Netflix has been the arrival of the likes of Disney, Amazon and Apple each intent on building rival streaming services with their own content. What’s more, Mediaset, the Italian broadcaster controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, this week announced a stake in ProSiebenSat.1, Germany’s largest commercial broadcaster, in what was seen as the first step in an effort to create a pan-European competitor. As threats grow, Netflix is paying billions of dollars to build a catalogue of original programmes such as The Crown, the hugely popular royal drama. 
But big cheques do not guarantee pop culture hits: a new glossy, yet boring, neo-noir starring Renée Zellweger is proof of that. Helpfully for Netflix, the sheer volume of shows it makes mean that its fortunes do not rest on a single series.
Churning out content requires a supply of fresh funding from debt markets — bond investors coughed up $2bn in April — and deals with programme makers. Mention this to Netflix and you will hear that all entertainment companies are run in the same way. Disney, though, funds its own expansion. Netflix hopes to do so soon, but that will require subscribers to resist the temptation of rival streaming services. 
Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive and co-founder, appears untroubled. Rivals such as Apple and Disney are “awesome companies,” he says; Netflix’s debt is an opportunity for investors who “better get in soon because there’s not going to be that much more to go”. Rising subscriber numbers have equalled a rising share price. It is up more than 30 per cent this year.
Yet this cushion offers only an illusion of security. Market capitalisation is not an asset to draw on when times are tough. Netflix is old enough to stand on its own two feet. Cash flow, not further share price gains, would provide the real feelgood factor.

		to focus on the company’s powerful brand, strong growth and chunky equity market capitalisation of $168bn.
“I think people look at the market cap of the business,” said one investor. “It gives people an enormous comfort. The company is spending a large amount of money to build a library of content and there is a cost associated with that.”
Over time the company has said it will reduce its reliance on bond markets. During an earnings call last week, Netflix executives flagged plans to slow debt issuance in 2020 as it looks to become “self-funded”. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said: “I think the message to debt investors is, you better [get] in soon, because there’s not going to be that much more to go.” 
S&P analyst Jawad Hussein expects that Netflix’s cash flow deficit will shrink to between $2bn and $2.5bn next year, but that the company will still have to issue “at least $3bn” in debt to cover its costs and provide a cushion of cash. 
Recommended
“They’re balancing growth versus investment, and we understand that. It’s quite expensive to create so much content,” Mr Hussein said. “However, in 2020, if we don’t see a material improvement in cash flow deficit, that would be a worrying sign. That would point to either slow growth because of more competition from Disney and others, or [Netflix] having to spend more to grow internationally and spend more on content.”
The new debt is likely to be priced with a coupon of around 5.63 per cent in the US and a slightly lower coupon in Europe due to the lower level of benchmark interest rates there, according to initial discussions with investors. That is slightly above the average yield on BB-rated bonds in the US at the moment, which stands at around 4.75 per cent. 
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo are running the bond sale.

The video streaming service signed up 9.6m subscribers in the first three months of the year, ahead of forecasts and coming within a whisker of 150m customers around the world. 
Its expectation for the second quarter, though, was a net addition of 5m subscribers, lower than the 6m analysts had predicted. Netflix shares were modestly lower in after-hours trading. 
The lighter forecast comes as Netflix faces looming competition in the streaming video market it pioneered.
Disney last week unveiled plans for a new streaming service for about half the price of a standard Netflix subscription, sending Disney’s shares soaring. Apple last month made a similarly splashy announcement for its own streaming service. Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia and Comcast are all planning to launch services in the coming year. 
That was not the reason for the lighter guidance, however. Addressing Disney and Apple’s move on to its turf in a letter to investors, Netflix said: “We don’t anticipate that these new entrants will materially affect our growth . . . We believe there is vast demand for watching great TV and movies and Netflix only satisfies a small portion of that demand.”
Netflix raised prices for all customers in the US, its largest market, in a move that was cheered by investors at the time. For its most popular tier, which offers video in high-definition, prices rose by $2 a month to $13 — a dollar more than rival Hulu’s ad-free subscription. 
Netflix said that the response to the price changes in the US was “as we expected”. More than 1.7m of the 9.6m new customers in the first quarter came from the US, where prices rose up to 18 per cent. 
Revenue in the first three months of the year jumped 22 per cent to $4.52bn, versus consensus forecasts for $4.5bn. Net income climbed 19 per cent to $344m for the quarter, or 76 cents a share on a diluted basis.
As Netflix spend billions to make shows and films, routinely outbidding traditional Hollywood studios, it has justified the splurge with fast subscriber growth. The strategy has paid off: as of the end of March, Netflix had 149m subscribers across the globe, giving it a big head-start on Disney and Apple.

Netflix uses debt to help finance its heavy spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $10.3bn at the end of March. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that. 
The company highlighted some of the fruits of this investment in the quarter including Triple Frontier, an original Netflix film starring Ben Affleck. Netflix claims the action movie was watched in more than 52m households in its first four weeks on the service.

As the company snaps up the most sought-after scripts and ideas, it is signing longer-lasting rights deals than traditional broadcasters and staggering payments for shows over several years, according to people familiar with the strategy. 
Regulatory filings show that over the next five years Netflix will drip-feed a total of $19.3bn to producers for new shows and to license TV that has already been made.
For producers, this is a departure from old norms of accounts being settled in full on delivery, and it means having to take out longer-term loans to finance new shows. 
For the banks providing that financing, this is also new territory: longer-term loans are inherently riskier than short-term ones and Netflix, as the ultimate payer, is a riskier proposition than traditional broadcasters. Its

		 double-B, deems it below investment grade — but banks are proving enthusiastic about getting exposure to the streaming revolution.
“Historically we have lent against the likes of ITV or BBC, where we were lending on a shorter term and with a counterparty that had a strong credit rating,” said Lorraine Ruckstuhl, head of media at Barclays Corporate Banking. “When you are dealing with a growing but levered business like Netflix the external ratings are not as strong, so you need to really understand the strategy of the business and manage the risk. Which we do.”
Barclays in London is one of the banks stepping up to provide this longer-term credit, often between three and four years in duration versus a few months under the old model. Its biggest public loan was £17.5m to Forgiving Earth Ltd, a co-producer of Black Earth Rising, a legal drama series that takes place during the Rwandan genocide.
JPMorgan and City National Bank of Los Angeles are also among the willing lenders to producers of streamed content.
Typically, loans have been for between £3m and £30m, bankers said, and syndicates of banks have combined for larger financings. Smaller productions are rarely financed by banks because the legal fees, interest payments and other associated costs become prohibitive. 
Neil Begley, vice-president at Moody’s, says Netflix is “strong-arming” producers to avoid adding more debt to its own balance sheet. “One way to do that is to say: we’ll pay you, but we want you to do the financing until it’s ready.”
Netflix declined to comment, but a person close to the company said: “Netflix pays market, and often top of market, to work with the best producers. This is a seller’s market for them with more competition than ever before.”

Last year there were 495 original scripted series released, compared to just 288 in 2012 — and the vast majority of these new shows were made for streaming services. 
For lenders to production companies, a central concern is the creditworthiness of Netflix and the other streaming businesses that are buying all this content. The terms on offer suggest optimism about the sector despite the fast-shifting media landscape. Loans for shows produced for Netflix have interest rates of 5 to 6 per cent, bankers said, only a nudge more than Netflix’s corporate bonds, adjusted for relative maturities.
“The risk is if they were to lose subscribers and go downhill, they’ve locked themselves into a certain amount of expenditure for years to come,” said Mr Begley. “Can they let that burn off fast enough before destroying their margins? I’m not as concerned about it today as I was three or four years ago.”
Producers say the staggered payment system suits them just fine when financing is available at relatively modest interest rates. Mick Pilsworth, a veteran TV executive who commissioned programmes such as Midsomer Murders and a Jeremy Clarkson chat show, said that “increasingly now there is a market for lending for productions . . . It is ramping up because of Netflix”.

Drawing upon the company’s rich history in the 70-year-old soundstage where classics such as the original Mary Poppins were filmed, chief executive Bob Iger made his case to investors for a new streaming business on which Disney expects to lose money for the next five years. 
The streaming service, called Disney+, will feature shows and films from its popular franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel and cost $7 a month, or less than $6 a month with an annual contract — compared to $13 a month for a standard Netflix subscription. 
The service, which will not show advertising, launches on November 12 in the US and globally over the next few years. Disney vowed to invest more than $1bn in fiscal 2020 to produce shows to persuade fans of its popular franchises to sign up. 
Disney will offer a streaming platform that “no other content or technology company can rival”, Mr Iger declared on a dark purple sound stage in front of a gargantuan screen. 
60m-90m
Disney’s subscriber number goal by 2024 for its streaming service
Citing a time of “extraordinary” change in entertainment, Mr Iger nodded to the legacy of Walt Disney, the group’s founder, who had set a precedent to “create change, not just to sit back and watch it happen”. 
The company expects it will draw between 60m and 90m subscribers by fiscal 2024. 
Mr Iger has bet the company, and his legacy, on a push to counter the forces of Netflix and other technology groups that have upended Hollywood. The 68-year-old delayed his retirement to steer Disney through the transition, after in 2017 announcing that Disney would create its own streaming platform and yank its shows from Netflix. 
Since then, Disney has dropped hints about the service, described by Mr Iger as the “number one priority”, but Thursday’s investor day on Disney’s studio lot offered the first real glimpse at the gamble. 
Kevin Mayer, a rumoured successor to Mr Iger, walked investors through a prototype of the service, which looked similar to streaming sites such as Netflix and Amazon, with rows of movies and television shows set against a dark grey background. 
Disney+ aims to appeal to fans of its popular franchise, grouping them into five buttons at the top of the screen for Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. 
In addition to Disney+, which aims to appeal to families, Disney is also offering ESPN+, the sports streaming service, and Hulu as a separate platform. The company is “likely” to bundle the three together at a discount, Mr Mayer said. 
Disney’s event comes a few weeks after Apple made a splashy presentation for its own streaming service featuring Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. Unlike Apple, Disney did not bring out the stars. Instead, Disney executives spent three hours teasing the shows that it hopes would lure fans to the service. 
By 2020 Disney+ would offer more than 500 films and 75,000 television episodes, including all six original Star Wars films, 18 Pixar films and the full library of The Simpsons. 
Disney’s push into streaming comes as the traditional television business has stalled, spurring media companies to re-evaluate their strategies. Mr Mayer pointed to a chart showing that global video streaming subscribers are projected to grow to 810m in 2020, from 20m in 2010*. 
Recommended
AT&T, after sealing a blockbuster acquisition of Time Warner, and Comcast’s NBCUniversal are also planning to unveil streaming services later this year. Disney also faces the incumbent streaming powerhouse, Netflix, which already has 139m subscribers, as well as Apple. 
“Investors essentially want to understand whether Disney can make the transition to a tech company,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG. “Or will this be yet another technology failure, not just for Disney but for the broader legacy media universe.”
Disney’s streaming push is expensive. In addition to the costs of investing in content and technology, Disney estimates it will lose $150m in licensing money a year by pulling its programming from Netflix. 
Disney is betting that the money from subscriptions will eventually outweigh these losses, and expects Disney+ to be profitable by fiscal 2024. 
*This story has been amended since original publication to state that global video streaming subscribers are projected to grow to 810m in 2020.

https://www.ft.com/content/e2861a04-5475-11e9-8b71-f5b0066105fe,Nirpal Dhaliwal,Can Amazon and Netflix succeed in India?,2019-04-10,04:00:32,"Two weary policemen — an experienced detective and his eager-to-learn junior inspector — drive through the night-time cityscape. Almost lost for words, they begin discussing the horrifying murder they’re charged with solving, struggling to comprehend how such evil erupted into their world. It feels like any other gritty Netflix detective drama but for one crucial difference: it’s Indian.
This year has seen an acceleration in foreign competition for the country’s TV market, with both Amazon and Netflix launching big-budget original series, and each announcing a broad slate of future content that, while rooted in India, has clear appeal across a world in which geography and language are no longer barriers to enjoyment. 
Following the international success of shows such as Narcos, the 2015 crime series set in Colombia and Mexico, and the Israeli spy drama Fauda, came Amazon’s 2018 Indian mobster epic Mirzapur and Netflix’s Mumbai-noir series, Sacred Games — further proof of the global appetite for stories with a local flavour.
Before the arrival of online streaming platforms, Indian television was already a smorgasbord of channels, from regional local-language stations to Hindi-language pay channels, including the Disney-owned StarPlus, Sony Entertainment and Zee, and the public broadcaster Doordarshan. The appetite for these services remains ravenous. The biggest shows of recent decades have been soapy family melodramas such as Kasautii Zindagii Kay (The Trials Of Life) (2001) and domestic sitcoms such as Hum Paanch (We Five) (1995). There was no western-style “golden era” of Indian television — no incisively written dramas such as Mad Men or The Sopranos.
Last month, though, both Amazon and Netflix launched shows created and produced by Indians that address the country’s contemporary reality — if from opposite ends of the societal spectrum. Amazon’s Made In Heaven is a high-gloss, mostly English-language production that tells stories from the creamiest layer of Indian society through the lens of an upscale wedding-planning business. Not unlike Sex and the City, it explores relationships, sexuality — including homosexuality — and conspicuous consumption, with a sassy cast of strong and sharp-tongued female characters and a lot of carnal intrigue.
Meanwhile Delhi Crime, Netflix’s big new Indian show, is, like True Detective, a hard-boiled cop series that peers into the dark heart of society through the investigations of a jaded police officer. It was inspired by the 2012 gang rape and murder of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh Pandey, who was kidnapped and tortured aboard a private bus, a crime that led to a national and international outcry.
Though the new arrivals mostly target the small but exploding young urban audience, and so are not in direct competition with the biggest existing Indian broadcasters and on-demand services such as Hotstar and ZEE5, the competition for subscribers is intense. Amazon Prime Video costs 129 rupees (about £1.42) per month, cheaper even than Hotstar, whose plans begin at 199 rupees. Netflix charges substantially more at 500 rupees per month. (Last year India’s per capita income was 113,000 rupees, or about £1,245.)
While neither company will divulge subscriber numbers or viewing figures for individual shows, both have seen their Indian content avidly consumed overseas. Gaurav Gandhi, Amazon Prime’s director and country manager for India, says of Breathe, a serial-killer series released last January, “one-third of the viewers came from outside India. And we’re getting a lot of love abroad for Made in Heaven. It’s there in the reviews and the chatter. The growth in interest has been very organic.”
Despite being substantially in English, Made in Heaven hasn’t compromised on authenticity. “It’s the language of that class of society,” Zoya Akhtar, one of the series’ creators, tells me. “And the appeal is universal, because wedding planning is pure theatre . . . It’s a great scenario for drama.”

		Viacom18, joined Amazon last year as part of a wave of new hires in the region by US streamers. Last year, Netflix recruited Simran Sethi as its creative director for India.
It is not only English-language Indian shows that have enjoyed wider success. Netflix’s Hindi-language horror series Ghoul found a strong non-Hindi-speaking audience in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, where “45 per cent of viewers watched it with English subtitles, and 37 per cent with English dubbing,” according to Sethi. The numbers and reviews point to a growing worldwide taste for Indian content beyond the country’s large expat communities.
Sethi also points to Netflix’s algorithms, which suggest new shows to subscribers based on their past viewing habits, but which can also steer viewers towards more international material. “The curation within the platform brings the right content to the right viewer,” she says. “If you watched a horror show like [the US-made] The Haunting of Hill House, Netflix will offer you Ghoul as another show in that genre. Viewers can enjoy the genres they like with new settings . . . The platform allows you to discover these. My mum is a big fan of Korean family dramas that are now hugely popular in India and the US.”
One thing that separates the new streaming shows from traditional Indian TV is that, being internet-delivered, they are exempt from the control of India’s Central Board of Film Classification, which bans bad language and candid portrayals of sex and violence. The country’s TV (like its big-screen counterpart, Bollywood) has often shied away from challenging portrayals of Indian life — especially of women. In the new context, though, directors such as Zoya Akhtar are able to tell authentic female stories.
“We wanted to talk about things that affect women. And with Amazon we don’t have censorship. We have a very long format with which we can really delve into things. We can have lovemaking, sex and real language. And there’s no pressure of the box office.”
Where terrestrial TV had to cater for a broad multigenerational viewership, now, with internet access, younger people increasingly watch TV away from their parents and grandparents. “Three hundred million people here now have smartphones. Online video is as mainstream as traditional television,” says Vikram Malhotra, chief executive of Abundantia Entertainment, which produced Amazon’s Breathe. “It’s been brilliant to work with progressive-minded talent, who are nonconformist and in tune with the younger demographic.” 
Buoyed by its successes in the region, Netflix has announced six original Indian series, including Baahubali, a fantasy epic not unlike Game of Thrones, and the ghost story Typewriter. Meanwhile, Amazon is casting A-list Bollywood stars with global profiles: Abhishek Bachchan will be joining season two of Breathe; action hero Akshay Kumar will front The End, a series in development with Abundantia, also for Amazon.
For now, Netflix and Amazon’s venture in India remains an experiment, but it’s one that looks promising. It helps that the country’s top names are jumping into the TV arena, just like their counterparts in Hollywood. And also that the country has a rich history of bringing stories to the screen. 
“There has always been such amazing storytelling talent in India,” says Sethi, “and people can now tell their stories on their own terms to the whole world.”

Makan Delrahim, the justice department’s antitrust chief, last month wrote to Dawn Hudson, the Academy’s chief executive, warning that any changes to Oscar eligibility rules could spark antitrust concerns, according to a person familiar with the letter.
The move by Mr Delrahim came ahead of the Academy’s board of governors meeting later this month, where Steven Spielberg, the film-maker and Academy board member, is expected to try and change the rules on what films are eligible for consideration at the Oscars.
Mr Spielberg has criticised the inclusion of movies that largely play on streaming sites like Netflix, rather than primarily in theatres.
In the March 21 letter, first reported by Variety and confirmed by a person familiar with its contents, Mr Delrahim said any eligibility requirements that did not have a “procompetitive justification” could “raise antitrust concerns”.
He noted that the Academy’s membership included several competitors, and said an agreement to exclude other rivals could violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which deals with illegal restraints on trade.
“If the Academy adopts a new rule to exclude certain types of films, such as films distributed via online streaming services, from eligibility for the Oscars, and that exclusion tends to diminish the excluded films’ sales, that rule could therefore violate Section 1,” said Mr Delrahim in the letter, according to the person familiar.
An Academy spokesperson confirmed the letter and said it had responded, without offering further details.
“The Academy’s Board of Governors will meet on April 23 for its annual awards rules meeting, where all branches submit possible updates for consideration,” the spokesperson added.
“The Antitrust Division regularly expresses its views when it learns of potential practices that may violate the antitrust laws,” said a justice department spokesperson. “Many organizations also seek the Division’s guidance on proposed practices through Business Review Letters and other means.”

https://www.ft.com/content/7be7cc00-4c9d-11e9-bbc9-6917dce3dc62,Tim Bradshaw,Big Tech competes to be the Netflix of gaming,2019-03-22,18:19:34,"In common with tens of millions of people around the world, Fortnite keeps Netflix boss Reed Hastings up at night. Unlike everyone else, he is not enjoying the experience.
Netflix was the troublemaker that barged into Hollywood with a Silicon Valley formula for creating new content, distributing existing TV shows and movies, stealing eyeballs and dominating our leisure time. 
Now, Mr Hastings frets that Netflix is itself being disrupted by Fortnite — an addictive, multiplayer, online “battle royale” shooting game that has evolved into a social media platform and is so explosively popular that, if its roughly 250m global user base were a country, it would be the fifth largest in the world. 
“We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO,” the Netflix chief executive said in a letter to shareholders in January. “Our growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen time experiences from which consumers choose.”
If games are already luring Netflix’s audience away, Mr Hastings may be unnerved to learn that the interactive entertainment industry is now looking to steal his business model, too. A heavyweight army of tech groups is jostling to position itself as the “Netflix of games”, made up of individual developers and publishers such as Electronic Arts and Rovio spin-off Hatch to some of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, including Google, Microsoft and Apple. 
The land grab is making video games one of the most dynamic and competitive markets in the tech industry. Over the coming 18 months, according to bankers across three continents, it is also likely to be a battleground for mergers and acquisition activity as the competition heats up for control of content. 
“Gaming is far more than just a game — it is a new media format,” says Bruce Stein, chief executive of aXiomatic, an investor in Fortnite’s developer, Epic Games, and Niantic, the creator of Pokémon Go. “Anybody who looks at gaming has to be aware of the amount of time it’s consuming, with each generation now growing. If they don’t put it into their mix, they are likely to be victimised by it.” 
As well as being the entertainment industry’s biggest disrupter, the games market — which is worth nearly $140bn a year in sales — is entering its own period of seismic change. 
Google this week unveiled a new cloud gaming platform, Stadia, which is formidable in scale and ambition, promising the ability to play any game, any time, anywhere. While some analysts warned about the dearth of content announced for Stadia, which will launch this year, some in the video games press have breathlessly compared it to Sony’s launch of the first PlayStation in 1994. Amazon, Microsoft and China’s Tencent are all expected to reveal their own cloud gaming platforms, capitalising on their investments in data centres and connectivity around the world. 
The “death of the console” has been prematurely declared many times before. But after surviving the huge growth of mobile gaming, many in the industry believe this time it will come true now that expansive and graphically rich games can be streamed from the cloud to any device. 
“Probably what we all got wrong on the death of the console was the timing,” says Paul Murphy, a tech investor at Northzone Ventures and former chief of mobile gaming company Dots. “But I don’t think any of us got the idea wrong.”
Recommended
The tech industry loves to hype its latest big idea as the “next Uber” or “next Google” but in this case, the Netflix-for-gaming label fits the future of the games industry in several ways. 
Many players will take advantage of a similar kind of streaming technology that gives audiences instant access to a vast library of content. Today, gamers can sometimes wait hours to download a new title to their PC or console. Google has promised Stadia users will be able to launch a new game within just five seconds of clicking a link, delivered through its own internet infrastructure. 
Second, many of the tech industry’s platform companies dream of building the kind of huge and loyal subscriber base that has made Netflix a global media company on a scale never before seen. As iPhone sales have slowed, subscriptions have become a particular priority for Apple, which is said to be courting games creators for a new service that would sit alongside its renewed push into video and news. 
All the many companies engaged in a ‘Battle Royale’ for gamers’ attention want to be the first destination their audience turns to for a form of entertainment that is already far more lucrative than movies or music. “The future of gaming is a fight for a direct relationship with the end user,” says Nicholas Lovell, game director at Brighton-based studio Electric Square and author of The Curve, a book about digital distribution. 
Only relatively recently has Silicon Valley realised just how important that relationship might be. Apple and Google came to dominate distribution of mobile games through their app stores for iPhones and Android devices almost by accident, as video games quickly became the most popular and lucrative form of mobile apps. 
“This is a very different market to what it was five years ago and 10 years ago,” says Alexis Bonte, a venture partner at tech investor Atomico and chief executive of games studio eRepublik Labs. “It’s much bigger. We are talking about a $140bn market, which means that it attracts the attention of new players in different ways.” 
The success of titles such as Fortnite, which first launched on mobile devices a year ago, forced the tech platforms to recognise just how much bigger the gaming demographic has become in the smartphone era. 
“People are not going to be calling themselves ‘gamers’ any more. You don’t call yourself a ‘TV watcher’,” says Roberta Lucca, co-founder of UK-based game developer and publisher Bossa Studios. “Games are just so pervasive.”
Gaming used to be written off as something for kids and nerds, but the generation born in the 1980s never grew out of them — and is now raising their own children on the principle that gaming sits as an equal alongside books, music and movies. 
“I would go as far as to say [gaming] is the single most important thing happening right now in our culture,” says Herman Narula, chief executive of Improbable, a London-based start-up which makes simulation technology to create “virtual worlds” both in games and other applications. “It’s going to change the way we make money and relate to each other and form our most important relationships.” 
That is one of the reasons why Apple has spent several months offering generous multimillion-dollar advances to developers to secure exclusive content for a planned games subscription service that could launch this year, according to several people with knowledge of the deals. (Apple declined to comment.)
Google’s Stadia launch is in part a recognition of how important videos of people playing games are to YouTube, which will be tightly integrated into the cloud service, and the risk of losing that audience to Amazon’s rival video platform, Twitch, which it bought in 2014.

		 it announced only a couple of titles that would be available when Stadia launches. Like movies and music, gaming remains a hit-driven business. Many people play only the most popular games where they can find their friends for online battles, such as Fortnite or EA’s fast-growing rival, Apex Legends. Free-to-play titles like these create winner-takes-all dynamics for their creators. 
But guessing which content will be the next Fortnite will become ever more complicated as the very concept of a game begins to morph. 
At a first glance, Fortnite might look like just another online shoot-’em-up, as 100 players battle across an island until only one winner survives. But traditional shooting games such as Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty series — a franchise whose lifetime sales have surpassed $17bn — do not tend to put on in-game dance parties. 
When Fortnite did just that, hosting superstar DJ Marshmello in concert last month, some 10.7m people joined the game to attend, with many more watching on Twitch and YouTube. 
As well as creating a place for friends to hang out (when they aren’t trying to kill each other virtually), Fortnite has also established in gamers’ minds the principle that they can play the same game on any device — be that console, PC, smartphone or tablet — against the same group of friends. 
For many years, Sony has recognised the potentially huge financial rewards of building a huge in-house studio, which created two of 2018’s biggest hits, Spider-Man and God of War. 
Microsoft’s efforts to emulate that has seen a flurry of deals in which it has bought a string of midsized studios around the world. Of the 17 acquisitions Microsoft made in 2018, seven were games-related in a bid to augment its Xbox console offering. 
Astris Advisory analyst David Gibson says the possibility of a multibillion-dollar games studio acquisition has grown. “We could be looking at a situation where you have a number of big competing streaming services with deep pockets all saying that they need content and looking to buy studios,” he says. 
That is just one reason why the arrival of big tech groups makes companies such as Nintendo and the wider games industry nervous as well as excited. 
“What we are seeing with the evolution of this technology is gaming is getting more and more fragmented,” says Andy Kleinman, founder of Wonder, a start-up developing a gaming platform that works across different devices. While lucrative for developers, that is “worse for the user” because they will need too many apps, logins and subscriptions, he says. “Companies who are focused on building games should build games and companies focused on building platforms should build platforms.”
Just as the arrival of Netflix, Apple and Amazon has driven up the price of Hollywood’s top talent, in the near term games developers are likely to see a windfall as tech companies vie for content. But developers should remember that after buying up Hollywood’s archives, Netflix turned itself into the studios’ biggest competitor, warns Mr Lovell, the author and game director. 
“Content makers love the idea of a ‘Netflix for games’ and a new way of getting paid,” he says. “I worry a lot of them are not realising the deal with the devil they are doing.”

Most of the company’s subscriber growth now comes from international markets while non-English language series produced by Netflix, such as Protector, from Turkey, and Casa de Flores, from Mexico, have proven popular outside the countries where they were made.
The company is ramping up the number of series, documentaries and movies it produces across Europe in 2019 and is on course to make 221 new projects this year, including 153 originals.
“We have an amazing opportunity to bring stories from different cultures and in different languages to audiences all around the world, said Ms Bajaria. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said she would “bring the world’s stories to the world whatever the language.”
Ms Bajaria replaces Erik Barmack, who is leaving to start his own production company. She joined Netflix in October 2016 and has led scripted and unscripted programming of series such as You, Bodyguard, and Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.
Before coming to Netflix she was president of Universal Television where she made hit series such as Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Master of None.

https://www.ft.com/content/93dc4694-2892-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,Matthew Rocco,"Apple should buy Netflix, Sonos or Activision Blizzard, JPMorgan says",2019-02-04,18:38:33,"If Apple’s $245bn cash pile is burning a hole in its pocket, it could do worse than buy Netflix, according to analysts at JPMorgan.
The investment bank speculated that Netflix, video-game developer Activision Blizzard and speaker maker Sonos are the best strategic fits should Apple seek large acquisitions to drive growth, particularly in its services business.
“While investors hardly seem to be complaining about the massive buyback pace, including ~$73bn last year, we believe they do hope the firm uses its balance sheet strength to insulate the business against often-seen disruptions in the technology landscape, some of which Apple itself has driven in the past,” JPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note to clients on Monday.
Apple shocked Wall Street last month when it unveiled a rare downgrade to its guidance, saying revenue would fall short of its expectations as sales in China weakened and customers wait longer to upgrade their iPhones. Last week, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant reported $84.3bn in revenue for the quarter ending in December, down 5 per cent year-over-year. Sales in the current quarter are forecast to drop as much as 10 per cent.
With many technology names trading below 52-week highs, Mr Chatterjee called it an “opportune time” for Apple to use its strong balance sheet to refocus on growth potential in services, a segment that includes Apple Music and the App Store, and whose sales jumped 19 per cent in the most recent quarter.
Netflix represents the best strategic fit for Apple in the video content space, although a tie-up with the popular streaming service would be expensive, he said. Mr Chatterjee believes Netflix would command a “much higher premium” than 20 per cent, which would give the company an enterprise value of $189bn. Netflix had a market value of $148bn as of Friday’s close, in addition to $7bn in net debt.
But scooping up Netflix would accelerate Apple’s plans to create original video content, according to JPMorgan.
“Video streaming, including original video content, is a highly competitive market with established traditional media houses as well new entrants fighting aggressively for incremental subscribers, which is likely to make it difficult to scale any new platform to compete effectively,” Mr Chatterjee said, noting that Netflix had 139m global paid subscribers by the end of 2018.
He added: “With media/video consumption expected to increasingly move to mobile devices, Apple could fortify its ecosystem with the acquisition of one of the largest on-demand content providers.”
In video gaming, JPMorgan suggested Activision Blizzard would be a strategic fit given the market’s shift towards mobile gaming. A hypothetical Sonos acquisition would help enhance the value of Apple Music and bolster the company’s smart home products, the note said.
Spokespeople for Sonos and Activision Blizzard declined to comment. Apple and Netflix didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shares in Apple were trading 2.6 per cent higher at $170.83 on Monday afternoon. Netflix rallied 2.7 per cent, while Sonos surged 7 per cent. Activision Blizzard shares rose 1.5 per cent.
Electronic Arts, which JPMorgan said was a less ideal merger partner than Activision Blizzard, was one of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100. Shares were down 2.7 per cent.

Netflix has been pouring billions of dollars into original content, out-bidding traditional studios for the most sought-after talent, including acclaimed director Alfonso Cuarón. The company threw its weight behind Mr Cuarón’s film Roma, a critically acclaimed black-and-white drama that chronicles the life of a maid and her family in Mexico City. 
The streaming giant has ruffled feathers in the film industry because it prefers to release its growing slate of movies on its streaming platform at the same time as they are released in cinemas. The company made a compromise on this front for Roma, as it seeks to expand its presence in film under the lead of producer Scott Stuber, who joined Netflix two years ago.
Roma was promoted at prestigious film festivals and released in a small number of cinemas nearly a month before it was available to stream on Netflix. While it takes only a few screenings to qualify a film for entry to the Oscars, the Motion Picture Academy’s voters are believed to look more favourably on movies that have a wider release. 
Roma was nominated for 10 awards, including Netflix’s first ever best picture nomination, and is tied with The Favourite for the most nominations this year. It won five additional nominations: three for The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a cowboy comedy by the Coen brothers, and two in the documentary shorts category.
Keeping filmmakers happy is important for Netflix, to ensure that it can keep attracting talent and content. As Netflix is secretive about the viewing figures for anything shown on its service, awards can be a vital badge of success for creators.
Netflix last week reported that it had its best year ever in terms of subscribers, adding nearly 29m new customers globally. However, investors were unimpressed by its net income, which shrunk to $134m for the fourth quarter, a 27 per cent drop from a year prior. 
Netflix uses debt to help fund its heavy spending on the production and acquisition of films and TV series. The company’s long-term debt stood at $10.4bn as of the end of December, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. Netflix last week said it anticipated free cash outflows of $3bn in 2019.
Netflix’s foray into film comes as the industry is undergoing immense change, with Disney swallowing up Fox’s entertainment assets, shrinking the number of major studios from six to five. However, last year was also a positive one for the cinema industry: US box-office sales rose 7 per cent to $11.9bn in 2018, according to ComScore.
Among other streaming services, Amazon, which previously achieved an Oscar milestone in 2017 as the first streaming service to land a best picture nomination with Manchester By the Sea, received just three nominations for Oscars this year. 
Recommended
Nevertheless, traditional studios still dominated the Academy’s list of nominees. The Favourite, a Yorgos Lanthimos-directed period comedy starring Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, also achieved 10 nominations, including one for best picture. The Favourite was distributed by Fox Searchlight, which will be under the helm of Disney after the companies integrate. 
Other standouts include A Star is Born, the latest remake of the Hollywood favourite, starring Lady Gaga, which scored eight nominations, including a best actress nod for the pop star. The film was distributed through Warner Bros studio, now owned by AT&T through its acquisition of Time Warner. 
Black Panther, Disney’s Marvel blockbuster, was nominated for seven awards, including best picture. It is the first superhero movie to be recognised in that category.

Despite an underwhelming reaction from investors to its latest quarterly results, the streaming giant’s stock is up nearly 30 per cent so far this month, continuing its powerful recovery from the December sell-off’s nadir.
That helps keep Netflix on course for one of its best starts to the year on record. But in contrast to other big Januaries, the share price gains have been front-loaded, as a broad market rebound lifts other stocks and indices from their recent lows.
Netflix released a strong slate of holiday programming during the December quarter. That included Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller that prompted many viewers to mimic the main characters and attempt day-to-day tasks blindfolded, sometimes with predictably harmful results. Still, results showed new subscriber additions and revenue fell short of market forecasts, with investors marking the shares down 2.3 per cent on Friday to $345.35.
Among the so-called Faang stocks, Netflix has had the most powerful recovery since the lows that most of the quintet struck on December 24. It is up nearly 50 per cent over that period, but had also suffered the biggest drop among the group from its record high last year, falling 44.2 per cent to $233.88 on Christmas Eve from $418.97 on July 9.
Netflix is down 17.2 per cent from its record high, lagging Alphabet and Amazon on this measure.
Up 29.2 per cent so far this month, the stock’s performance this January still lags that of even last year, when it rose 40.8 per cent, and has plenty of work to do to take out 2013’s 78.5 per cent leap.

The Austrian privacy campaign group None of Your Business asked the country’s data regulator to investigate the firms for violating GDPR, the data regulation that came into force last May. 
The group said the companies failed to provide basic information, such as how they buy and sell user data, when contacted by 10 private citizens with requests for their personal information. 
“When tested, none of these systems provided the user with all relevant data. In most cases, users only got the raw data, but, for example, no information about who this data were shared with. This leads to structural violations of users’ rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information,” said Max Schrems, co-founder and director of NOYB, who has already beaten Facebook in a major privacy case and filed complaints against the company across Europe.
GDPR grants users the right to be informed about where and how their data are transacted, and how long it is stored for. This “right to access” is enshrined in Article 15, with violations theoretically leading to fines of up to €20m or 4 per cent of the companies’ worldwide turnover. 
To investigate whether large firms were indeed complying with GDPR, the group worked with 10 volunteers in Vienna who requested their own data from eight companies — Netflix, YouTube, Apple, Amazon, Spotify, SoundCloud, Flimmit and DAZN. “The results confirmed they were all evading their obligation to provide data or providing insufficient or inaccurate responses,” said Ioannis Kouvakas, a NOYB data protection lawyer who drafted the complaints. 
Recommended
Of the eight services that were queried, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Amazon had automated systems that allowed users to download their data immediately. 
Apple provided users roughly “40 Excel spreadsheets filled with alphanumeric data that made absolutely no sense,” said Mr Kouvakas. “More than 80 per cent of the data from Apple was in an incomprehensible form.” 
Similarly Google-owned YouTube also provided files that were mostly gibberish to the average person, including in esoteric file formats like JSON, he said. 
Netflix provided a list of raw data including descriptions of all series watched, details of when and where they were watched and which devices they were watched on. 
But they did not disclose what third parties they shared or procured data from. Mr Kouvakas added the company had also retained certain data such as a user’s IP address, a proxy for their exact location, for more than five years. “They have to delete the data as long as they’re no longer necessary for processing, and they have to provide justification for retaining each data type,” Mr Kouvakas said. “They did not.”
Tech groups have been preparing for a rush of similar claims under GDPR. In November, Privacy International, a campaign group, filed a series of complaints to the British, Irish and French data regulators against data brokers and advertising technology companies asking why they gather certain information and share it with third parties.
The case for users’ right to their own data has been fought publicly by Apple chief executive Tim Cook, who wrote in an essay this week: “[W]e believe the Federal Trade Commission should establish a data-broker clearinghouse, requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and giving users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all.”
Recommended
Mr Kouvakas said this was ironic. “Making declarations about how you respect user privacy is important but in order for it not to be a marketing statement, it has to be borne out in practice,” he said. “If the data they provide is incomprehensible to users, it doesn’t allow users to exercise their rights properly.”
A YouTube spokesperson said: “YouTube and Google provide industry leading tools to give users meaningful data transparency and control.” They added that they inform users of retention practices/time periods in Google’s privacy policy. 
“Privacy and data protection are core to Netflix, and we comply with the GDPR. We have not yet formally received the complaint,” Netflix said.
“Spotify takes data privacy and our obligations to users extremely seriously. We are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant,” a spokesperson said.
Apple and Amazon declined to comment. The Austrian Data regulator did not respond to a request for comment.

The figures sent the company’s shares down as much as 3.8 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday.
Netflix said it added 8.8m net new subscribers in the quarter, helped mainly by growth in countries outside the US. This was better than the 7.6m Netflix executives had forecast three months ago, and a Factset poll of analysts, but just below a Bloomberg poll looking for 9.2m.
Fourth-quarter revenue jumped to $4.19bn, up 27 per cent from a year ago, but also under analyst expectations of $4.21bn. For the year, sales rose 35 per cent to $16bn.
The results came two days after Netflix raised prices for all US customers, a move that was cheered by investors and industry analysts, sending the shares higher earlier in the week.
“The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said eMarketer media analyst Paul Verna.
For the final three months of the year countries outside the US continued to drive growth for Netflix, adding 7.3m net new paid accounts in the quarter compared to only 1.5m in the US.
George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Don’t be fooled by the muted share price reaction to Netflix’s numbers . . . the numbers are well ahead of the group’s guidance from [October earnings]”.
Investors and analysts keep a close eye on Netflix’s ability to attract new subscribers as it pours billions of dollars into new films and television shows, regularly outbidding traditional Hollywood studios and TV networks for the most sought-after scripts and ideas.
As costs for programming have ballooned, Netflix executives have justified it as investment that leads to subscriber growth, against competition from Disney, Amazon and others. The latest results still validated that strategy last year: Netflix added nearly 29m subscribers globally, making 2018 its best year for customer growth. 
Netflix said it expected to add another 8.9m subscribers in the current quarter.
Netflix has been spending big to finance the production and acquisition of films and TV series, and analysts had expected the splurge to dent profits but the hit was not as steep as Wall Street anticipated. 
Net income for the quarter fell to $134m, or 30 cents a share, from $186m, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Wall Street analysts were expecting 24 cents a share. 
Operating margins narrowed to 5.2 per cent from 7.5 per cent a year ago — just ahead of the 5 per cent analysts had forecast.
Recommended
Netflix uses debt to help finance its heavy spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $10.4bn as of the end of December up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. Netflix on Thursday said it anticipated free cash outflows in 2019 to be about the same as 2018, which totalled $3bn.
During the quarter Netflix released a strong slate of holiday programming, notably Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller which the company estimates will be watched by more than 80m subscriber households in its first four weeks on the service.
Netflix, which has until recently been secretive about viewership numbers, also touted the popularity of other programmes released in the quarter. 
You, a drama series starring Penn Badgley, was viewed by a projected 40m subscriber households in its first month on Netflix, the company said.
In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it is up against a “very broad set of competitors” that extends beyond traditional television to gaming. “We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO,” the company said.

Customers in the US, its largest market, and some Latin American countries will pay $8.99 a month for the cheapest Netflix streaming plan, up from $7.99. For its most popular tier, which offers high-definition video, prices will rise by $2 a month to $12.99. A “premium” plan will cost $15.99, up from $13.99. 
The price rises take effect immediately for new customers and will be introduced “over the next few months” for existing users, according to people familiar with the plans.
Investors and analysts cheered the move, sending Netflix shares up more than 5 per cent in morning New York trading. The stock has climbed by more than 30 per cent so far this year. 
“We believe this action has a high probability of success, further fuelling the Netflix flywheel,” said Mark Mahaney from RBC.
The price rise is meant to reflect Netflix’s heavy investments in content, according to people familiar with the company’s strategy. Netflix has been pouring money into original films and television series — analysts estimate the company spent $13bn on original programming in 2018. It released dozens of films last year, ranging from romantic comedy hits like To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, to Oscars contender Roma. 
Recommended
In a statement, Netflix said: “We change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience for the benefit of our members.”
At $12.99 a month, a standard Netflix plan is now a dollar more than rival Hulu’s ad-free subscription but cheaper than HBO Now, which costs $14.99 a month. 
Netflix had 137m subscribers globally as of September, of which 58m are in the US. Analysts expect the company to say that it added another 9m subscribers up until the end of December when it reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.
It is the fourth time Netflix has raised US prices, most recently in 2017. However, this is the first time it will affect all US customers, and also the first price rise for its cheapest plan.
Netflix is racing to build up its library as it faces looming competition in the streaming video market it pioneered. Disney, AT&T and Apple are expected to unveil new streaming rivals in the next year.
The company uses debt to finance its spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017, and Netflix issued another $2bn in bonds in October. 
Netflix has also signed contracts to license and produce future programmes, sometimes years in advance of broadcasting the shows. When adding these commitments to debt, Netflix had just over $28bn of total contractual obligations at the end of 2017, including more than $17bn owed for programming over the next five years, according to a regulatory filing. 
While fast subscriber growth has helped ease concerns, some analysts remain wary over the group’s cash burn rate. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that.

It became the streaming equivalent of a blockbuster. Netflix claims 45m accounts watched Bird Box globally in the first week of its release, while television ratings group Nielsen says 26m people in the US viewed it in that time.
The film’s popularity was helped by social media, where it became a viral meme, spawning a #BirdBoxChallenge as people posted videos of themselves blindfolded in various settings. “Classical measurement has either been box office or awards. This defies all of it,” director Susan Bier told the Hollywood Reporter. “But creating a phenomenon is bound to translate into something.” 
On Thursday, Netflix will update investors on how programming such as Bird Box translates into income. Netflix’s business model is expensive — the company spent an estimated $13bn on content in 2018, regularly outbidding traditional Hollywood studios and TV networks for the most sought-after scripts and ideas. 
As costs have ballooned, Netflix executives have justified it as investment that leads to subscriber and revenue growth. Thursday’s fourth-quarter results are expected to confirm that thesis: analysts predict Netflix added another 9.2m subscribers in the period, which would make 2018 the company’s best-ever year for subscription growth. 
The hype surrounding Bird Box and other holiday programming has helped sentiment for Netflix in recent weeks, as did a strong showing at the Golden Globes, where Netflix won five awards, more than any individual network or studio. The shares are up by more than 40 per cent since Christmas Eve. 
Wall Street analysts are on board. Goldman Sachs predicted that the fourth quarter “will only be the beginning of the pay-off from Netflix's accelerating spend and increasingly robust originals slate”, adding that “consensus continues to significantly underestimate the financial impacts of these dynamics”. UBS said Netflix would “achieve a higher margin and free

Analysts expect Netflix’s revenue to have grown to $4.21bn for the three months ending in December, up 28 per cent from a year ago. However, Netflix has been spending big to finance the production and acquisition of films and TV series, and analysts expect the splurge to hit profits. Net income is forecast to decline to 24 cents a share in the quarter, from 41 cents a year ago,while the consensus is for operating margins to fall to 5 per cent, from 7.5 per cent a year ago. 
Shares in Netflix soared in the first half of last year, briefly making it the world’s most valuable media company. However, the rally — which has earned it a place alongside Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, the so-called “Faang” stocks — faltered after a surprising second-quarter miss on subscribers. 
The company recovered in the third quarter by adding almost 7m new customers, but investors and analysts will be looking for further reassurance of the company’s ability to attract and keep the attention of subscribers.
Netflix uses debt to finance its spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. It spent $291.6m on interest payments for the first nine months of 2018, compared with $238m for the whole of 2017. 
The company forecasts a free cash burn of $3bn for 2018 and another $3bn in 2019, but expects an improvement after that. 
Recommended
But the pressure on Netflix to keep growing its multibillion-dollar content budget is only increasing as more and more rivals emerge in the video streaming market, with Disney, Apple and AT&T expected to launch fresh offerings. 
“This reminds me of Hollywood in the 1920s and 1930s, when studios were hiring so many people to roll out content as quickly as possible, because there was so much appetite for it,” said Jeff Bock, an analyst at Exhibitor Relations. “You just wanted content, it didn’t matter what it was. That’s what it feels like Netflix is doing now.”

The move by Saudi-controlled MBC Group, which is based in Dubai, is part of Riyadh’s efforts to wage fierce propaganda wars against rivals Iran and Qatar.
Media assets, ranging from satellite news to football rights, have become soft power weapons for governments including the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally, as the region has been reordered since the Arab uprisings of 2011.
MBC is to hire former Hulu executive Johannes Larcher to broaden its digital and video on demand service, named Shahid, with plans to develop new Arabic content, the people said.
MBC’s newly launched production house, MBC Studios, is already working on new films and shows to feed the video service, the people added, including historical biopics of Arab leaders and a dramatisation of the folk tales of 1,001 Nights. MBC also plans to buy content from the rest of the world.
The potential challenge to Netflix’s regional dominance comes as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman grapples with the fallout from the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for which he has been blamed.
At the request of the Saudi government, Netflix recently pulled an episode of comedy series Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj, which was critical of Prince Mohammed in the aftermath of the Khashoggi affair, renewing concerns over freedom of expression.
The government has put 11 Saudis on trial for Khashoggi’s killing and denied that Prince Mohammed was involved.
MBC, which reaches 140m satellite and online viewers in the region, came under majority government ownership last year in the wake of the crown prince’s purported anti-corruption shakedown in November 2017. One of the hundreds of princes and magnates detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel was MBC chairman Waleed al-Ibrahim, who retained his 40 per cent stake in the company and nominal management control, but the remaining shareholdings were transferred to a subsidiary of the finance ministry.
MBC, which was founded in 1991, has traditionally operated at arm’s length from government control, showing more liberal programming than Saudi state television, albeit within the boundaries of “family-friendly” content.
“Prevailing in-house standards that apply to on-screen TV will be applied to Shahid originals,” said one of the people.
Saudi Arabia has sought to use its financial muscle in the Arab media to shape political debate in the tumultuous region, where Riyadh and its ally Abu Dhabi have lined up against Iran and imposed a trade embargo on Qatar for backing political Islam, most volubly through its Al Jazeera network.
Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a publisher controlled by the family of King Salman, the Saudi monarch, has agreed to launch a news channel with Bloomberg, known as Bloomberg Asharq, though speculation has grown about its future since Khashoggi’s killing.
Nabeel al-Khatib, project director for Bloomberg Asharq, was last week named general manager at a sister station of MBC, the government-owned news channel Al Arabiya. He replaced Turki al-Dakhil, an adviser to Prince Mohammed, in a senior management shake-up at the network.
Recommended
MBC is hoping that its pre-eminence in Arabic TV entertainment will help it to catch up with Netflix and fend off other on-demand streaming services, such as Starz Play, Wavo and Amazon.
Last year, the Shahid video service had 72m users, including 600,000 subscribers to its premium service.
Netflix has grown rapidly in the Middle East, with the largest paying subscriber base of 1.7m across the Arab world, according to Simon Murray, principal analyst at Digital TV Research, a UK-based consultancy.
“There is already a lot of competition in the Arab world, but Netflix stands apart — largely for its international appeal and original content,” said Mr Murray.
Saudi investors have also established a London-based Farsi language news network, Iran International, to serve Iranian viewers.
Iranian officials suspect that the channel is backed by the Saudi government and is a tool in the growing regional media war. A spokesman for Iran International denied any state funding.

Shares in the streaming company jumped 5.6 per cent to $314.16, putting them up nearly 18 per cent year-to-date. This follows a more than 10 per cent surge on Friday when analysts at Goldman Sachs gave the stock a thumbs up, awarding it the highest price target on Wall Street.
Netflix won four awards for original content on Sunday. Roma, the Mexican film, snagged best director for Alfonso Cuarón and also won best motion picture in a foreign language. Meanwhile, The Kominsky Method won two Golden Globes, one for best television series, musical or comedy and one for Michael Douglas for best performance by an actor in a television series, musical. And the British sitcom Bodyguard, picked up by Netflix, also won an award for actor Richard Madden. 
By comparison Jeff Bezos’s Amazon picked up just two awards for actors in its original series The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and A Very English Scandal.
The wins were seen as an endorsement of Netflix’s heavy push into original content as it seeks to stave off competition from Amazon and media heavyweights like Walt Disney and AT&T that are looking to launch subscription services this year.
Alongside the accolades, the company also received some upbeat commentary on Wall Street, where Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said their analysis of Netflix search trends point to “upside potential” for US subscriber growth in the December quarter. 
“Specifically, consensus calls for 10.0% y/y domestic sub growth in Q4 (an 80 bps decline in y/y growth vs. Q3) and our search index points to 11.5% growth (50 bps acceleration in y/y growth vs. Q3)” he said. Netflix is expected to report fourth-quarter results on January 17.
Sunday’s wins and Mr Olson’s comments added to upbeat sentiment on the stock this year after analysts at Goldman Sachs on Friday awarded the company a $400 price target. They argued the Netflix’s “investment in content, technology and distribution will continue to drive subscriber growth well above consensus expectations both in the US and internationally”. 
The analysts also argued that while these investments and Netflix’s about $3bn cash burn will need it to return to the high yield debt market over the next three years, they do see a way for the company to “both double its annual content investment and generate positive cash return by 2022”.
Despite the recent success Netflix also received mixed reviews of its first interactive programme for adults: an episode of Black Mirror titled Bandersnatch. And one of the challenges facing new finance chief Spencer Neumann is how much debt the company should shoulder to support original content. 
Netflix’s 2019 rally follows a 39 per cent increase in its shares last year.

The second episode of Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj focused on Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and included criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.
“Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that as a Muslim, and as an American,” Mr Minhaj said at the start of the episode. He called the Yemen war “the biggest tragedy of the MBS era”, referring to the crown prince by his initials.
Netflix confirmed that it had removed the episode in Saudi Arabia last week, after the country’s Communications and Information Technology Commission made a request to take it down because it allegedly violated the kingdom’s anti-cyber crime law.
Saudi Arabia has become an influential player in the technology and entertainment sectors through big investments by its sovereign wealth fund, which directly owns stakes in companies such as Uber and many other groups indirectly through its backing of Japan’s SoftBank Vision Fund.
Later in the removed episode, Mr Minhaj criticised Silicon Valley for “swimming in Saudi cash” and urged tech companies to stop taking investment from the kingdom.
The Saudi law has been previously criticised by human rights groups as a tool to suppress free speech and has been used to convict activists using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to criticise the government in recent years.
The CITC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Netflix defended its decision. “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request — and to comply with local law,” the company said.
Netflix said the Saudi telecoms regulator cited Article 6 of the law as reason for the request. The article states that “production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers” is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine not exceeding SR3m ($800,000).
While the episode has been removed from Netflix, Saudi users can still watch it on the show’s official channel on YouTube.
Activists and rights groups warn that some governments may abuse their legal procedures in order to deprive their citizens of basic freedoms and say companies should take a more nuanced approach when it comes to addressing official takedown requests from undemocratic states.
“Banning a comedy act that brings valid criticism of a government is a counterproductive measure and an affront to the freedom of expression that all citizens deserve,” said Jillian C York, a director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
The incident comes as online platforms and the technology companies behind them face increasing scrutiny over their public policy and relationship with governments.
Saudi Arabia, where roughly two-thirds of the population are under 30, represents a rapidly growing market for tech companies, which can make them cautious about upsetting the authorities for fear of losing access to affluent consumers.
Twitter quietly fired a Saudi engineer in 2015 after western intelligence officials told the company that the government had persuaded him to spy on the accounts of dissidents, according to the New York Times. The company also warned of “unusual activity” from Saudi Arabia and China last November after discovering a bug that could have revealed the country code of users’ phone numbers.
Experts say companies should be transparent about removing or restricting content, with a clear policy of conducting due diligence on government requests that follow legal procedures.
“If they are not doing all these things then they are not following established industry best practice for being accountable and responsible in handling government demands to restrict content,” said Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation.
Netflix said its policy of complying with local law was consistent with how other US-based companies operated, but it did not disclose information about how many government requests it received or how many were acted upon in each jurisdiction.

On Friday, the streaming service is releasing its first interactive programme for adults, an episode of Black Mirror, the dystopian series created by Charlie Brooker about the often dark interactions between people and technology.
As the episode, titled “Bandersnatch”, unfolds, viewers are given a series of binary choices on what the main character, a programmer working on a choose-your-own-adventure computer game, should do, creating a branching set of storylines that descend down rabbit holes exploring free will and mind control.
“This particular idea is about the form that you’re experiencing it in. That’s why we were excited to do it,” Mr Brooker said.
Updating the choose-your-own-adventure format for the streaming video age is an expensive bet for Netflix at a time when it is already spending billions of dollars as competition for viewers escalates.
Netflix has a formidable head start: it counts 140m global subscribers and adds 80,000 new ones each day. But with media heavyweights Walt Disney and AT&T aiming to launch subscription services next year and television content owners growing more wary of giving up lucrative streaming rights to a company they see as a competitor, Netflix is doubling down on investments in original productions.
“Our job is to think about, what else can internet TV do that linear TV can’t?” said Carla Engelbrecht, Netflix’s director of product innovation, who oversees interactive content at the company.
Part of that push will bring more interactives based on the technology Netflix developed for “Bandersnatch”. The company hopes the format will prove a competitive advantage when convincing television watchers faced with an array of subscription choices that Netflix is a must-have.
“When this comes out we are going to get a lot of knocks on our door from creative people from around the world,” said Todd Yellin, Netflix vice-president of product. “We do picture you’re going to see a ramp up and more and more of this. But we don’t just do it for the sake of this; we do it if the story is right and interactivity will add to the experience.”
Netflix has been experimenting with interactive children’s programming for more than a year. It has released four children’s show episodes that let viewers pick the course of actions for characters, allowing them to play out different storylines and endings.
“If it didn’t work with kids we were going to walk away from this,” Mr Yellin said. “Kids were eating it up and then we started to test with adults and it looked really good.”
Netflix is not the only company testing the waters of interactive video. HQ Trivia, a live quiz show app, shot to popularity a year ago, drawing in 1m viewers a day and raising $15m in funding* earlier, demonstrating appetite for interactive entertainment at scale. But the company has been thrown into turmoil following the death of its chief executive this month.
HBO released an app to accompany Mosaic, a series from film-maker Steven Soderbergh, that allowed viewers to follow the story through different characters’ perspectives.
Twitch, the video game live streaming site owned by Amazon, has also expressed interest in creating choose-your-own-adventure programmes.
The question for Netflix as it looks to build a catalogue of choose-your-own-adventure titles is whether the technology is truly the future of television or simply a stunt.
Mr Brooker admitted to harbouring doubts when Netflix executives first approach him and his co-creator Annabel Jones over creating an interactive episode of Black Mirror.
“We didn’t know what the story would be and we were like, ‘Wouldn’t that just be a gimmick?’” Mr Brooker said.
Recommended
But once the pair hit upon a plot with the right themes, they were quick to embrace the opportunity, Ms Jones said.
“It’s absolutely baked into the story this idea of freedom of choice and control and the illusion of control and the illusion of choice. Once you’ve got that as the basic conceit and you have the protagonist and you can give them multiple endings, but those endings only build to reinforce the whole, then that’s delicious,” she said.
The multiple narrative strands mean the episode contains more video than a traditional television programme. It has five main endings and multiple additional variations. Netflix claims that the choice points sprinkled through the episode mean there are more than a trillion unique permutations possible.
All of that demanded a greater amount of production time and expense. Netflix created proprietary software to map out the branches of the story and keep track of how choices made early on would affect what viewers are shown later.
“In terms of production timeline it was akin to producing two episodes,” Ms Engelbrecht said. Netflix declined to say how much production cost.
From a creative point of view, the effort was even greater, Mr Brooker said.
“We thought going in, it’s probably about as complicated as doing two episodes. And then that kept growing, because the thing kept exponentially growing,” he said. “So by the end . . . it felt like doing a whole season in one go.”

https://www.ft.com/content/13078a02-0465-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,Jo Ellison,Is Netflix’s global dominance a force for good or bad?,2018-12-28,05:00:25,"How have you been spending the holiday period? Regardless of faith or family, many of us will have lost an afternoon, evening, or possibly even 10 days straight sprawled in front of the television.
If you are one of the 130m people worldwide who subscribe to Netflix, there is a high possibility that this week you will have watched one of the following: The Christmas Chronicles, a family film starring Kurt Russell, which had 20m downloads within three weeks of its release; the Spanish-language film Roma, set in 1970s Mexico, directed by Alfonso Cuarón and already tipped to win an Oscar; Mowgli, a live-action adventure based around the Jungle Book novels; or Bird Box, an apocalyptic thriller starring Sandra Bullock.
Perhaps you haven’t yet seen any of them. In which case you should prob­ably hurry up and do so because you’ll need to have an opinion about one or preferably all by the time you return to your desk. Netflix is one subject that transcends geopolitical boundaries, national interests and generation gaps.
In the five years since it started streaming original content, we’ve become a bunch of binge-watching insatiables, desperate for entertainment and the hit of the “what’s next?”. Other channels exist, of course — Amazon Prime, HBO and the venerable BBC among them, all delivering their own acclaimed series. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, plans to launch a Disney streaming service next year. An AT&T streamer is also planned. But no other brand has come close to claiming Netflix’s reach.
“More shows, more watching; more watching, more subs; more subs, more revenue; more revenue, more content,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told New York Magazine this year, when asked to outline his model for growth. The phrase “Netflix and chill” first entered the lexicon in 2013. These days we’re just Netflixed.
And yet, for all the whoop-de-do, Netflix’s overwhelming dominance has made some wary. Over 2018, at least half a dozen fashion designers told me how they were inspired by the prestige drama The Crown in their own collections. Others have cited the saffron-robed cultists of the Wild Wild Country documentary as their muse. Could such a cultural hegemony be dulling our creative output?
Others, meanwhile, wonder whether the network can sustain its quality offering when it is now making so many programmes. And to what extent are these lauded shows merely window-dressing for a platform on which original content makes up only a fraction of its views? (According to TV analyst Ampere, original programmes constitute only 8 per cent of Netflix content watched when measured in hours.) Are we really watching foreign-language document­aries, or are we actually schlubbing out over old repeats of Friends?
“Have you seen the movie WALL-E?,” asks Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who takes an especially dystopian view of the future, which he likens to the Pixar drama about the last robot on Earth. “It’s not necessarily 1984, it’s not necessarily Brave New World. It’s actually almost worse than that because it’s so lame,” he says. “We destroy the planet because it becomes completely uninhabitable, and we move it into outer space where the spaceship — which is powered by AI — pacifies and infantilises all humans that live on it. And they float around as fat slobs, watching whatever personalised entertainment system that’s there, and that becomes what it is to be human.”
Few others are so pessimistic, but many are worried that the network is building a monopoly with plans to leave us with nothing to watch but commercial sap. “I’ve heard a lot of people in the industry say that Netflix is the Coca-Cola of the audiovisual industry,” says one television and film producer who prefers to remain anonymous, as is often the case when you’re speaking about the most powerful entertainment company around.
“There’s an argument that they come blundering in saying, ‘Here’s a shiny new model and we’ve got loads of money’, very much like Coke when they go into a country. And they build a shiny new factory, or they will give one particular factory loads and loads of money and put all of the competitors out of work. And then the moment they’ve monopolised the market, they slash all of their wages. There’s a fear that they’ll put the competition out of business, and then charge whatever price they like.”
The danger is that you get a lot of dross to fill up what they imagine the appetite of the public is. And it’s like having too much sugar
“I think that’s a slightly exaggerated view of what they’re doing,” he continues. “But undoubtedly they’ve inflated prices for established talent, so suddenly big-name writers, actors and directors can be paid very large fees to do TV shows. And the tendency has been to draw those people away from terrestrial channels. So there is a bit of a talent drain going on from the UK to America. And everybody feels compelled to compete. What’s interesting over the past year, say, in the UK, is that costs have probably risen between 15 and 20 per cent: and some of that is the Netflix effect. But it’s not just the Netflix effect; it’s also the Amazon effect; and other global players.”
“That’s absolute rubbish,” says Peter Morgan, writer and showrunner of The Crown. Morgan, who first met the Netflix team when it was “operating out of a portacabin in Beverly Hills”, was persuaded to go with them when making The Crown because it married a British drama about what might be thought quite “stuffy” subject matter with a newly disruptive production house that he found “inspiring and releasing”.
The series debuted in November 2016 to coincide with the international push that saw Netflix operating in 190 countries. Immediately, it was a critical and popular smash, and season three of The Crown is now in production.
“They have an uncomplicated mandate to entertain, and I think that that has led to charges of them being like a Walmart because they have so much of everything, and they don’t have a particular line or objective or goal in the way that FX does or HBO,” says Morgan. “But I just don’t understand this talk of talent drains. Talent will go wherever talent is given a home and it’s not about the money. I think we can all agree that whether it’s a little podcast or a blockbuster television show, spending money isn’t the secret to success.” (He insists that reports of The Crown’s £10m-an-episode budget are horribly exaggerated.)
Morgan is adamant that Netflix has been a force for cultural good. “I can understand if you are new into the job as a commissioner at, say, one of the terrestrial broadcasters, that it must be a bit harder to get premium-quality content,” he says. “But from the point of view of the filmmakers, I think it’s a lovely moment. There used to be a time where all you would hear about was the star system. And that’s no f***ing fun if you’re a writer or a filmmaker or a director and basically your entire existence is predicated upon some infant, narcissist deranged creature surrounded by sycophants saying yes or no to a piece that’s suitably flattering to them. I’m far happier being in this universe where writers and producers are starting to get more of an upper hand.”
Morgan believes that far from creating a monopoly, the competition has opened things up. “There’s never been more people in jobs, there’s never been more work being done. I think there’s a lot to be happy about. Netflix has stimulated a huge amount of competition. The BBC is making more drama. Channel 4 is making drama. Sky is making drama. I don’t know a writer that is out of work. You can’t get a soundstage. You can’t get a post-production house. It’s impossible to book actors, they’re all busy. Everybody seems to be in work.”
Other producers agree that Netflix has done much to stimulate the market, experimenting with new formats and genres that might once have been deemed too niche. It has broadened our taste in unexpected ways, whether it’s for Finnish crime dramas (Deadwind) or German sci-fi thrillers (Dark). Meanwhile, smaller independent films that may not have had much exposure on general release have been given a second, successful life. 
“It’s one of the few elements about being British we can still hold our heads up about,” says Morgan. “You think about the brand of being British, which is so corrupted and devalued right now that you hold your head in shame. And then you realise Britain’s reputation is being held up by its cultural exports.”
Morgan was lucky. He walked into a room with the right idea at the right time. And he has been handsomely remunerated for it. What is more surprising, perhaps, is the extent to which he and his team were given free rein by Netflix to do what they wanted. One imagines a bunch of Silicon Valley techies devising scenes by script-bot. But the truth was quite the opposite.
“Honestly, they did leave us alone,” says the series’ producer Andy Harries. “And I think we have rewarded them with really, really great work. But I have to say,” he adds, “I think we’re a very responsible team. So we were trusted, and delivered for them.”
Harries, co-founder and chief executive of the UK production company Left Bank Pictures, recently signed another deal with Netflix to produce a new bilingual drama White Lines, which is set in Ibiza and is a co-production with the Spanish production company owned by Alex Pina, the showrunner behind the global hit La casa de papel (Money Heist).
“There’s no question that their desire to grow as fast as they have means that they are commissioning tons and tons of stuff,” he says of Netflix’s expansion. And commissioning isn’t cheap: as of September 30 2018, Netflix reported $8.34bn in long-term debt.
Whether it can keep up its current hit rate is more of a challenge. “In a sense they’ve created a different world for people in the way that they look at things, and in the way they watch things,” says another producer who prefers to speak off-record. “So it has revolutionised viewing, and it has created some very good drama and documentary and movies. The problem is that the machine has to be fed and so you can’t keep feeding it with good stuff because — as in everything — there’s only so many good things. And so the danger is that you get a lot of dross to fill up what they imagine the appetite of the public is. And it’s like having too much sugar.”
Most producers suggest that algorithms are playing at least a part in Netflix’s content. “Data is very, very important,” says Harries pragmatically. “They’re a tech company, and tech companies are very, very research- and data-obsessed.” There’s a sense also that commissioners, across all platforms, are becoming more careful. The grip is getting tighter. And no wonder. Netflix can ill-afford another disaster such as Baz Luhrmann’s Bronx-set musical drama The Get Down, which went wildly over budget, premiered this summer to a lukewarm critical response and was then promptly cancelled.
But Netflix itself is quick to push back on the idea that it is becoming more data-driven. “There’s no way an algorithm could have predicted that a show steeped in 1980s nostalgia and starring four unknown kids, like Stranger Things, would have been a huge success,” says Netflix spokesman Jonathan Bennett. “And actually, we have very little data on our subscribers. When you sign up, you give your name and email, payment details, so we don’t even know what country you live in, or your gender. All we know is your viewing tastes.”
It’s these viewing tastes that help inform the “taste clusters” that feed the different recommendations on the Netflix dashboard. Today, for example, my dashboard is encouraging me to make good on a 99 per cent match with the new Netflix film Dumplin’, about a Texas teenager who enters herself into a local pageant, one of whose judges is her former beauty queen mother, played by Jennifer Aniston; and, somewhat mortifyingly, suggesting that I will enjoy the 2006 romantic comedy The Holiday (a 98 per cent match). “We might suggest content you might not normally have watched,” says Bennett. Or, indeed, content I will never, ever watch, and which got clustered via a reading of my daughter’s viewing tastes.
There’s no way an algorithm could have predicted that a show like “Stranger Things” would have been a huge success
“Viewing figures are not the only measure,” adds Bennett. “We also look at social media to see how much buzz a show is getting. And whether a new show is pulling new subscribers in. And yes, we do take risks, and we make mistakes. But I think a measure of our success should be the number of industry accolades our original shows are getting. Success isn’t measured in a time slot.”
Maybe not, but new shows today have less time to make a good impression than they once had. “They know within a month how many people have watched it, and if people are not watching beyond an hour or two, they just cancel the shows, they’re gone,” says one producer. “It’s pretty savage.” Another producer bemoans the issue with promotion. After all, if you’ve only got one portal to go to, and there are more and more shows, how do you stand out?
In the meantime, the numbers keep growing. Many in the industry assume that they’ll one day sell to Amazon or another big competitor such as Apple. For the time being, however, it’s clear that they’re way out front. And there’s no point in trying to stop them.
“I am optimistic,” says Harries. “But I’m conscious that all things change; I’ve been too long in this business not to have seen many ups and downs and challenges. Getting into the originals game is a very, very expensive business. But it’s a ride. I mean, there is no question that the opening-up of the streamers has completely changed the business. It’s been transformative. It blows all the cobwebs off the old sort of terrestrial channels. But it’s ever-changing, and you certainly can’t take it for granted. It’s a crazy business but it’s enormous fun. You’ve got to just strap yourself in and go for it.”
In the meantime, the rest of us will no doubt stay glued to our sofas.
Founded in 1997 by chief executive Reed Hastings and tech entrepreneur Marc Randolph, Netflix first began streaming in 2007 — but it wasn’t until 2013, with the premiere of its first original drama House of Cards, that it emerged as a content creator in its own right.
Today it has around 130m paying subscribers, 73m of whom live outside the US (9m in the UK), and a subscription growth that some analysts predict will hit 300m by 2028. It accounts for 15 per cent of all internet bandwidth worldwide and the company recently surpassed Disney to become, at $153.8bn, the most valued media company in the world.
And the output is growing and growing and growing. Next year, Netflix is expected to spend up to $13bn on content, of which the majority will be spent on original programming. It’s also making a more strategic effort to build its global profile. In 2018, Netflix had 141 projects in Europe, 40 of which were based in the UK, and the channel is planning to launch 100 foreign-language originals within the next two years. Many will be developed at the massive new production site that the company is building in Madrid.

https://www.ft.com/content/2e2e1162-fcd0-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521,Anna Nicolaou,‘Friends’ episode shows the power of Netflix,2018-12-13,04:00:56,"Last week, Netflix gave devotees of Friends a scare. For a couple of days, it seemed that the sitcom would be taken down from the streaming service come January — a prospect that dismayed fans. 
Randall Stephenson, chief executive of AT&T, which now owns the rights to Friends via its purchase of Time Warner, assured investors last Tuesday that the show would stay on Netflix for another year. Netflix is paying close to $100m, equivalent to about $400,000 per episode for a show that last aired live 14 years ago. 
It is the first of dozens of such decisions that traditional media companies will have to make in the coming months. Walt Disney and AT&T have between them spent more than $150bn on megadeals to build up their arsenals of content, and are working to launch their own streaming services next year. 
Most industry executives and analysts accept that the days of people paying $100 a month for hundreds of TV channels are numbered. AT&T lost another 300,000 TV customers this in its most recent quarter, while Comcast lost 106,000. Netflix, meanwhile, is on track for its best year yet, adding 80,000 subscribers a day. However, Disney makes $6bn at the box office and still generates half of its operating income from television channels. 
Media companies must choose what content to restrict to their own streaming services, and what to keep available on other platforms where hundreds of millions of people might watch it. This will not only determine how valuable their streaming services might be — it will also directly impact revenues. MoffettNathanson analysts predict Disney’s streaming push will slice revenues for its film studio and media networks units by $1.4bn in fiscal 2020. 
“This is going to be a food fight for a while,” Liberty Media chief John Malone told CNBC last month. “The question is how much pain are they willing to suffer pulling back rights for existing distribution, so that they create this appetite or starvation, for their brand and their content?” 
“This is a looming disaster,” said Jonathan Taplin, an Oscar-nominated film producer and author of Move Fast And Break Things. “At the end of the day there will be three giant players. Not 10, or even 6. That’s the bet Netflix is making. When they get to 200m or 250m subscribers then they will have all the power and everyone will have to distribute their content through them.” 
Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said last week that Netflix planned to meet the competition by pouring money into its own programming. “We’re better off deciding our own destiny,” he said. 
Netflix has a big head start in streaming, with 140m subscribers worldwide, years of experience, and the ability and willingness to spend big on content — it has issued high-yield bonds to finance original programming, the latest being a $2bn issue in October. 
Meanwhile, AT&T must toe a careful line between short-term business decisions such as taking the $100m from Netflix, and committing to a long-term bet on its own streaming service. Through WarnerMedia, it has the largest library in Hollywood, the result of decades of investment. But if it gives that catalogue to Netflix, how will it lure people to its own platform? 
“The question is: do you want to harvest your business, or do you want to be around for a century?” said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research.
For now, AT&T has chosen to delay that decision. It has not decided whether it would also license Friends to Netflix for 2020, when it would presumably want to bring it to its own service, according to people briefed on the negotiations. 
Bob Iger, Disney chief executive, has said that its new Disney+ streaming service, will cater to “super-fans” of its blockbuster franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel. The goal is to “not necessarily be in the volume game, but to be in the quality game”, he said. 
AT&T has a similar message. Mr Stephenson said the company does not want to become “another Netflix …in terms of being a warehouse of content”, likening Netflix to Walmart. 
The next few years will be a period of reshuffling, as a dizzying number of new streaming services come to market from companies ranging from Discovery to Apple. The risk is that the push into streaming results in a solution that satisfies no one. As content gets pulled from some platforms and placed on new ones, consumers will be confused, while media companies will be shelling out billions to build out services that have no guarantee of success. 
What is certain is that there will be more decisions to be made about crown jewel shows. Analysts say the next big deal could be for The Office, the most-viewed TV show on Netflix, according to data company 7Park. Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, which owns the rights to The Office, declined to comment on that contract.
“If that’s how much Netflix had to pay to hang out with Friends for just a little while longer, you can bet there’s going to be a similar scramble to keep [The Office],” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.

https://www.ft.com/content/262c2db2-f4c1-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f,Matthew Garrahan,Netflix ready to take the stage at Pinewood Studios,2018-11-30,18:07:42,"Netflix is in advanced talks to take a long lease at Pinewood Studios and make the home of films such as Star Wars and James Bond its UK production hub, underlining the streaming service’s increasing role as a force in global entertainment production. 
Discussions with Pinewood have been taking place for several months and are at an advanced stage, according to multiple people briefed on the talks. 
Netflix, which will spend about $8bn on content this year, is looking for additional studio space across Europe having recently launched its first production hub on the continent with a 237,000 sq ft facility north of Madrid.
Netflix declined to comment. Pinewood did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Netflix has already secured soundstage and studio space in Los Angeles, leasing the Sunset Bronson studios on Sunset Boulevard — site of the original Warner Brothers studio — as well as a facility in New Mexico. 
But Pinewood would represent its biggest bet yet, given its central role in UK film production. 
The latest round of Star Wars films was produced at Pinewood and Episode IX in the series is currently shooting there. Walt Disney, which owns the series, has other projects in development but has not announced any details about shooting locations. 
Recommended
Netflix in August wrote to the local council in support of Pinewood’s planning application to expand its Shepperton facility, located south-west of London, saying it wanted to make “great use” of Pinewood’s sites for UK productions. The expansion has not yet received planning permission. 
Ty Warren, Netflix’s vice-president for physical production, added in the letter: “In 2018, Netflix plans to spend approximately $8bn on content worldwide, across more than 700 television and film productions. We would like to be able to produce more in the UK, and at Shepperton in particular; however, we are limited by the lack of available space.”
Netflix is planning to ramp up the number of European series, films and documentaries it makes next year as it steps up its competition with broadcasters on the continent.
It is on course to make 141 projects in Europe this year consisting of 81 original productions and 60 co-productions or programmes licensed from other producers. In 2019 it will make 221 projects, including 153 originals.
Pinewood Group is planning a £500m expansion of the Shepperton site to add 465,000 sq ft of additional stage space. It has owned the site since merging with Shepperton Studios in 2000, with films such as the 2017 remake of The Mummy shot there. The studio group is also expanding its Pinewood East site in Buckinghamshire.
Netflix has sharply increased its content investment in Europe this year and will spend close to $1bn on original productions across the continent. 
However, its ambitions have alarmed European broadcasters, which are struggling with the migration of audiences to on-demand services from “linear” viewing, when audiences tune in to watch at a particular time.
Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom, the UK media regulator, this week called on public service broadcasters to develop a jointly owned streaming service that would showcase the best British content and combat the rise of Netflix.

The streaming service is on course for 141 projects in Europe this year consisting of 81 original productions and 60 co-productions or programmes licensed from other producers. In 2019 it will make 221 projects, including 153 originals. 
Netflix has sharply increased its content investment in Europe this year and will spend close to $1bn on original productions across the continent. But its ambitions have alarmed European broadcasters, which are struggling with the migration of audiences to on-demand services from “linear” viewing, when audiences tune in to watch at a particular time. 
“A year ago we had one or two shows in Spain, next year we will have six or seven,” said Erik Barmack, Netflix’s vice-president of international originals. “We are ramping towards 10 to 12 in each country . . . it could be more in particular markets.”
Its new European projects include The Eddy, a musical drama series from Damien Chazelle, the director of La La Land, which will be filmed in Paris in French, English and Arabic. Netflix at present has 40 projects in production or being produced by partners in the UK, including acclaimed hits such as The Crown and Black Mirror. Its latest series, Sex Education, about the teenage son of a sex therapist, is set in Wales.
The company is a big buyer of programming from UK producers. The recent hit The Bodyguard was made by ITV and screened in the UK on BBC One, but Netflix owns the international rights and is showing it on its service.
“We’re seeing a need in our biggest European markets for more local series and regional programming,” Mr Barmack said, adding that the shows were crossing borders and attracting large audiences across Netflix’s international customer base. It has about 130m subscribers worldwide. 
The UK’s media watchdog this week urged the country’s public service broadcasters to collaborate on a jointly owned streaming service that could showcase the best British programming.

Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom, warned that “cord-cutting” — the cancellation of pricey cable or satellite subscriptions — was growing in the UK. “Cord-cutting is no longer just a US phenomenon,” she told the Outside the Box conference in London. “In the UK, for the first time ever last year, the amount spent on traditional pay TV fell, and the number of subscriptions was overtaken by the streaming services.”
Ms White said the country’s PSBs should develop a joint streaming service. “Each of the big broadcasters operates an on-demand service, such as the BBC with its iPlayer. “A common platform could combine the pulling power of Broadchurch, Blue Planet and Bake Off,” she said. 
Broadcasters are beginning to strike collaborative deals in response to the growth of Netflix and other streaming services. Discovery, the US media group that owns Eurosport, and ProSiebenSat.1, the German media company, are developing a subscription streaming service in Germany that will integrate their programming and digital services.

Sharon White’s speech at the Outside the Box conference in London on Wednesday will be the latest call to arms for an industry bruised by changes in audience behaviour and technological disruption. “If the growth of Netflix and Amazon tells us one thing, it is that viewers will flock to single destinations that offer a wide variety of quality content,” she will say.
Each of the big broadcasters operates an on-demand service, such as the BBC with its iPlayer. “A common platform could combine the pulling power of Broadchurch, Blue Planet and Bake Off,” Ms White plans to say. “It would make it easier for viewers to access content across a range of devices, with a single login.”
The UK’s PSBs worked on a joint streaming operation a decade ago in a project dubbed “Kangaroo” but the plans were ultimately blocked by the Competition Commission because of the impact a combined service would have had on the broader market.
But since then international players such as Netflix and Amazon have built large international streaming businesses, with Netflix alone having more than 9m paying members in the UK. The company is increasingly outbidding UK broadcasters for the best programmes and has made hits such as The Crown, a drama about the life of Queen Elizabeth II.
The UK PSBs have talked about renewing the Kangaroo project but discussions have not progressed. The BBC should “take the lead” on forming such a partnership, Ms White will say.
Her call for action comes as the broadcasters prepare to launch a new app that will aggregate their on-demand operations. Freeview, which is owned and run by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and Arqiva, will launch the app on Wednesday. It will initially be available on Apple iOS devices with plans to launch on Android early next year.
The app falls short of the “single login” offering envisaged by Ms White because viewers will still have to sign in to each individual service. However, Jonathan Thompson, the chief executive of Digital UK, the company that supports Freeview, said it was a positive example of media sector collaboration.
“The new app provides the aggregated experience that consumers increasingly expect from a TV provider,” he will say on Wednesday. It will put “the best of free-to-air content . . . in one place on mobile, just as we have on TV”.
The new app is the result of a new £125m, five-year deal by Freeview’s shareholders to develop new services.
Carolyn McCall and Alex Mahon, the new chief executives of ITV and Channel 4, have also talked of the need to join forces in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
BBC, Channel 4 and ITV are also pushing for the government to pass legislation that gives PSBs more prominence on new internet TV services. Ms White will tell the conference that Ofcom will advise the government next year “on how prominence in an online world might be made to work”.

Netflix will begin production on the first animated series, based on books beloved by children and brought to life by distinctive illustrations from Quentin Blake, in 2019. 
The list of titles in the agreement include Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, The Twits, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, George’s Marvellous Medicine, Boy — Tales of Childhood, Going Solo, The Enormous Crocodile, The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me, Henry Sugar, Billy and the Minpins, The Magic Finger, Esio Trot, Dirty Beasts, and Rhyme Stew. 
“We have great creative ambition to reimagine the journeys of so many treasured Dahl characters in fresh, contemporary ways with the highest quality animation and production values,” commented Melissa Cobb, vice-president of kids and family content at Netflix.
“Immersing ourselves in the extraordinary worlds of Roald Dahl stories has been an honour and a massive amount of fun, and we are grateful for the trust the Roald Dahl Story Company and the Dahl family have placed in our team to deliver more moments of shared joy to families around the world,” Ms Cobb continued.
Dahl’s works have over the years been variously adapted into live action and animated movies with mixed success.
The move comes as Netflix’s rivalry with Amazon and Disney is heating up. The latter is expected to launch its child-friendly streaming service Disney+ — which will focus on its five key franchises: Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Disney and National Geographic — at the end of next year. 
Netflix surpassed estimates for subscriber growth in its most recent quarterly results and plans to span $8bn on content this year as it seeks to lure in new customers and retain existing ones. Reed Hastings' company secured just over $2bn through its latest bond offering last month as creditors continue to foot the bill for its aggressive programming expansion.
Netflix shares, which are up nearly 37 year-to-date, were little changed at $262.22 at pixel time.

As the box office has become increasingly risky in the age of digital streaming, the big studios, including Paramount and Universal, have sold some castoff films to the likes of Netflix. However Paramount, under the lead of chief executive Jim Gianopulos, will now team up with Netflix from the start, producing explicitly for the tech company. 
“We have more capacity for great production than the theatrical release can accommodate,” Mr Gianopulos told investors on Friday.
Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are spending more than $20bn on content, Mr Gianopulos noted, describing this deal as a “new, incremental revenue stream”. He did not specify how many films Paramount would make for Netflix. 
The announcement came as the traditional cinema helped power better than forecast quarterly sales and earnings for Paramount’s parent company Viacom, as the latest Mission: Impossible film starring Tom Cruise grossed nearly $800m at the box office.
For its fiscal fourth quarter, Viacom made adjusted earnings of 99 cents a share on $3.49bn in sales. Wall Street analysts were looking for 95 cents on $3.34bn. 
The blockbuster hit Mission: Impossible — Fallout drove revenues at the Paramount film studio up 25 per cent to $984m, helping Paramount earn a $38m profit in the quarter. 
Viacom, which also runs cable channels including MTV, has been trying to turn around its fortunes as the cable television business is in long-term decline. While peers like Disney are looking to battle the streaming disrupters, Viacom chief Bob Bakish — installed two years ago by billionaire media titan Shari Redstone, Viacom’s controlling

		— is instead betting on co-operation.
Viacom has been making TV shows for services like Netflix and Amazon, which has helped grow licensing revenues. 
The company highlighted one such programme, the romantic comedy To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, which was produced for Netflix by Viacom-owned AwesomenessTV. Netflix said the film, released in August, was one of the most-watched ever on the platform, although it keeps viewership numbers a secret. 
Netflix, which has rattled the big studios that historically controlled Hollywood, recently made a significant concession to filmmakers and the traditional cinema. It said last month it would allow a trio of films to debut in cinemas ahead of introducing them on its streaming service. 
In another sign of the changing times for the media business, Viacom is reviving MTV’s reality TV show, The Real World — this time to air on Facebook. Viacom is also making programming for Amazon, such as the Paramount-produced television series Jack Ryan, produced by author Tom Clancy. 
On a call with investors, Mr Bakish dismissed concerns that making shows for tech platforms would further erode ratings for Viacom’s own cable channels, instead extolling the value of growing brands like MTV online. 
Viacom’s traditional cable business, still the biggest driver of revenues, fared less well in the quarter. Sales from its media networks unit, which includes cable channels MTV and FX, fell 1 per cent to $2.52bn in the quarter, weighed by a 6 per cent drop in advertising sales. 
For the full fiscal year ending in September, Viacom’s sales fell 2 per cent year-over-year to $12.9bn, while net earnings dropped 10 per cent to $1.7bn. Mr Bakish called it a “pivotal year for Viacom”, in which the company “successfully turned around our core business”. 
Shares in Viacom fell 2 per cent in early trading in New York.

The move could open the door to Netflix’s first best picture nomination at the Academy Awards early next year. 
Roma, the latest film by Oscar-winner Alfonso Cuarón, will be screened at a limited number of cinemas in New York and Los Angeles starting on November 21, almost a month before it arrives on Netflix’s own app, the company said on Wednesday. 
That marks a reversal by Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, who told investors just two weeks ago that he was committed to a “member-centric simultaneous release model”, launching its growing slate of original movies online and offline at the same time. 
Roma, seen as Netflix’s strongest Oscar contender, will go live on the streaming service worldwide on December 14, at which point it will get a wider theatrical release in more than 20 markets, including some screenings on a high-resolution 70mm print. 
Mr Cuarón, the acclaimed director of Gravity, has already won a clutch of awards on this year’s film festival circuit for Roma, a drama set in 1970s Mexico and shot in black and white. 
“There’s been an overwhelming response to all of our films this festival season, and this plan is building on that momentum,” said Scott Stuber, head of Netflix’s film group. 
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, the latest from Joel and Ethan Coen, the writer-director siblings who have previously won Oscars for Fargo and No Country for Old Men, will hit the big screen a week before it lands on Netflix. 
Recommended
In December, the streaming pioneer will also give the big-screen treatment to Bird Box, a new film from Susanne Bier, the Danish director behind the TV series The Night Manager and 2010’s Oscar-winning In a Better World. 
Netflix released more than 30 films in cinemas last year, mainly at smaller cinema chains such as Landmark and iPic. Those movies included Mudbound, which was nominated for four Oscars this year, as well as Bright, War Machine and The Meyerowitz Stories, which all featured big-name Hollywood actors such as Will Smith and Brad Pitt. 
However, Roma, Buster Scruggs and Bird Box will be receiving a much bigger push. While it takes only a few screenings to qualify a film for entry to the Oscars, Academy voters are believed to look more favourably on movies that have a wider release. 
“Netflix’s priority is our members and our filmmakers, and we are constantly innovating to serve them,” said Mr Stuber. 
Keeping filmmakers happy is important for the company, to ensure that it can keep attracting talent and content. As Netflix is notoriously secretive about the viewing figures for anything shown on its service, awards can be a vital badge of success for creators. 
Netflix’s Oscar drive follows a strong showing for its original TV shows at the Emmys. It won 23 awards this year, tying with HBO for the largest number of wins. 
However, the company has not succeeded in replicating its success in TV shows with movies.

https://www.ft.com/content/ec2b5fc7-979c-37db-aa1f-739bff4de5a1,Jamie Powell,"Netflix, consider the convertible bond",2018-10-23,12:55:34,"Monday brought the news Netflix was once again tapping the bond market for financing. $2bn this time, to add to its $8.3bn of debt, which the company intends to use for “content acquisitions, production and development”, among other corporate-y things.
Yet, having already spent $292m on interest so far this year, and burnt $1.7bn in cash, are vanilla bonds the best way for Netflix to fuel its content spending spree?
Some, such as the FT a few months ago, have suggested Netflix raise equity instead. It adds up: its shares are pretty pricey no matter which way you spin it. According to S&P Capital IQ, its stock is trading at a heady 101 times projected earnings for the next 12 months. Add net debt to its market capitalisation to get a $149bn enterprise value, and the numbers are even crazier: its EV/ebitda multiple (again, projected forward a year), is 66.
And that's with the equity 21 per cent off its summer (heights) highs:
But, following a letter from a reader over the summer, Alphaville has another suggestion for Netflix's treasury department: a convertible bond.
First, because Netflix could save serious money on interest payments. The $1.9bn 2028 unsecured bond it raised in April pays a coupon of 5.875 per cent, according to S&P Capital IQ. That translates to $112m per year in cash flowing out to investors. 
Convertible bonds, however, carry far lower interest rates. Take Tesla's $230m convert, which matures next week, for example. It only pays a 2.75 per cent coupon despite its senior unsecured bonds yielding 8.4 per cent at pixel. With Netflix's 2028 bond yielding only 6.2 per cent, it is fair to say it could at least secure similar terms to the electric car company, even in today's higher interest-rate environment.
Of course, the reason convertible investors accept a lower coupon is the equity upside. Convertible bonds are, erm, convertible to equity at a premium — often around 30 per cent — to the share price at issuance, and Netflix's shares offer the tempting promise of share price growth in spades. Despite its recent fall, the company's stock is up 635 per cent over the past five years, and 72 per cent year to date, according to Bloomberg. As we discussed last week, with favourable customer economics driving its international growth, a convertible investor may take the view Netflix's stock has plenty of room to run.
What's not to love then? Well, dilution for one: eventually the bond will convert to more shares, assuming of course the shares crack the convertible's strike price, meaning a smaller slice of the pie for current shareholders. Yet, Netflix could take some steps to mitigate this, using some of the proceeds to purchase long-dated call options, or by stashing away some of the cash for buying back shares, if needs be.
Note though, that any future dilution will not be as extreme as with a straight equity raise. For instance, if Netflix were to raise $2bn of equity at yesterday's closing price of $329.54, it would need to issue around 6m shares, reducing shareholders' cut by 1.4 per cent.
However, if the theoretical convertible's strike price was 30 per cent higher, at $428, the future dilutive effect would only be 1.1 per cent. Not bad at all. And it could be even less if Netflix continues to issue shares to employees as part of their compensation packages.
So by raising a convertible, Netflix could save money on interest costs, meaning more cash for projects such as Guillermo Del Toro's upcoming Pinocchio, while also reducing the dilutive effect of a normal equity raise. With the US convertible market on track to have its best year since the crisis, according to Barclays, the appetite from investors is there. The real question is, why isn't Netflix feeding them?

		than initially expected amid a volatile day for broader financial markets, according to people with knowledge of the deal.
Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, has already turned to the $1.3tn high-yield bond market to pay for original programming, such as Stranger Things, that has helped attract millions of new subscribers. Netflix said it would pour up to $8bn into content this year, although some analysts think the number could hit $13bn. 
John McClain, a portfolio manager with Diamond Hill Capital, said he expected Netflix to continue to tap the corporate bond market in the years to come. 
“They are going to persistently come to market and that’s OK as long as every dollar they are borrowing is creating more than that in value,” he said. “That is certainly the case for them. It makes sense for them to tap the high-yield bond market. Borrowing at 5, 6 or 7 per cent is a much cheaper cost of funding.”
Netflix was finalising a capital raise in both euros and dollars, with the $800m tranche of the bond expected to price with a yield of roughly 6.375 per cent, according to people familiar with the matter. The US dollar notes mature in 10.5 years. The €1.1bn tranche was set to price with a yield of 4.625 per cent, the people added. Yields on both notes were priced an eighth of a percentage point above the levels marketed to investors late on Monday.
Earlier this month Netflix said it signed up nearly 7m new customers last quarter, well above analysts’ estimates, and forecast that it would add a record 29m subscribers this year. Although Netflix shares have fallen about 20 per cent from the record set in July, they remain up more than 50 per cent this year.
Netflix forecasts it will use up to $3bn in cash this year, a sum Mr Hastings insisted will reap long term benefits. 
“You’re using the word loss and I think you mean investment,” he told analysts on a call this month. “We definitely hope that they’re not turning into losses. A track record would show that those investments have turned out to be very successful for us.”
The company unveiled 676 hours of programming in the third quarter, a company record and more than double from a year ago, according to Cowen & Company. 
The rapid pace at which Netflix uses up cash has been a focus for investors, particularly as other highly valued tech companies such as WeWork and Uber test the junk bond market. Christian Hoffmann, a portfolio manager with Thornburg Investment Management, said the group of sub-investment-grade companies had so far won the backing of bond investors because of their sky-high equity valuations, even as they lacked “robust credit metrics”.
“Most companies that burn cash and have high leverage, the market normally shies away from,” he said. “But that is not the case here. Some investors feel supported by the loan to value argument.”
Analysts with rating agency S&P Global last week upgraded their view of Netflix, lifting their rating one notch to double B minus. Rival agency Moody’s said it believed Netflix would top 200m subscribers by the end of 2021 and that it would stop bleeding cash within five years as its margins rise. Moody’s rates Netflix Ba3, three notches below investment grade and equivalent to S&P’s opinion.
The bond sale was being led by Morgan Stanley, alongside Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo. 
Netflix declined to comment.

The company behind hit shows such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black is planning to spend more than $8bn on original content this year, up from $6bn in 2017.
To fund this, Netflix has been tapping the debt rather than the equity markets — even though its shares have surged more than 73 per cent this year. It last raised $1.9bn in April and $1.6bn in October last year. 
Pressure to keep increasing its content budget is only growing as more deep-pocketed rivals have piled into the streaming video market that Netflix pioneered.

Netflix justifies its ballooning investments as vital to gaining and retaining viewers, particularly as media companies have pulled back on giving a rival rights to show their programming. Netflix has spent robustly on original and local language content as it as rolled out services around the world, including in India, where it launched its first original series, Sacred Games, this year.
News of the bond issue comes less than a week after Netflix reported stronger-than-expected earnings and subscriber gains for the third quarter. That eased worries that the company might repeat a miss in subscriber gains in the second quarter that sent its stock plunging in July.
While the results and the accompanying upbeat fourth-quarter guidance have helped allay concerns over slowing momentum at Netflix, some analysts remain wary over the group’s cash burn rate. It forecast a free cash burn of $3bn this year and another $3bn in 2019 — although it expects an improvement after that.
Long-term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from the $6.5bn reported at the end of 2017.

		financed content factory announced 7m new subscribers in the third quarter, a third more than the 5.3m predicted by analysts. Netflix also said it expects to add another 9.4m in the final months of the year, after which it's share price shot up 8 per cent:
It was a mirror image of the second-quarter results, when Netflix missed subscriber expectations, and the price dropped 5.2 per cent:
Subscriber growth is obviously a crucial indication of prospects for the business. More subscribers means higher revenues, more cash to spend on content, which attracts new subscribers, and the wheels roll round and round.
But Alphaville isn't convinced the subs number is the only figure that matters for the streaming leviathan founded by Reed Hastings. The cost of finding subscribers, and the money that will be eventually squeezed from them, provides another way to assess the prospects of one of the most hyped companies on the stock market. 
Silicon Valley loves subscriber businesses because customers, once signed up, provide dependable monthly cash flows. For internet businesses, there is little additional cost in providing the product to a new subscriber. And crucially, if the product works, prices can be pushed up without customers unsubscribing. Business software groups SalesForce and Slack, for instance, fit the bill. 
Looking for the next big thing, venture capitalists, will often compare the estimated lifetime value of a customer to the cost of persuading them to sign up (or in the jargon, the customer acquisition cost). 
Let's take a look at how Netflix's customer lifetime value to acquisition cost ratio (LTV to CAC ratio, as it is known in the trade), and what it says about the quality of its astonishing expansion.
Calculating the customer acquisition cost for Netflix is easy — take the segmented marketing costs (handily provided by the company), and divide by the number of paid subscribers added. Here it is for the past 11 quarters, split for the domestic (US) and international figures:
A few things to tease out. First is the high cost of acquiring US customers, an issue Netflix seemed to have under control in 2017, but the expense has spiked back to 2016's levels in the past two quarters. US growth has slowed — Netflix added 998k paid subscribers this quarter versus 1.02m the same period in 2017 — and it is spending more to achieve it, with marketing costs 42 per cent higher than last year, at $184m 
Analysts at both Moffett Nathanson and Goldman Sachs list competition as a key risk, and ballooning marketing costs do suggest growing competition from Amazon's Prime service, as well as that soon to come from Disney and, as of last week, Warner Media. It seems retaining, rather than growing domestic subscribers, may soon be the name of the game. 
Of course, with higher monthly revenue per paid subscriber in the US, $11.30 versus $8.95 elsewhere, Netflix may think the spend is worth it.
Which brings us to the second part of our calculation — the lifetime value of a Netflix subscriber. To work this out: 
Here's the average revenue per user figures, again for the US and International arms, and for the whole business:
Last quarter was the first time in nearly three years that average revenue per paid subscriber fell from one quarter to the next, dropping from $30.67 to $29.98. The reason is overseas expansion, as Netflix brings in subscribers with less spending power.
On to stage 2 of our calculation: the profitability per user. So that's the numbers above, multiplied by the gross margin (revenues, minus the cost of providing the service):
Gross profitability per subscriber has begun to fall, both in the US and abroad. A similar blip occurred in 2017, so it would be unwise to read too much into this, yet. But perhaps it does speak to the escalating cost of creating original hit shows, particularly in the States. Last year a study by Tim Mulligan at MIDiA Research found that the 22 largest TV networks in the US spent $53bn on content, a 45 per cent increase from 2012. In short, there's a lot of money chasing an elite pool of TV talent. 
Increased costs for high-quality television may be a concern for investors, but Netflix shows no sign of cutting budgets. According to this quarter's

		statement, so far this year they've spent $9.3bn on streaming content assets, $2bn more than at the same point in 2017. While we're often sceptical of finance theory, there is something to be said for the popular idea that paying more for an asset reduces its future returns.
Lower gross margins in the future due to higher content costs might effect the lifetime value assessment, but lets stick with existing numbers for now. So we've got the first two parts of our customer lifetime value calculation, leaving just the churn rate.
Imagine our sadness when we found out Netflix have not disclosed its churn rate since 2010. In fact, according to an article from the San Francisco Business Times, Netflix swotted away the Securities and Exchange Commission's requests for it to do so. Apparently “the churn metric is a less reliable measure of business performance, specifically consumer acceptance of the service.” Right.
The likelihood of a subscriber cancelling is a pretty important part of estimating their value, so the proportion who do opt-out each quarter is a key part of our calculation. 
There are a range of churn estimates available. For instance, MIDiA Research estimated Netflix's churn in 2017 to average 9.6 per cent per quarter, thanks in part to the October price hike. In the first half of 208, they estimate the rate dropped to 7 per cent each quarter, which equates to 28 per cent of the customer base tuning out every year.
Other estimates come in lower. As one example, research-shop Ampere indicate an annual churn rate of 20 per cent, or 5 per cent per quarter. Yet, one media analyst we spoke to seemed to think this was low, given US cable churn rates come in at close to 7 per cent per quarter, and that's with minimum contract lengths. A Netflix subscriber is free to leave at any time, and Recurly Research estimate video-on-demand churn rates to run at 11 per cent monthly, a third of subscribers per quarter, as customers switch between services.
So, given the range of estimates above, 9 per cent a quarter feels about right, if we want to be reasonably conservative. (Feel free to put us right in the comments).
Input this churn number into our Excel sheet, and voila: we now have the lifetime value of a paid subscriber to Netflix:
But that isn't really what we're after, what we want to know is the ratio between how much money a paid subscriber is worth — the lifetime value — and how much it costs Netflix to pull one in to its platform — the customer acquisition cost.
Dim the lights.
Drum roll please . . .
And raise the curtain:
First, to point out the obvious, both international and domestic subscribers are still just about worth the marketing dollars to Netflix.
In the US, for instance, the ratio stood at exactly 1 this quarter, after dipping into negative territory last. Suggesting that Netflix would do well to rein back its marketing spend domestically, as each customer is worth $184, almost exactly what they cost to acquire (assuming our estimate of the churn rate is accurate). The company could also choose to raise prices, as it did last October, and keep its marketing spend flat. Whether this is possible in the face of competition from rival streaming services is another matter.
Internationally, Netflix's LTV to CAC ratio is far higher — 1.80 last quarter — suggesting its marketing dollars are still worth the outlay. Yet international markets do hold some worries in the future, according to the wonks at Buckingham Research Group. They note ""77 per cent of anticipated global streaming member growth through 2025 is from more challenging markets outside the US and Western Europe . . .[and] . . . we still feel the Indian market will remain competitively intense and difficult to monetise”. Yet given its significant head start, and a good return on its marketing spend, it hard to see Netflix slowing down overseas in the coming years.
So, the fundamentals of the business aren't broken. Netflix appears to maintain healthy and rapid growth outside of the US, which could fuel expansion of the business — and that virtuous circle we described above — for years ahead. 
How investors choose to value a business growing like that, well, that's another question entirely.

Shares in the online video company jumped more than 8 per cent at the open as investors cheered Netflix’s blowout earnings and subscriber gains, which have helped allay concerns over slowing momentum that have dogged the stock in recent months. 
The company behind hit shows such as House of Cards, Lost in Space and Orange is the New Black added nearly 7m net new subscribers in the third quarter — exceeding the 5.3m Wall Street analysts were expecting and the 5m its executives had predicted three months ago.
Netflix also said it was expecting to add 1.5m and 6.1m domestic and international paid subscribers, compared to previous guidance of 1.35m and 5.2m.
The figures should go some ways to reassuring investors who fear Netflix might repeat a shock miss in subscriber additions in its second-quarter report in July, which sent its stock plunging. 
“Upside in both third-quarter results and the fourth-quarter guide essentially . . . confirms our view that second-quarter softness did not reflect any fundamental change in the business,” said Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan.
Recommended
William Power at Baird added that international growth was especially encouraging. “The standout was the strong fourth-quarter international guidance,” he said. “International growth remains broad-based, with the company calling out Asia as a growing contributor.”
Despite Wednesday’s gains, the stock remains down 11 per cent from its June high of $423.20. 
Shares are nonetheless up 93 per cent for the year, underscoring the scale of Netflix’s stunning rally, which in May briefly propelled the company’s market capitalisation above of that of Walt Disney to make it the most valuable media group in the US.
Not everyone was blown away by Netflix’s latest results, however. Analysts at Keybanc downgraded their rating on the stock to “sector weight” from “overweight”, arguing that they see limited upside to the shares.
“While we remain positive on Netflix’s opportunity to grow subscribers and revenue, we believe revenue growth and accelerating margin expansion are needed to drive substantial upside from here,” they wrote. “The latter has not developed at a pace that exceeds our expectations, which suggests upside is more limited.”
Cash burn could also be another headwind given the company’s frantic pace of spending on original content such as the series Maniac, which starts Hollywood A-lister Emma Stone and comic actor Jonah Hill. 
Netflix forecast a free cash burn of $3bn this year and another $3bn in 2019 but expects an improvement after that. 
Long term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from the $6.5bn reported at the end of 2017. The amount spent on interest payments meanwhile totalled $291.6m for the first nine months of the year, compared to $238m for the whole of 2017.

The video streaming company added nearly 7m net new subscribers in the third quarter — exceeding the 5.3m Wall Street analysts were expecting and the 5m its executives had predicted three months ago. It now counts more than 137m subscribers globally.
Shares jumped as much as 16 per cent in after-hours trading in New York. The rise eased in pre-market action on Wednesday, with the stock up 12 per cent ahead of the Wall Street open.
The results eased worries Netflix might repeat an unusual miss in subscriber additions in its second-quarter report in July, which had then sent its stock plunging.
Overall, this was a strong quarter for the company. Normal service has been restored
The July report brought a sudden end to a rally that had seen Netflix shares more than double between early January and mid-July. The pressure has only been amplified by the recent sell-off among other previously high-flying technology stocks.
Investors and analysts keep a close eye on Netflix’s ability to attract new subscribers as it pours money into new films and television shows.
The company plans to spend $8bn on content this year and has justified its investments as vital to gaining and retaining viewers amid increasing competition from the likes of Walt Disney, Amazon and AT&T.
The company relies on debt to finance its ballooning levels of content spending. It said it now anticipates free cash outflows of about $3bn in 2018, down from an earlier forecast of $4bn.
In the third quarter, Netflix reported robust subscriber growth both in its home country and in international markets where it has made a big push in recent years. It added 1.1m subscribers in the US and 5.9m in other countries, ahead of its own forecast of 650,000 and 4.35m, respectively.
“Overall, this was a strong quarter for the company. Normal service has been restored,” said Paolo Pescatore, a telecoms and media analyst. “More importantly, strong growth in its overseas market is encouraging.”
Reflecting the scrutiny given to Netflix’s subscriber growth, the company said it would focus on a metric it can forecast more accurately: net growth in paid subscribers. This excludes people who use free trial memberships to its service.
Starting in January, Netflix will only issue guidance for paid memberships, Reed Hastings, chief executive, wrote in his letter to shareholders, saying they were “a more reliable indicator of revenue growth”.
Third-quarter net income surged to $403m, or 89 cents a share, from $130m, or 29 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 34 per cent to $4bn. Analysts had estimated earnings of 68 cents a share and $4bn in revenue, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Recommended
During the quarter, new seasons of popular Netflix shows such as Orange is the New Black, Bojack Horseman and American Vandal were accompanied by new original franchises such as Maniac and Sacred Games, its first original series in India. The company also noted the success of original films including the romantic comedy To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.
Netflix gave bullish guidance for the current quarter, forecasting the addition of another 9.4m subscribers globally, ahead of analysts’ forecasts of 8.35m, according to FactSet.

Shares in the video streaming company rallied 4 per cent on Wednesday, buoyed by better than expected subscriber data in its latest financial quarter. The rise extended a run that has lifted its stock more than 90 per cent since the start of 2018.
Despite the rise in Netflix shares, the New York Stock Exchange’s Fang+ index remained lodged in negative territory on Wednesday, down 0.31 per cent from Tuesday’s close.
The benchmark, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google-parent Alphabet and other popular tech names, is down almost 15 per cent from its all-time high struck in June. 
That stumble has been closely watched by Wall Street and global investors, as investing in Faang stocks has been one of the most lucrative and popular trades in recent years. 
For the year to date, the Fang index is 17.8 per cent higher, and the trade has been responsible for driving much of the wider 2018 rally in US stock markets. 
“The concentration of performance in the Faangs over the last three years causes numerous investors to be concerned and rightly so,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations. 
“We need to see more depth and breadth of performance to the market to instil more confidence. That is why today, you aren’t seeing more buyers.”
As investors have increased their exposure to the stocks, there is a rising awareness that a concentration of capital in a select few companies has raised the risk that a fall in their prices could magnify losses across the market should turbulence persist. 
Fund managers surveyed by Bank of America ranked the long-Faang position, combined with a long position in the Chinese equivalent BAT trade, which includes Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as the most crowded for the ninth consecutive month.
Combined with a record proportion of investors believing the global economy is in the late stage of the economic cycle, increasing the likelihood that any dip will become a concerted downturn, the exposure to tech stocks threatens to ripple through other sectors should investors rush to sell.
The upcoming earnings season is seen as an important test for other big tech names and for Wall Street more broadly. 
“Netflix is important short term, but as soon as the next tech bellwether company reports, it will be forgotten,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. “It is a sort of ‘what have you done for me lately’ mindset.”

Shareholders in what was briefly the world’s most valuable media company were left with a cliffhanger after Netflix’s last quarterly earnings report, when it missed its own forecasts by 1m subscribers. Netflix executives blamed their own internal forecasting for the misfire. 
The shock brought to a sudden end one of this year’s strongest rallies, with Netflix shares more than doubling between early January and mid-July. The pressure on Netflix’s shares has only been amplified by the recent sell-off among high-flying technology stocks. 
By the beginning of this week, the stock was still trading more than 15 per cent below the $400 level last seen three months ago, when Netflix’s market capitalisation had overtaken that of Walt Disney. 
Netflix bulls have been cheered by a report from the app analytics provider Sensor Tower that pointed to a return to the forecast-busting growth to which Wall Street had become accustomed. 
Sensor Tower estimated that third-quarter revenues from in-app subscriptions had increased more than 90 per cent year on year to $243.7m in the third quarter, thanks to more than 50m new app installations. 
As well as surging in newer markets such as Brazil and India, the data provider reported strong growth in the US, where some analysts had been concerned that saturation was limiting its scope for new subscribers. 
During the quarter, new seasons of popular Netflix shows such as Orange is the New Black, Bojack Horseman and American Vandal were accompanied by new original franchises such as Sacred Games and Maniac. 
Recommended
But analysts at Goldman Sachs warned on Monday that even if Netflix does beat its target of 5m net additional streaming subscribers for the third quarter, investors were still bracing for “more conservative” fourth-quarter guidance. 
Goldman’s analysts predicted a big jump in content spending in the second half of the year, with cash burn likely to increase from $2bn last year to $3.3bn in 2018. 
It cut its price target from $470 to $430, saying that other internet companies are trading off lower price-to-earnings ratios. Netflix’s enterprise value is currently 47.5 times its estimated ebitda for 2019, compared with 14 times for the sector as a whole. 
But the analysts also said that Wall Street “continues to underestimate the size of Netflix’s global addressable market, the impact of incremental content spending, and the growing value of Netflix to both distributors and content creators”.
The pressure on Netflix to keep increasing its multibillion-dollar content budget — estimated to hit $13bn this year — is only increasing as more and more rivals emerge in the video streaming market. 
Recommended
As well as the long-anticipated debuts of new streaming apps from Disney and Apple next year, AT&T executives have said they plan to launch a new online video service that would include content from Warner Bros and HBO by the end of 2019. 
Other retailers are following in the footsteps of Amazon Prime Video, with Wal-Mart and Costco reported to be trying to beef up their online channels. 
At the same time as physical retailers are looking to digital entertainment, Netflix is starting to embrace the traditional movie theatre alongside its latest push into feature films. The streaming pioneer is hoping that a theatrical release will capitalise on the buzz at recent film festivals surrounding three films: Roma, 22 July and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.

https://www.ft.com/content/a9f5bea8-bb58-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5,Anna Nicolaou,Viacom strikes Nickelodeon deal with Netflix,2018-09-18,21:17:05,"Viacom, owner of MTV and Paramount Pictures, has struck a deal to produce a new Nickelodeon series exclusively for Netflix, the latest move by chief executive Bob Bakish to push the company into a future beyond traditional television. 
While his peers have tried to battle streaming disrupters, Mr Bakish — installed two years ago by billionaire media titan Shari Redstone — is instead betting on co-operation. 
Viacom’s deal with the streaming service is the latest in a handful of such experiments the company has made in the past year to reverse its fortunes. 
Mr Bakish said the field for Netflix imitators, with traditional media companies launching their own streaming alternatives, was “going to get crowded”. “Look at what Disney is doing. Look at AT&T-Time Warner. It’s unclear what Comcast is going to do,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “With all that happening . . . developing a Netflix-like service does not make sense for Viacom.”
Mr Bakish has had his work cut out. Viacom, like its peers, has been hit by a shift from traditional television towards online alternatives, resulting in plunging viewership for storied channels such as MTV. Looming in the background, Viacom’s fate has been clouded by a power struggle between the Redstone family, which owns Viacom and CBS, and Les Moonves, who last week resigned as chief executive of CBS in the wake of sexual assault allegations. 
Ms Redstone has tried to merge Viacom with CBS, but Mr Moonves resisted. With Ms Redstone now firmly in control, analysts speculate that a deal could be back on the cards.
Mr Bakish said he saw “substantial synergies” for a combination with CBS. However he insists that Viacom is not actively looking for large deals. “If I had been distracted by [the deal rumours this year] . . . that would have been a bad thing,” he said. “I said: maybe a deal will get done, maybe it won’t, we’re going to keep focusing on Viacom.”
Viacom has revived decades-old shows like “The Hills” and “Jersey Shore”, which has helped bring viewers back to MTV — primetime ratings have climbed for four consecutive quarters. 
Mr Bakish hopes to work similar magic at Nickelodeon, where year-over-year ratings have shrunk by more than 20 per cent for all but three weeks of this year, according to Bernstein. To that end Viacom on Tuesday unveiled another revival — “Avatar: The Last Airbender”, an animated TV series that last aired in 2008, when it was syndicated television to 105 countries. This time around, it will only be available on Netflix. 
As part of the settlement agreed last week, several Moonves loyalists have left the CBS board, and the company dropped its lawsuit which attempted to dilute Ms Redstone’s voting power in CBS. The Redstones said they do not plan to propose a merger of CBS with Viacom for two years — but the independent board members are free to push for a deal. 
“[CBS] has a new board, that board has to get settled in and they have to decide what they want to do,” Mr Bakish said. “I’m not concerned about my fate,” he said, of the uncertainty about how Ms Redstone will proceed. “In some earlier discussions, people said I wouldn’t have a job. That was fine with me. I’m just focused on Viacom.”
Of the departure of Mr Moonves, one of the most powerful Hollywood executives to lose his job in the #metoo era, Mr Bakish declined to comment. “A lot has been written about that topic,” he said. “I don’t have anything to add.”

https://www.ft.com/content/ef05f706-b6e4-11e8-bbc3-ccd7de085ffe,Anna Nicolaou,Netflix sets its sights on the silver screen,2018-09-13,13:52:18,"Alfonso Cuarón, the acclaimed director of Gravity, arrived in Toronto this week to promote his first film in five years. Roma, an intimate drama set in 1970s Mexico and shot in black-and-white, has been described as a “masterpiece”, winning the grand prize at the Venice film festival and instantly becoming a contender for Academy Awards.
But the film has perhaps garnered just as much attention for being distributed by Netflix, which has stormed the autumn festivals in recent weeks as it aims for a standout success in film — a format that has not lent itself as easily to streaming as television. While series such as Stranger Things and Orange Is The New Black made Netflix a singular force in TV, it has yet to repeat that performance with movies. 
“For the past year, [Netflix] has been the topic of conversation at most meetings,” said the chief executive of a film financing company. “At first there was this glorification . . . that Netflix was saving the business. Then there was backlash. And now we’re in this period of questioning: what exactly are they doing?”
Netflix wants to change that view. A year and a half ago, it hired producer Scott Stuber to develop its film business. This autumn will be the first big test of Mr Stuber’s strategy, as a number of projects under his watch debut in the coming months. 
The Toronto International Film Festival, which has become an unofficial start to the six-month Oscar’s race, welcomed Mr Cuarón with a lavish red carpet gala, where he dutifully thanked Netflix executives for “bringing this film to the world”. Roma, one of Mr Stuber’s first projects to hit the screens, is set to be shown nine times in Toronto as part of a marketing blitz by Netflix, and observers speculate it could finally yield the company a coveted best picture nomination.
The push comes at a crucial time for Netflix, whose years-long stock rally was abruptly halted this summer after the company revealed a rare miss in quarterly subscriber growth — more than $20bn was wiped from its market value minutes after the news broke. However, despite the slowdown, Neftlix gave no indication that it would cut spending this year; rather, it insists that investing in new content is the key to attracting customers.
Analysts agree. “Having great movies that are exclusive to the platform is absolutely critical,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG. That said, “it’s really early . . . we haven’t seen any of [Stuber’s] films come out yet”.
The company has taken on more than $8.3bn in long-term debt to fund its original content, and expects free cash outflows of as much as $4bn for 2018. Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix promised investors in July that its films would become as successful as its TV shows, “but it will take another year or so as we get into it”. 
Netflix’s presence hung heavily over Toronto this week as Roma’s rapturous reception reignited a debate about the future of the movie business. The company brought eight films to Toronto, including Outlaw King, a Scottish war drama that opened the festival — the first time a big festival has given the highest profile slot to any streaming service. It was also very much in evidence at the Venice and Telluride festivals a few weeks ago.
This was in sharp contrast with its Cannes experience earlier this year. Cannes’ leadership banned Netflix films from competing for awards unless it showed them in French cinemas. Netflix refused and pulled out of the festival entirely.
The sticking point was that Netflix releases its films online at the same time as in cinemas — if they place them there at all — which has infuriated cinema owners. Netflix has been firm in this strategy, but it has been rumoured that the company might compromise and give Roma a traditional cinema release in its Oscar quest. Netflix has not yet made this decision on Roma, according to industry executives familiar with the matter.
Amazon and Apple also descended upon Toronto which, like Sundance, is a showcase for awards-worthy movies that have not yet secured distribution deals. Netflix also competes against established studios such as Universal Pictures, Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, and Warner Bros. 
Some filmmakers argue that Netflix and Amazon are funding smaller films that the studios have turned away from in favour of big blockbusters. Producer James D Stern worked with Netflix on the films Come Sunday and The Discovery, and “in both cases, I’m not sure those films would get made at all without Netflix”, he says. 
Distributing with Netflix also makes for “a lot less pressure”, said Mr Stern, who produced The Old Man and The Gun, a Robert Redford western that premiered in Toronto this week. “You can make the right film for the right money, without dying on opening weekend because you’re looking at every ticket.”

The British executive is a seasoned Silicon Valley operator who worked at Uber and Google before she moved to Facebook last year. She joins Netflix as it is spending an increasing share of its $8bn programming budget outside the US: it recently revealed plans to spend about $1bn on original productions in Europe alone. 
Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said Ms Whetstone’s “deep knowledge and international expertise” would be “invaluable as we bring Netflix and its expanding line-up of original content to an increasingly global audience”. 
Ms Whetstone joined Facebook a year ago as vice-president of communications for Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. This followed a two-year stint at Uber, where she was hired as the ride-sharing group tried to build a more experienced management team following a period of rapid growth.
Before Uber, she spent a decade at Google, where, as senior vice-president of communications and public policy, she had a ringside seat as the company grew to become a leader in search, adding new products and services. In that time, Google also ran into regulatory trouble in Europe, where it was investigated by the European Commission over claims that it had abused its dominant position in search. 
This European experience will be important in her new role at Netflix, given that European media companies are increasingly wary of the company and the implications of its growth on public service broadcasters.
As one of the so-called “Faangs”— a group of tech stocks that includes Facebook and Google — Netflix has attempted to win over European governments sceptical of the inroads it has made against state broadcasters by highlighting the jobs it creates through its work in Europe.
Netflix shares have soared in recent years thanks to strong subscriber growth outside its core US market. The shares slumped last month on disappointing subscriber growth, ending a year-long rally, although they have since won back some of their losses.
Earlier in her career, Ms Whetstone worked at Conservative central office in London alongside the likes of future chancellor George Osborne. She joined Google in 2005. 
She is married to Steve Hilton, the former top David Cameron adviser who fell out with the UK prime minister over immigration and Brexit: Mr Hilton now presents his own television show on Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News Channel.

		in 2002, the company’s share price has increased by more than 1,000 per cent, with subscribers rising from 20m at the end of 2010 to more than 130m in the most recent quarter. 
Mr Wells has presided over Netflix’s huge investment into original content, now running at $8bn a year, as well as taking on substantial debt to finance it. His 14 years at the Silicon Valley-based online video company recently included a two-year posting in Amsterdam, to help develop its European expansion. 
“After discussing my desire to make a change with Reed [Hastings, chief executive], we agreed that with Netflix’s strong financial position and exciting growth plans, this is the right time for us to help identify the next financial leader for the company,” Mr Wells said in a statement on Monday. 
Mr Wells, 47, said he wanted the next chapter of his life to focus more on philanthropy, but was also interested in “big challenges”.
Netflix shares were hit last month after the company revealed it added 1m fewer subscribers than expected during its second quarter and issued a conservative outlook for the current quarter.

It expects free cash outflows of as much as $4bn for 2018 and said it would continue to finance its spending on content through debt rather than by tapping equity markets.
The company blamed its own internal forecasting errors for the disappointment, which was its biggest miss in two years. 
Netflix shares are down 17 per cent from their record high in early July but are still up by about 70 per cent in the year to date. The stock was down about 1 per cent on Monday after news of Mr Wells’ planned departure. 
To fuel its push into original shows, which began in earnest with the release of House of Cards in 2013, Netflix has taken on more than $8.3bn in long-term debt, as of the most recent quarter. At the end of June, the company had $18.4bn in total streaming content obligations, including both licensed and original TV shows and movies. The final season of House of Cards is expected to air in November. 
According to Netflix’s annual proxy statement in April, Mr Wells was due to be paid $2.8m this year, including an annual

The SEC’s ruminations on social media disclosure dates back to July 2012, when Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, wrote on his personal Facebook page that the streaming service had just enjoyed a record-breaking month. That caused Netflix’s shares to rocket higher once traders cottoned on to the posting.

		initially took a dim view of this possible breach of “Regulation Fair Disclosure”, and served Mr Hastings with a notice warning that it would probably bring some kind of action against the Netflix chief. Mr Hastings countered that he had 200,000 subscribers to his Facebook page, so the post should be considered a public disclosure, and pointed out the company had already disclosed it was approaching the 1bn hours of streaming mark. 
Ultimately, the SEC in April 2013 agreed with Mr Hastings that disclosure over major open social media sites could constitute public disclosure — as long as investors have been alerted to what social media will be used to disseminate the information.
“One set of shareholders should not be able to get a jump on other shareholders just because the company is selectively disclosing important information,” George Canellos, then-acting director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement at the time. “Most social media are perfectly suitable methods for communicating with investors, but not if the access is restricted or if investors don’t know that’s where they need to turn to get the latest news.”
While Mr Hastings and Netflix hadn’t previously disclosed that market-sensitive information might appear on the CEO’s Facebook page, the SEC said that there was enough “uncertainty” around the practice that it decided not to pursue any enforcement action against Mr Hastings.
Turning to Mr Musk, the Tesla founder has over 22m followers on Twitter, and given his active presence on the social media site — and proclivity to tweet out potentially market-sensitive information — the car company could have a good case to argue that a tweet does not fall foul of RegFD.

The tie-up with the US satellite radio broadcaster will promote material from the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Amy Schumer, Aziz Ansari and Sarah Silverman, who have all produced stand-up comedy shows for Netflix in the past. The new full-time channel is expected to go live in January 2019, the two companies said on Wednesday. 
The deal marks the first time that Netflix has joined forces with another subscription-based media company and will be its first foray into radio. 
However, for now at least, the move has been couched more as a promotional vehicle for Netflix than a strategic shift. Sirius XM gives Netflix a way to reach customers in the one place they can’t watch its shows - in the car. 
Netflix has strayed from video into audio before - through podcasts. 
In April, it launched a podcast series, You Can’t Make This Up, going behind the scenes of its original documentaries, including Wild Wild Country and its Oscar-winning film Icarus. Wormwood, a documentary series by filmmaker Errol Morris exploring the death of a CIA scientist in the 1950s, was given its own companion podcast mini-series last year. 
On the same day as announcing the Sirius deal, Netflix also unveiled a redesign of its big-screen TV app - where most of its subscribers spend the bulk of their viewing time. The new interface, which starts rolling out on Wednesday, adds a sidebar that makes it easier to search between movies and TV series, as well as a shortcut to shows that viewers have saved for later on “My List”. 
Netflix shares have had a wild, wild ride this week, plunging as much as 13 per cent on Tuesday morning after it missed its own subscriber forecasts. After briefly losing its position as the world’s most valuable media group to Walt Disney, Netflix stock rallied later on Tuesday and the two companies’ market caps were neck-and-neck by Wednesday lunchtime at around $165bn.

The company, whose shares had more than doubled in the year to date, opened 13 per cent lower on Tuesday, initially wiping as much as $20bn off its valuation, before recovering some ground. 
Netflix’s stunning rally came to a halt after it missed its own subscriber forecasts on Monday afternoon. The early stock drop was Netflix’s biggest since its last serious disappointment on subscriber numbers in July 2016.
Netflix’s market capitalisation fell below $150bn at the opening of trading, compared with Disney’s $166bn, before bouncing back above its rival. Netflix’s valuation surpassed that of the home of Mickey Mouse, Star Wars and Marvel’s Avengers in May. Disney is preparing to launch its own Netflix rival next year. 
Netflix reported worse than expected subscriber growth for both its international and domestic markets in the second quarter and cut its estimates for third-quarter growth, despite ramping up spending on marketing over the past year. 
Reed Hastings, chief executive, insisted in an analyst Q&A session on Monday afternoon that the company’s “fundamentals have never been stronger”, with viewing setting new records. Executives blamed their own forecasting errors for the subscriber shortfall, which was not concentrated in any one part of the world. 
In a note on Tuesday, analysts at UBS warned investors that “bingeing Netflix requires digestion”. The shortfall marked a “clear break from recent business model momentum”, after four straight quarters of exceeding its forecasts, UBS said. 
William Power, analyst at Baird, noted that Netflix had quickly returned to form after its last significant subscriber shortfall two years ago. “Overall, we suspect the miss is more of a blip than a significant change to the broader growth opportunity,” he said, sympathising with the company’s “forecasting challenges . . . given the many moving pieces in 100-plus countries”. 
John Janedis of Jefferies added that “while there was no single source of the weaker results”, neither was there a “breakout hit during the quarter”, despite debuts of new seasons of Marvel superhero series Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, and controversial teen drama 13 Reasons Why. 
Some analysts questioned why a near-doubling of Netflix’s marketing spend in the first half of the year had not yielded better results, while the company’s ability to raise prices might be curtailed given increasing competition from Disney and HBO, now part of AT&T. “It is what it is,” Mr Hastings said of the new competition, adding that Netflix would focus on improving its content, user interface and marketing. 
Other observers suggested Netflix would have to raise prices to offset the slower growth. 
“The real question is how long investors will be willing to be patient with Netflix’s losses in original content spending, especially in light of the growing competitive environment,” said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies. “It helps when investors believe the company has little to no real competition. Perhaps that was a belief of Netflix a few years ago, but I don’t think that is a safe assumption any longer.”

Facebook shares climbed as much as 1 per cent to an all-time high of $209.34 while Google-parent Alphabet rose as much as 1.9 per cent to $1,218.76 per cent. 
Amazon, the third of the original quartet, rose as much as 1.6 per cent to $185.69, leaving shares up 58 per cent so far this year. The advance in shares of Jeff Bezos’ ecommerce juggernaut came despite the embarrassing technical glitch the US website suffered at its 36-hour global discount event dubbed ‘Prime Day’ on Monday and strikes by its workers in Germany on Tuesday. 
Netflix was the main outlier falling as much as 14.1 per cent — after saying its quarterly net new subscribers fell 1m shy of analysts estimates before — clawing back those losses to trade about 6 per cent lower. 
Despite the sell-off in the streaming site the Nasdaq Composite scaled new highs rising 0.7 per cent to 7,863.06. The broader NYSE Fang+Index that includes Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Twitter, Baidu and Alibaba however failed to match that feat but was up 0.8 per cent on the day.

https://www.ft.com/content/e76910eb-a786-3437-850d-c492cca44aa5,Alexandra Scaggs,The Netflix dilemma -- updated,2018-07-17,12:10:47,"Netflix, the ever-churning content flywheel, reported subscriber growth of 5.2m in the second quarter, below its own forecasts of 6.2m. 
This led to a slide of more than 10 per cent in its share price: 
Its bonds fared a bit better, but still fell:
This backs up the idea that platforms get their equity value from user numbers, not profits or revenues. Indeed, Netflix's second-quarter user growth was 16 per cent lower than expected, and shares fell nearly 15 per cent in after-hours trading, almost in line with the user shortfall. 
And because Netflix needs to grow its user numbers to improve its valuation, it faces the same dilemma as any content platform: a trade-off between the quality of its content and the quantity of its users.
This tradeoff is glossed over in a recent series of posts about the company on REDEF, an aggregation site of “interest remixes”. The latest argues that “ Netflix isn't being reckless, it's just playing a game no one else dares”. The name of that game is monopoly, according to author Matthew Ball, former head of strategy at Amazon Studios: 
In short, he says the streaming company wants to replace television altogether: “The company doesn’t want to be a leader in video, or even the leader in video – it wants to monopolize the consumption of video; to become TV.”
Succeeding in that goal requires providing content for everyone, from the career television snob to the medical assistant seeking to unwind after a long day of work. If Netflix is indeed set on developing and producing most of its own content, it is not clear it can succeed in reaching all of those markets at once.
The issue is quality. While programming in the US has gone through a bit of a renaissance, and high-quality shows do seem to find more commercial success now, let's level here: most of those quality shows are not developed by Netflix. 
While we will not begrudge anyone their go-to costume drama or ultraviolent science fiction, the best television shows in recent years have been financed and developed by networks on the fringes of popular programming: Atlanta on FX, Counterpart on Starz, and Mr Robot on -- however improbably -- USA. 
It is interesting that Ball is a former Amazon employee, because all of these shows can be found on Amazon's video-streaming platform, and none of them are carried by Netflix.
Even Babylon Berlin, Netflix's ambitious period drama about Weimar Germany, was not developed or produced by the streaming platform, but by a collection of European production companies and Sky, the UK television network.
That backs up the argument that Netflix cannot be all things to all people, especially because it develops and produces most of its programming in-house. If it needs to hit a viewership home run with each of its original programs, it cannot afford to take a risk on “ Twin Peaks with rappers” -- instead it will go with the safer bet, which is more Twin Peaks. 
It can be argued that the rise of prestige television would not have happened without the internet's fragmentation of consumption. Such programming is by its nature challenging and not widely accessible, and requires consumers who have enough insulation from the daily stressors of life that they can afford to spend their leisure time thinking about its existential tensions. 
Lest we forget, even today, the most popular show in the US is 'The Big Bang Theory,' which has a plotline banal enough to “ turn [one] off from the ^%$*&$^ situation comedies altogether.”
HBO understands this. Amazon understands this. Netflix might understand this -- but if it does, it seems to want to become the new CBS, not the new HBO. And if it cannot develop both mass-market hits and more artful fare, it will not be able to replace television entirely. (Not without buying more content from networks, at least.)
In fact, a note published by UBS last week argues that it is not slowing subscriber growth that is the problem, but declining engagement: 
UBS downgraded the shares to neutral and cut their price target to $375 from $425 raised their price target to $425 before the results. From the note: 
They have since cut their price target to $360, calling the earnings report a “clear break from recent business model momentum”. 
It may be the case that Netflix has decided to re-focus on movies, as it says it has original films with Martin Scorsese and Michael Bay in the works. But movies require a bigger initial time commitment from the viewer, and they are not bingeable in the same way as, say, a sci-fi spy drama that doubles as a Cold War allegory and a deeper interrogation of human nature. 
The winner may in fact receive the spoils, as Ball argues -- but without better content, it is not clear the winner will be Netflix.

With that noir flourish, stylistically familiar to audiences worldwide from hit shows such as House of Cards or Narcos, Netflix this month launched its first ever Indian-produced series, Sacred Games. 
The show, based on the 2007 novel by Vikram Chandra, is an eight-part multimillion-dollar thriller set in the Mumbai criminal underworld, and featuring Hindi film stars Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte. But more than that, it is a statement of intent. Netflix, the streaming service with 125m global subscribers, views India as its next major source of revenue growth, not least because the country’s number of internet users has doubled in the past four years to 500m.
“Even we couldn’t have predicted the last two years of Indian internet growth,” Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, told a conference in Delhi this year. Talking about how the company had reached 125m subscribers, he added: “The next 100m is from India.”
Mr Hastings’s optimism reflects a mood among many western executives that after several false dawns this might be India’s moment. The country’s gross domestic product is growing at 7.7 per cent a year — faster than any other major economy — and while many think growth should be even higher, it boasts both a young population and a prime minister in Narendra Modi who wants to encourage foreign capital. 
Consumer companies are keen to reap the rewards of India’s emerging middle class. Amazon has pledged to spend $5bn trying to become the country’s biggest online retailer. Its main challenger is Walmart, which this year made India’s biggest ever direct foreign investment with the $16bn takeover of Flipkart. Ikea is set to open its first megastore in the country next month.
“Not only is India large but it is growing so quickly,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, said the day after completing the Flipkart deal. “The middle-income progress that is being made in urban centres and rural areas is very exciting for us.”
But as many corporate rivals could tell both Mr McMillon and Mr Hastings, investing in India requires boundless patience and deep pockets, and even then may well be doomed to failure.
Not only are there the usual pitfalls of stifling bureaucracy, widespread corruption and unpredictable policy changes, but experts warn that many western companies misjudge their target market in India — especially when it comes to the so-called “middle class”.
Devdutt Pattanaik, a former executive at Mumbai-based Future Group, the retail conglomerate, says: “Western companies visualise the Indian ‘middle class’ as they view the western ‘middle class’, whereas in fact only the rich in India can afford most of the middle-class lifestyles of western cities.”
Netflix entered India in a blaze of promotion and with a bag full of cash. Advertisements for Sacred Games are plastered over the Delhi metro and close to the airport. Its executives speak with a familiar zeal about the potential of the Indian market — like many western companies it has been shut out of China and hopes India will help make up for the lost growth opportunity.
“We are carried away with enthusiasm by India,” says Todd Yellin, vice-president of product at Netflix. “We think it will be one of our biggest sources of growth over the next few years.” 
The company believes that India, where audiences are used to lavish Bollywood film productions but mainly watch low-budget soap operas on television, is a vast untapped market for its brand of glossy, highly produced shows.
In its attempt to crack that market, Netflix is pursuing the same strategy that has earned it a $180bn valuation even before it makes a profit: spending big on original content in a variety of genres, and making the customer pay. 
Alongside Sacred Games, it has made a collection of short films about sex under the title Lust Stories, and next month will release a horror series entitled Ghoul. And if anyone doubted its ambition, it recently announced a plan to turn Midnight’s Children, Salman Rushdie’s sprawling novel about India’s transition to independence, into a series.
The company has always been reluctant to disclose financial or viewing figures. But Anurag Kashyap, who co-directed Sacred Games, told the Financial Times he was given a budget equal to what he would spend on one of his films. His 2013 film Bombay Velvet cost $13m.
Recommended
“Indian television would not risk itself with this,” says Mr Kashyap. “National television channels want to appeal to everyone. That means there is no space for anything new and we would have to dumb it down.”
Netflix does not carry advertising. So to fund productions such as Sacred Games, it is charging Indian subscribers between Rs500 ($7) and Rs800 a month, roughly what its western subscribers pay. Amazon, as a comparison, charges Rs129 a month for its Prime service, which includes streaming. 
According to estimates by IHS Markit, a market research company, Amazon’s streaming service had 610,000 subscribers to Netflix’s 522,000 at the end of 2017. Hotstar, the market leader, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, has 1.6m. 
“We see this as a fairly broad product over time,” says Erik Barmack, Netflix’s vice-president of international original content. “A cinema ticket at a multiplex, combined with popcorn and travel, is equivalent to the price of a Netflix subscription per month.”

Profit before tax of Maruti Suzuki 2017-18: Rs110bn
Suzuki entered India in partnership with the local company Maruti a decade before the country’s markets began to open up significantly to foreign capital. The company sold 1.8m cars in India in the last financial year.
Western consumer companies that have had success in India have, unlike Netflix, usually appealed to the lower end of the market. Suzuki, for example, turned its low-cost Swift model into one of India’s most popular cars. The company made Rs110bn of pre-tax profits in the country in 2017-18, alongside its local partner Maruti — nearly four times what it made five years ago. India is now the Japanese company’s biggest market.
Hindustan Unilever, meanwhile, in which the global consumer goods company owns a 54 per cent stake, has also focused on selling high volumes of relatively low-priced items, such as its single-use pouches of shampoo and face cream. The company made Rs72.9bn in pre-tax profits in 2017-18 — up nearly 70 per cent in the past five years.
But for every success story there are examples of multinationals that have failed to crack India. Often, strict regulations, stifling bureaucracy and capricious rule changes have been to blame — in part a legacy of India’s historic antipathy towards global capitalism.
Entered market: 1995
Profit before tax of GM India Private: Not declared
GM’s presence in India has been a particularly bumpy ride. It has failed to capture more than a few per cent of the market with its Chevrolet brand, and suffered a high-profile embarrassment in 2013 when it had to recall 114,000 of its Tavera cars, citing issues with emissions.
Ikea, for example, announced in 2006 that it intended to open its first store in India, but then spent years trying in vain to persuade New Delhi to relax rules forbidding foreign companies from operating retail stores without a local partner. In 2009, it said it was abandoning the plans, but then revived them when the government eventually relented. Nearly 10 years later, it is finally about to open in the southern city of Hyderabad.
Meanwhile both Vodafone, the telecoms company, and Cairn, the British oil explorer, have been hit with retrospective tax claims for several billion pounds — which they have since spent years fruitlessly trying to appeal against.
The other big risk is that companies simply fail to understand who should be buying their products.

		partners, nine chief executives and more than $1bn in investment. Analysts say the company never produced the kind of cheap but heavily accessorised car that Indians really want.
And despite the fact that India is the third-biggest smartphone market in the world, Apple sold just 500,000 iPhones there in the first quarter of this year, according to Counterpoint Research — roughly the same as its sales in Malaysia or Mexico. Its iPhoneX costs about $1,500 in India — 20 times the cost of the cheapest Samsung. 
Jayanth Kolla, partner at the Bangalore-based business consultancy Convergence Catalyst, says: “Western companies often get the Indian market completely wrong — though it is a failure more often made by American companies than European ones. 
“American companies don’t seem to understand how fragmented and diverse India is,” he adds.
The problem for many companies wanting to sell to Indian consumers — especially at the premium end like Netflix — is that while the country’s middle-class is growing, it has nothing like the spending power of its western equivalent.

		 In China, often touted as the model for Indian development, it was more than double that.
Economists Sandhya Krishnan and Neeraj Hatekar last year defined the “new Indian middle class” as those spending between $2 and $10 a day, some 600m people. Their French counterparts Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty calculated that to qualify among the top 10 per cent of earners in 2015, a person would have had to make around $3,000 a year — roughly the salary for a highly sought after job as a domestic worker in an affluent city.
Entered market: 1931
Profit before tax of Hindustan Unilever 2017-18: Rs72.9bn
Unilever has carved out a position as one of India’s biggest consumer brands, leading the market with products such as its Fair & Lovely face creams. It captured market share by offering its products in cheap single-use pouches, but analysts say the company has found it difficult to sell those customers higher-value items.
“There are about 50m Indians that would be global middle-class,” says Jayant Sinha, India’s aviation minister and a former finance minister. “That means they can fly everywhere in the country, they can fly internationally, they own a car, they have a stable job.
“Then we have an Indian ‘middle class’ of about 200m-250m people who have a stable job but not a well-paying one. They have many of the things you would expect a middle-class person to have: a refrigerator, a motorcycle, a smartphone, etc . . . Thereafter we have about 500m people who would be aspiring middle-class. They would probably just have a motorcycle.”
This is the challenge facing consumer companies spending big in India. Amazon is attempting to capture the market by discounting heavily and hoping it can outlast the Walmart-controlled Flipkart in a prolonged price war. Ikea is hoping to entice shoppers to buy its furniture, which at first will be imported and therefore relatively expensive, by stocking 1,000 items at below Rs200, from lightbulbs to small rugs.
For Netflix, if Mr Hastings is right that its next 100m subscribers will come from India, the company must sell subscriptions not only to every single member of what Mr Sinha calls “India’s global middle class”, but a considerable portion of those on lower incomes.
“If Netflix is looking at the most affluent 25m Indians, then it is doing the right thing,” says Mr Kolla. “Those people have probably heard of Netflix and are able to spend what they are charging. But if they are looking at the bigger India — 1bn or so Indians — they have definitely, definitely got that wrong.”
For directors and producers such as Mr Kashyap — who have been given big budgets for films before, but never for the kind of series in which Netflix specialises — the freedom is liberating. However, even as he praises his new paymaster, he identifies a major hurdle that Netflix will face. “The problem,” he says, “is that India is a country where everyone likes everything free.”
Ikea’s new store in Hyderabad, which is due to open next month, will be unlike anything India has ever seen before. The size of a shopping centre, the outlet will employ 850 people and include a restaurant that can seat 1,000 people, making it one of India’s largest.
The strategy, says Patrik Antoni, the company’s deputy country manager, is to appeal to a broad range of incomes by selling cheaply-made domestic items alongside expensive imported furniture.
“Our goal is to reach out to all these people who normally would not take part in a shopping experience like Ikea,” he says. “We want them to come, so we’re creating an offering that is much more affordable at the lower range, and then maybe some products at the top that are a bit more expensive [than they would be elsewhere].”
But he admits that one of the company’s biggest challenges will be to avoid developing a reputation as a luxury brand. 
“We need to work on how we are perceived,” he says. “We need to make sure that we are not seen as this expensive foreign brand that comes into the market, because all other foreign brands have been expensive.”
But like many of his corporate rivals, Mr Antoni says India presents a unique opportunity for his company, despite a decade of delays in opening. “There will be hiccups for sure, but no one would say that India will be a less prosperous and positive society by 2035 than it is today. No one believes that.
 “For other countries, will they be better or worse in 15, 20 years? We don’t know. Take Europe as a market: will the kids of today be better off than we are? Maybe not.”

https://www.ft.com/content/5b2a0ede-892e-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340,Tim Bradshaw,Netflix shares tumble after subscriber growth misses forecasts,2018-07-16,20:22:40,"Netflix’s stunning stock-price rally came crashing to a halt on Monday after it reported 1m fewer subscribers than investors had expected. 
The video streaming company added 5.2m net new subscribers in the second quarter, instead of the 6.2m that its executives had predicted three months ago. It admitted its performance was “strong but not stellar”. 
Netflix missed targets both in the US, where subscribers were up by 0.7m, and overseas, up 4.5m, bringing its total membership to 130.1m. 
Until the abrupt reversal in fortunes, Netflix stock had more than doubled in value so far this year including having added more than $40bn in market capitalisation since April’s forecast-busting results. 
The latest miss on subscribers is its biggest disappointment in two years, and it sent its stock tumbling by as much as 14 per cent in after-hours trading. Investors wiped more than $20bn from its valuation in a matter of minutes as they fretted that the past year’s growth spurt might be running out of steam.
Netflix’s outlook for the third quarter was also more conservative than Wall Street had expected. It predicted 135.1m members at the end of September. Its forecast of 5m global net subscriber additions this quarter was below the 5.3m it added in the same quarter a year ago. 
Thanks to recent price increases and foreign exchange fluctuations, Netflix’s revenues were broadly in line with expectations at $3.9bn, as was net income of $384m. It forecast revenues to rise to $4.0bn in the next quarter, a little less than Wall Street’s consensus of $4.1bn, and said it expected net income to dip to $307m. 
In its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix blamed its own internal forecasting for the disappointment, rather than any change in demand for its services. For the last four quarters, Netflix has substantially beaten its own subscriber forecasts. 
The last quarter included new seasons of popular Netflix original shows such as Jessica Jones and Glow, while the next quarter is expected to see the return of longstanding hits House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. 
Netflix touted its strong showing in last week’s Emmy nominations, when it received the most nominations of any company or studio, ending the 17-year dominance of HBO.
$8bn vs $4bn
Amount earmarked by Netflix to spend on content in 2018 versus free cashflow
Netflix’s awards cabinet may be swelling but it has come at a cost of billions of dollars in content spending a year. Despite slower subscriber growth, the Silicon Valley-based media and technology group gave no indication that it would cut back its planned $8bn content budget this year. 
Netflix still anticipates free cash outflows of up to $4bn for 2018, adding that it would continue to finance its content spending through debt rather than tapping the equity markets.
Executives have insisted that investing in yet more new films and TV shows is vital to keep attracting and retaining subscribers, especially as it faces increasing competition for both talent and viewers from Walt Disney, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and the newly combined AT&T and Time Warner, which owns HBO. 
The latest report on Monday gave no indication that Netflix was changing its approach. 
“We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties to have attractive offerings,” Netflix said. “Our strategy is to simply keep improving, as we’ve been doing every year in the past.”
The company is increasingly looking to new markets around the world to sustain its growth. Earlier this month it released Sacred Games, its first original series in India. 
“After handily blowing away Street expectations on subs the last few years this is a clear speed bump for Netflix,” said Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights. “The international miss was most concerning given this is the linchpin to the core growth thesis for the coming years.”

		for a month, but medical-device maker Abiomed has already made a splash as the index’s top gainer during the first half of 2018. 
Abiomed — which was moved from the S&P MidCap 400 to replace Wyndham Worldwide in the benchmark S&P 500 starting May 31 — has risen 120 per cent in the first six months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
The Massachusetts-based company makes the Impella pump and other heart recovery and support technologies. During fiscal 2018, which ended March 31, revenues were up 33 per cent year-on-year to $593.7m, and it has guided for another 25 to 30 per cent gain in FY 2019. 
Among analysts, Abiomed has five “strong buy” ratings, four “buy”, two “hold” and no sells, with a mean price target of $418.33, according to Thomson Reuters data. That’s close to the $412.83 a share at which it was trading on Friday. 
Abiomed may not be a household name, yet, but its 2018 to-date run has put it above more recognisable names — including Netflix and Twitter — that make up the rest of the S&P 500’s top gainers in the first half of 2018. 
Netflix, which clocked in behind Abiomed with a 104 per cent gain, has been hovering in record territory this year as top-shelf original content offerings like Stranger Things, The Crown and Orange is the New Black have made it a major threat to traditional entertainment giants. 
Rounding out the top five gainers on the S&P 500 for the first half of 2018 are social media platform Twitter; up 82 per cent; travel and restaurant website TripAdvisor, up 63 per cent; insurer XL Group, up 59 per cent; and athletic apparel and gear maker Under Armour, up 58 per cent. 
On the flip side, Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands is the S&P 500’s biggest faller so far this year, down 38 per cent, followed by Arconic, down 36 per cent; Dentsply Sirona, down 33 per cent; Unum Group, down 32 per cent; and Brighthouse Financial, down 30 per cent. 
Year to date, the S&P 500 has notched a 2.35 per cent advance.

Discovery, the US group that owns Eurosport, and ProSiebenSat.1, the German media group, said they would build a subscription streaming service in Germany that integrates programming and digital services from the two companies. They have also invited German operators RTL, ARD and ZDF to join the venture. 
“The only market in the world that I’m aware of where broadcasters have come together to create a leading over-the-top product is the US with Hulu,” said JB Perrette, chief executive of Discovery Networks International, in a reference to the streaming service jointly owned by Walt Disney, Comcast, 21st Century Fox and Time Warner.
Collaboration in Europe was essential, he added. “This is the only way that broadcasters can own and control their destiny.” 
The new venture comes as Netflix continues to add viewers in international markets. It has more than 125m subscribers and its explosive growth has prompted a round of consolidation among big media groups, which are seeking to create global content offerings and operations. 
Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is the subject of a bidding war between Walt Disney and Comcast, while Sky is also being fought over by Fox and Comcast.
Max Conze, chief executive of ProSiebenSat.1, said the goal of the venture with Discovery was to get to 10m subscribers within 10 years. “We are putting very significant resources and investment with urgency into this effort,” he said.
Alexandar Vassilev, a former executive with Google and YouTube, will lead the joint-venture team while Mr Conze will head the board. Mr Perrette will represent Discovery on the board. 
The new venture will integrate ProSiebenSat.1’s 7TV and Maxdome digital services with Discovery’s Eurosport player. It will offer local programming, an advertiser-supported service and a premium tier with sports and movies. More than 200 people will work on the venture, which will launch in the first half of 2019, the companies said.
The deal is the latest move by Discovery into subscription streaming. It recently struck a 12-year deal worth $2bn with the PGA Tour to create a “Netflix of golf” digital service that would be available in every country outside the US.
Its new deal comes ahead of a planned streaming service from Walt Disney and follows that company’s recent US launch of a sports service from its ESPN sports channel.

Jonathan Friedland, who had been at the company for nearly seven years, announced his departure via Twitter on Friday afternoon. “Leaders have to be beyond reproach”, he tweeted, adding he “fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy.”
Media reports, citing sources at the company, said Mr Friedland used a racial slur in a meeting with Netflix staff.
In a follow-up tweet, Mr Friedland said: “I feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love and where I want everyone to feel included and appreciated. I feel honored to have built a brilliant and diverse global team and to have been part of our collective adventure.”
Netflix shares closed at a record high this week on a handful of share price target upgrades from analysts. The company’s market capitalisation has already more than doubled this year.

That is $100 higher than GBH’s previous price target, surpassing the $490 that analysts at Goldman Sachs assigned Netflix last week and representing a near 30 per cent premium to Netflix’s closing price on Monday. The move also helped shares in the streaming site behind hit original series like The Crown, Stranger Things and Mindhunter buck broader Wall Street pain and rise as much as 2.9 per cent to $401.60. 
GBH’s price target would imply a market cap of about $217.35bn for Netflix — compared with $173.5bn at present — and would put it just ahead of where Pfizer, Mastercard, Cisco and Boeing are sitting today.
“Our bullish thesis on Netflix is based on our belief that the company’s competitive moat, franchise appeal, ability to increase international streaming customers through 2020, and original content build out will translate into robust profitability and growth as the next phase of this story plays out over the coming year with $10 of earnings power by 2022,” said Daniel Ives at GBH Insights.
Mr Ives noted that the average Netflix user is already watching the streaming service for more than 10 hours a week, “nearly double its nearest competitors Amazon and Hulu which is closer to 5 hours per week, an eye-popping disparity” and added that despite competition, Netflix is in “a unique position of iron-like strength to grow its content and distribution tentacles over the next 12 to 18 months”. 
Netflix shares have continued to push deeper into record territory. Investors are betting on its growth prospects as it plans to spend more than $8bn on original content this year. Indeed, Reed Hastings’ company, which first disrupted DVD rentals like Blockbuster, has sparked a shake-up of the traditional media players 
Comcast has gatecrashed Walt Disney’s deal to buy 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets and Disney is now said to be readying an increased offer as Bob Iger seeks to challenge Netflix though a family-friendly entertainment service with Disney, Marvel and Pixar content, a sports-streaming service led by ESPN and Hulu for entertainment aimed at adults. 
Mr Ives noted that Comcast’s move has thrown a wrench into Mr Iger’s plan and is “ultimately a positive” for the streaming site, since Disney is “the most viable threat” to Netflix in the near term. 
“From Netflix’s perspective a bidding war and potentially a break-up up of some key assets to multiple bidders (Hulu front and centre, Sky) to navigate any regulatory hurdles would be a major win for Hastings & Co. not to have all these assets under one hood and especially under the control of Disney,” said Mr Ives.
Separately, on Tuesday, analysts at Piper Jaffray boosted their price target on Netflix to $420 up from $367 previously while reiterating their “overweight” recommendation, while analysts at Moness, Crespi and Hardt lifted their price target to $460 from $375 previously. 
Netflix shares are now up nearly 109 per cent so far this year.

		to have doubled so far in 2018. The other is Abiomed, which hit the milestone in mid-May.
Hard on Netflix’s heels is Twitter, with its shares at a three-year high and up more than 90 per cent so far in 2018.
At this time last year, Netflix’s shares were up 22.9 per cent, nearly half of the 55.1 per cent gain it posted for calendar 2017.
Netflix now has a market cap of $165.2bn, putting it just behind Citigroup, at $171.6bn and Merck, at $168.4bn. Its market cap recently surpassed that of Walt Disney, which weighs in at $158.1bn and is doubling down on its own streaming services in an effort to be a contender in the Netflix era.
Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analysts reiterated their “buy” rating on the stock and said the company would be cash flow-positive by 2022. The bank lifted its 12-month target price by $100 to $490, which is the highest on the Street.
Netflix’s average target price is $335.91, according to a Bloomberg survey of 46 analysts, more than half of whom rate it a buy.

The three broadcasters, together with Arqiva, which owns and operates the national transmitter network, have sealed a £125m, five-year deal to develop new services for Freeview, including an app that will allow viewers to watch programming from the broadcasters live and on demand.
Proponents of public service broadcasting hope the investment will lead to more collaboration between channels, including a Netflix-style service that aggregates all available content from the BBC, ITV and Channel 4.
Pressure is building on the three organisations to work more closely together in the face of competition from Netflix and Amazon, which have vastly greater spending power. Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator, recently called on them to “collaborate to compete”.
When competitors like Netflix are spending $8bn a year on content and $1bn a year on engineering, we need to think about what is good for the consumer and the creative industries
Carolyn McCall and Alex Mahon, the new chief executives of ITV and Channel 4, have also talked of the need to join forces in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
“When competitors like Netflix are spending $8bn a year on content and $1bn a year on engineering, we need to think about what is good for the consumer and the creative industries, and where we should work together to make sure those values of public service broadcasting are best served in the UK,” said Ms Mahon recently.
Channel 4 also is working with the BBC to lobby for the prominence of public service broadcasting content in the user interfaces and programme guides of new streaming services. 
“This new commitment from our shareholders is a major boost for UK viewers,” said Jonathan Thompson, chief executive of Digital UK, which runs the Freeview platform. Further collaboration between the broadcasters would “safeguard free-to-view TV” and “reinvent it for a new age of viewing”. 
As viewers “cut the cord” and cancel pricey pay-TV subscriptions, free-to-air terrestrial television has become increasingly important, with viewers taking Freeview alongside a subscription to Amazon or Netflix. Today, more than 11m homes use free-to-air terrestrial services — 1m more than in early 2016, according to BARB, the standard for TV measurement in the UK. 
Recommended
Pay-TV operators in the US and Europe are grappling with shifting audience trends and the move towards lower cost “skinny bundles” of channels. According to BARB, the number of homes with a Sky satellite subscription has fallen by 400,000 since early 2016 — although this has been offset by sales of its cheaper NOW TV package. 
Netflix has more than 125m subscribers worldwide, of which about 8m are in the UK, and recently passed Walt Disney as the world’s most valuable media company. Amazon has more than 100m subscribers worldwide to its Prime video service.

https://www.ft.com/content/240a3510-5f66-11e8-9334-2218e7146b04,Tim Bradshaw,Netflix passes Disney to become most valuable US media company,2018-05-24,15:30:38,"Netflix’s market capitalisation briefly surpassed that of the Walt Disney Co on Thursday, making the streaming service the most valuable media company in the US. 
The move marks a symbolic moment of transition, as a Silicon Valley company focused entirely on digital TV and movies is seen as more valuable by investors than one of the most famous names in Hollywood. 
After years of wary collaboration, the two companies are about to become head-on competitors. Disney is preparing to launch a new streaming service for TV and movies in the coming months, and said it would remove some of its content from Netflix when its current deals expire. In April, it launched ESPN+, a new sports-focused streaming service, in its first move to take its programming direct to consumers. 
The two companies’ values were just a few hundred million dollars apart on Thursday morning, as their share prices continued to fluctuate during intraday trading. At around 11am in New York, Netflix had climbed just over 1 per cent to $348.43, giving it a market capitalisation of $151.9bn. Disney, down 1 per cent, was worth $151.6bn. 
Netflix shares have added more than 70 per cent so far this year, bolstered by better than expected subscriber numbers and key content deals with former US president Barack Obama and top US TV creator Ryan Murphy. 
The streaming service had already closed at a new record high on Wednesday giving it a valuation above Comcast, as Netflix climbed 4 per cent on news of its multimillion-dollar deal with the Obamas. Comcast was down 1 per cent to a market capitalisation of $145bn on Thursday morning, after the cable operator and NBCUniversal parent said this week it was looking to take on Disney in a battle for Fox’s entertainment assets.

https://www.ft.com/content/51d10acc-5d14-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68,Tim Bradshaw,Obamas strike multiyear production deal with Netflix,2018-05-21,16:56:22,"Barack Obama and his wife Michelle have signed their first big media deal since leaving the White House with Netflix, bringing the former US president to the streaming service that produced American political drama House of Cards. 
It is the latest high-profile signing for Netflix after recent deals with Shonda Rhimes, who produced Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, and Glee creator Ryan Murphy. 
The Obamas have struck a “multiyear” agreement with Netflix that could include both scripted and unscripted series, documentaries and feature films, the company announced on Monday. The couple have formed a new production company, Higher Ground Productions, to create the shows. 
“We hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world,” Mr Obama said. 
Mrs Obama added: “Netflix’s unparalleled service is a natural fit for the kinds of stories we want to share, and we look forward to starting this exciting new partnership.” 
Netflix provides the couple with a platform to reach 125m people around the world. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said he was “incredibly proud” they had chosen to work with the Silicon Valley-based company. 
“Barack and Michelle Obama are among the world’s most respected and highly-recognised public figures and are uniquely positioned to discover and highlight stories of people who make a difference in their communities and strive to change the world for the better,” he said. 
It is unclear how overtly political the Obamas’ shows for Netflix will be. The New York Times reported on Monday that the former president has told associates he would not “wage a public campaign” against President Donald Trump or conservative broadcasters such as Fox News. 
In March, Netflix named to its board Susan Rice, the former UN ambassador and national security adviser under the Obama administration. The move angered some American right wingers, who called for a boycott of the streaming service. 
Netflix stock was trading 1.6 per cent higher on Monday after the Obama deal was announced. The company’s market capitalisation of $143bn is now just $12bn behind that of Walt Disney Company, America’s most valuable media group.

Michael C Hall of Dexter fame plays Tom, widowed father of two daughters, the eldest of whom, Jenny, is playing up in typical teenage fashion. He’s trying not to confront her about older boyfriend, Chris, 19, but reveals to Tom’s best mate Pete (an inscrutable Marc Warren) that he’s intercepting all her texts just in case. “People are entitled to their secrets,” objects Pete, giving fair warning of the multiplying motives to come. 
Nearby, the parents of Jenny’s friend Sia have planned a romantic getaway. “No parties!” growls her rough diamond dad Jojo (Nigel Lindsay) on his way out. Hardly has the car swung down the drive before the local dealer drops off, and droves of scantily clad drunken teens arrive, among them Chris and Jenny, neither of whom make it home that night. Chris’s dad is convinced his son’s merely gone off in a huff, but Tom is frantic with worry about his daughter, calling on his secret love interest, Sophie, a capable police detective (Amanda Abbington). Her colleague Emma, (Hannah Arterton), is new to this supposedly sleepy beat, and brings a tough metropolitan edge to the case of the missing girl. Meanwhile, far from the cops’ prying eyes, the amateurish disposal of a body brings a tone of nightmarish slapstick.

https://www.ft.com/content/801774be-43e9-11e8-803a-295c97e6fd0b,Matthew Garrahan,"Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief with a global vision",2018-04-20,18:17:05,"The dozens of teenage fans amassed outside a hotel in Rome this week might have been waiting for a glimpse of a visiting pop star or Hollywood actor. Instead, they were there for the stars of an original Spanish language Netflix series. Set in Barcelona, La Casa De Papel has made global stars of its cast, underscoring the impact of the streaming service on television viewing habits and tastes around the world. 
Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive, was also in Rome. While not subject to screams from adoring teenage fans he was very much the centre of attention. Netflix unveiled a big increase in European investment: the company will more than double its production spend in Europe to about $1bn this year, producing 100 programmes in 16 countries — a push that is attracting growing numbers of subscribers outside its core US market. 
At its quarterly results Netflix revealed that it had hit 125m subscribers with 69m of those now coming from outside the US — a number that exceeded analyst expectations and lifted its share price to a record high. Netflix now has a market value of $146bn, making it more valuable than GE, IBM and Nike and only slightly less valuable than Walt Disney. 
“We’re not valued as we are because of that 125m,” Mr Hastings told the Financial Times. He pointed to the 700m households that pay for television and fixed-line broadband around the world, excluding China, as well as the 2bn people that use YouTube — the inference being that there is a lot of market share for Netflix still to grab. 
He and Netflix have avoided the regulatory and political scrutiny experienced by his Silicon Valley compatriots at Google and Facebook (where Mr Hastings is a board member) mainly because Netflix does not need advertising and makes its money selling subscriptions. But he has been no less disruptive. 
Netflix, which he co-founded in 1997, has upended the market for video entertainment, moving from a licensing model, where it paid channels for the rights to their programmes, to becoming a fully-fledged producer of its own material with its own distribution network. It outbid traditional channels to buy shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror and introduced global audiences to on-demand viewing for a monthly price that does not require a costly cable or satellite subscription. This year it will produce 700 original titles, including hundreds of series and 80 full-length feature films — about four times an many as most Hollywood studios.
It has also been entirely global in its approach. Mr Hastings and his colleagues realised early on that the company needed to acquire all international rights to its series to free it from the limits that beset the traditional television market, where shows are produced in one country and then licensed to others. 
Born Wilmot Reed Hastings in Boston, he was raised on the US east coast, where his father worked for Richard Nixon’s administration as an attorney for the department of health, education and welfare. The younger Mr Hastings attended Bowdoin, a liberal arts college in Maine, where he studied maths, before specialising in computer science at Stanford. 
Science runs in the family: his paternal great-grandfather was Alfred Lee Loomis, a noted physicist who invented the Aberdeen chronograph, a device that measured ordnance muzzle velocity — and which would become widely used by the US navy during the second world war.
Netflix’s push into original production has turned it into one of the entertainment industry’s biggest players but its chief admits to not being very preoccupied with Tinseltown. “What’s in the back and front of my mind is sharing the world’s best content, whether that’s Japanese anime, Turkish telenovelas, the film noir of the Nordics,” he says. “I’ve never been very Hollywood-centric.”
This international outlook may be explained by the time he spent abroad as a young man, first at the University of Bath, where he studied as part of an exchange programme, and then the time he spent with the Peace Corps between his stints at Bowdoin and Stanford. “I was a volunteer right out of college and was in Swaziland for two and a half years at a rural high school teaching O-level maths,” he told the FT this week. “That gives you a [different] sense.”
Despite the company’s rocketing share price, the path to international streaming success has not all been plain sailing. Seven years ago Netflix said it would separate its streaming business from its original DVD-by-mail service, which would be renamed Qwikster. Mr Hastings revealed at the time that he shared the news with a friend while relaxing in a jacuzzi: “That’s awful,” the friend replied — an apt assessment, given that Netflix’s shares crashed.
The plan was hastily abandoned and its first hit in-house production, House of Cards, premiered a year later. This set in motion a global push that has launched Netflix’s valuation — and Mr Hastings own stake, now worth an estimated $4bn — into the stratosphere. 
“Change comes slowly and often with resistance,” Mr Hastings said, as the company unveiled its new European programming, ranging from The Rain, a Danish science fiction series, to The English Game, a drama about the invention of football written by Downton Abbey’s Julian Fellowes. “There are so many great stories around the world . . . we want to make them available to everybody.”

According to people briefed on the investment plans, the revised budget will be more than double that of last year. The company will expand both its English and foreign language offerings, with new dramas going into production in Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Poland, Turkey and the Netherlands. 
The sharp increase, which will almost double the number of European productions this year, will have repercussions for traditional broadcasters who are already grappling with how to attract and retain viewers in the face of growing competition from Netflix as well as other streaming players such as Amazon. 
The company said this week that international revenues would exceed US sales for the first time this quarter. Netflix expects to spend as much as $8bn on original and licensed content in 2018, with most of that spent in the US.
Netflix’s rapid expansion has already helped spark a wave of media mergers in the US and Europe as cable and satellite providers bulk up in order to lure back viewers who are increasingly “cutting the cable” and relying solely on streaming services for TV programming. 
AT&T aims to emulate Netflix’s global reach with its proposed acquisition of Time Warner — a deal that is being challenged by the US government — while Rupert Murdoch recently admitted his decision to sell the entertainment assets of his 21st Century Fox group to Walt Disney was due to his inability to compete with Netflix.
Recommended
Netflix shares hit new highs this week after its quarterly subscriber numbers topped 125m. Its market value hit $144bn, making it larger than General Electric and IBM, and only marginally smaller than Walt Disney. 
The company used a plush event at a villa in Rome to launch a slate of new series on Wednesday. Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes is writing a Netflix drama about the invention of football and movie star Idris Elba is producing and starring in a new comedy.
“Our belief is that great storytelling transcends borders,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer. The company was “committed to being a voice for European entertainment”, he added.
The company, one of the so-called “Faangs” — a group of tech stocks that includes Facebook and Google — has attempted to win over European governments sceptical of the inroads it has made against state broadcasters by touting the jobs it creates through its work in Europe. It said current productions in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were generating employment for more than 35,000 people.
Analysts have upgraded their price targets for Netflix, which has said it is targeting an international market of 700m broadband-enabled households. This figure excludes China, the only large market where Netflix does not operate, but includes 300m households in Europe, which is becoming an increasingly important market as the company attempts to sustain its rapid growth rate. 
“Higher global broadband penetration should increase Netflix’s addressable market, driving member growth and providing further opportunity,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote this week. 
More than 73m of Netflix subscribers come from outside the US, with the remainder based in its home market. 
“More investment in European productions is a welcome addition to the choice of content available to viewers,” said Jonathan Thompson, chief executive of Digital UK, which runs the UK’s free-to-air terrestrial TV network. “However, Netflix has a long way to go in matching the breadth and depth, and national relevance offered by UK broadcasters — particularly the public-service broadcasters.”

Certain members of a younger generation of hedge fund managers are increasingly appearing as if they have got his simple maxim back to front. David Einhorn, a well-followed investor, has been doggedly betting against the shares of high-flying technology stocks such as Amazon and Netflix. At the same time he made big bets on struggling value stocks, expressing his gaping disbelief each quarter in letters to his clients as their performance fails to match the painful losses on his shorts. 
Since 2015, when Mr Einhorn not only berated Netflix’s cash-burning business model but went so far as to insult the script writers of House of Cards, the online video company’s shares are up by an eye-popping 574 per cent. The value of SunEdison, a company Mr Einhorn pitched as one of his top investment ideas in a public presentation in late 2014 ended up going to zero after it filed for bankruptcy protection.

Netflix shares appear very expensive, valued at more than 10 times sales, but hedge fund managers who remain short must ask themselves is it really worth the pain trying to be a hero? They are meant to be paid to identify the most profitable investments for their clients, not to put money on the line for the sake of intellectual bragging rights.
Debate over whether shares in fast-growing but mostly profit-lacking companies, such as Netflix, are egregiously overvalued or not will continue to rage. But in a world where there are hundreds of far worse companies for short sellers to choose from, such as outright frauds or melting ice cubes, hedge fund cynics may finally decide there are easier ways to make money than by betting against Netflix.

The milestone comes as Reed Hastings, chief executive, suggested on Monday that Netflix’s business model meant it was “substantially inoculated” from the legal and regulatory battles that tech companies are increasingly facing around the world over issues such as data privacy.
“I’m very glad that we built the business not to be ad-supported [and] to be subscription,” Mr Hastings, who sits on Facebook’s board, said in an analyst interview.
He also pointed to the $10bn that Netflix plans to spend over the next year in content and marketing, compared with $1.3bn on technology. 
“Objectively we are much more of a media company, in that way, than pure tech,” he said. “Of course, we want to be great at both but again, we are really pretty different from the pure tech companies.”
Even as stocks such as Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon have come under pressure in recent weeks amid rising legal risks, Netflix has surged. Shares jumped more than 7 per cent in early trading on Tuesday to hit an all-time high. 
For the first quarter, the digital entertainment group posted net additional subscribers of 7.4m, compared with about 5m that most analysts were expecting, to reach a total of 125m members. 
There are so many competitors especially around the world. If we get lazy or slow we’ll get run over just like anybody else
Revenues were up 40 per cent to $3.7bn in the three months to March, the fastest quarterly year-on-year increase it has posted since introducing its online streaming service. Net income rose 63 per cent to $290m. 
The jump came from a combination of last year’s price rise, driving a 14 per cent increase in average selling price, coupled with faster than expected subscriber growth. The quarter saw the debut of new series including a second season of Marvel’s Jessica Jones and the splashy sci-fi drama Altered Carbon. 
Its revenue outlook for the second quarter was just ahead of Wall Street’s previous estimates at $3.9bn, with 6.2m net additional subscribers. 
International streaming revenues will hit $1.94bn in the second quarter, Netflix said in its outlook, compared with $1.9bn for the US. 
The Silicon Valley-based company already has more members overseas — international subscribers overtook the US in the second quarter of 2017 — but customers typically pay more in its most developed markets.
Recommended
A more global business also means a wider range of rivals, from traditional broadcasters to local streaming services. Netflix is producing original content in 17 different markets and expects an increasing number of those films and shows, such as the Brazilian sci-fi series 3%, to be viewed globally.
“There are so many competitors especially around the world,” Mr Hastings said. “If we get lazy or slow we’ll get run over just like anybody else.”
That would mean this year’s $8bn budget for TV shows and movies would continue to grow, he added. 
Observers lauded the company’s latest results, with analysts at Baird asking: “Can anything slow its subscriber momentum?”

		break-even until 2024, as it continues to invest heavily in content and marketing. Netflix’s cash outflows are expected to be as much as $4bn this year. 
Most analysts, however, are confident that investors will continue to stomach the losses so long as Netflix continues to increase membership. 
“Netflix’s programming win streak continues and it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors,” said Credit Suisse in a note. “Given the accelerated pace of subscriber additions, we believe the Street will continue to underwrite the investments.”
However, none of Netflix’s films will be up for an award at the Cannes Film Festival this year. The streaming service decided not to enter the awards because of a rule that, it said, means any film in competition at Cannes “cannot be watched on Netflix in France for the following three years”.
Ted Sarandos, Netflix content chief, denied that this would affect the company’s ability to attract talent or win bids for new films. 
Netflix gave 33 films a theatrical release last year at the same time as they appeared online, five of which were nominated for Academy Awards.
“It’s becoming more and more accepted as part of the distribution norm,” Mr Sarandos said. “Defining distribution by what room you see it in is not the business we want to be in.”

		complaint, which alleges the streaming company “rigged” a bonus scheme and issued “false and misleading” statements about it.
The lawsuit, brought by the City of Birmingham Relief and Retirement System, in Alabama, follows and cites a report by the Financial Times last July, that highlighted how Netflix executives were hitting their targets for millions of dollars in cash bonuses with almost uncanny accuracy.
Last July, Netflix attributed hitting the targets to “management skill”. Following the lawsuit on Wednesday, the company said: “We intend to respond to these claims at the appropriate time.” 
The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, named Reed Hastings, chief executive, and 13 other individuals as defendants, as well as the company itself. 
It said the directors “breached their fiduciary duties . . . by rigging Netflix officers’ bonus payments in order to guarantee that Netflix would pay more than $27m in unnecessary cash payments and by misleading Netflix investors about both the way in which executive compensation was calculated and the potential tax liability incurred”.
The shareholder bringing the complaint is not seeking damages beyond legal costs but has asked the court for a finding that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by violating federal securities and tax laws. The complaint said they should be required to reimburse damages sustained by Netflix and for them to return “all compensation and remuneration” paid “during the time that they were in breach of the fiduciary duties”.
In the FT article in July, tax experts and investors questioned whether the targets were really based on challenging performance goals. Under the prevailing US tax code, executive bonuses worth more than $1m could be deducted from corporate taxes only if “the outcome is substantially uncertain”. 
In December, Netflix said it would scrap the bonus plan in light of the tax reform by Republicans, which abolished the deductibility of performance bonuses. Instead, Netflix executives are now paid higher salaries.
While its profits and subscriber numbers often differ hugely from company forecasts, Netflix has a much better record of predicting streaming revenues once it knows the number of subscribers it has at the start of a quarter. Streaming revenues were used from 2015 as the metric in a bonus plan for three top executives: Neil Hunt, chief product officer until he left the company this month; Greg Peters, who led international development before succeeding Mr Hunt; and Ted Sarandos, chief content officer.
The three executives hit the target squarely in seven out of eight quarters between the beginning of 2015 and the end of 2016, never exceeding it, and missing by just one percentage point in the other quarter. 
In 2016, the overall revenue target of $8.276bn was exceeded by $12m, or 0.14 per cent. The near-perfect precision meant that, out of a target pool of $18.75m, the three men collected $18.7295m, according to regulatory filings. 
The City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System manages $1bn, according to its last annual report, but does not appear among Netflix’s top shareholders.

The people proved wrong are the doubters, those who like Barrons thought its valuation was ridiculous all the way back in August, about $160 ago. 
Today, the numbers represent boundless optimism: a dozen times the $12bn of revenues reported last year, 120 times the profits it is expected to generate in this one. Fast forward, and estimates from analysts prepared to put a finger in the air for 2021 average out to forecast revenues of $27bn. 
Are they, and the market, wrong?
Maybe it would be easier to share that confidence if Reed Hastings submitted to the sort of quarterly conference call suffered by less exalted chief executives, where questions from the crowd are allowed. The company prefers to pre-record polite conversation with chosen analysts. 
It might be easier to believe in the growth story if 48m American households weren't already signed up for the delights of Stranger Things, and marketing spend wasn't growing faster than sales. It will jump to $2bn this year, from $1.3bn in 2017, which suggests winning customers is getting harder even if, like Netflix, we believe 700m households around the world are potential customers.
Buying into the dream would be easier if the company weren't also competing with Amazon, HBO and, in the not too distant future, Disney. 
Spending of $8bn on content is planned for 2018. It would be easier to believe such costs were sustainable if the group wasn't funding itself through an accumulation of debt. That borrowing may be the part the market has overlooked, or even got wrong, but it makes Netflix the epitome of the boom we now enjoy.

		or free cash flow. Netflix had to find $0.5bn every quarter last year, on the latter basis. 
It borrows in the bond market to fund such spending, accumulating $6.5bn in debt, and likes to talk up a ratio of debt-to-market capitalisation as if it measures financial health rather than the weight of fairy dust sprinkled on the stock. 
The debt is rated junk, four notches below investment grade. Were credit markets to close, as they periodically do to weaker borrowers in moments of strife, Nextflix would be shut out. 
It has $2.8bn of cash on hand, and another $0.5bn credit line, so it could wait out any reluctance by investors to lend. Maturities are evenly spread into the future. 
There's a circularity to the confidence game though. On the way up free spending on TV stars, writers, and producers is treated like investment. Stock market fans buy into the story of conquest, while debt investors and rating agencies tell themselves subscriber growth will eventually take care of the lack of cash.
A broader market upset could break that spell. Forced to preserve cash, prompting a slowdown in the pace of growth, and investors might focus more on the burn rate and the company's substantial content

		 The group has $7.5bn of these on the balance sheet, and another $10bn of such commitments off it. 
In all, contractual commitments come to $28bn, according to this table in the recent 10-K filing:
On top of that are another $3bn to $5bn of estimated commitments for unknown titles in the next three years, for instance “traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown”. Those costs are largely expected to fall due in 2019 and 2020.
Of course, much of these obligations will come under operating costs, and Netflix can reasonably point to large content obligations elsewhere. At the end of last year Disney listed $48bn of commitments, almost all sports related for ESPN, out of $92bn of total commitments.
Set against their respective valuations, Netflix's obligations don't look so bad. With net debt it has an enterprise value of $147bn, to Disney's $182bn. 
Traditionalists, however, might prefer some harder numbers. The Mouse empire took in $55bn in sales last year, and produced $9bn of free cash flow. 
Focus on the Disney valuation, however, because it gets at the question of what Netflix investors are playing for. 
Imagine in a decade Netflix has grown such that it has $55bn in revenues. Also imagine it can grow subscription fees as if they were for a college education, even though it will compete against Amazon, iTunes, Spotify and whatever else comes along for entertainment spend. If the average household were to pay $15 per month, up from $9.43 today, Netflix will need 305m paying households to get there.
It could, sure. We can also argue about details of business structures, predictability of subscriptions and whether Netflix will still be growing. 
Yet, if it does everything right from here, what is the upside for enthusiastic shareholders? 
A decade of incredible growth would take Netflix to something like the size, heft and cultural influence of Disney today, which the market thinks is only about a quarter more valuable than the TV-streaming trailblazer. 
Those feel like the wrong odds.

The deal is Apple’s latest move to build out its content and services platform, coming just three months after it announced plans to acquire Shazam, the music recognition app, for around $400m.
First launched in 2010, Texture has been described as “Netflix for magazines”, as its $10-per-month subscription service provides unlimited access to more than 220 publications including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, National Geographic and Vogue. 
Its business model resembles Netflix rival Hulu, a video streaming co-owned by a consortium of traditional broadcasters. Texture is backed by six publishers including Condé Nast, Hearst and News Corp.

		group KKR. Terms of the Apple acquisition were not disclosed. 
“We’re excited Texture will join Apple, along with an impressive catalog of magazines from many of the world’s leading publishers,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software & Services. “We are committed to quality journalism from trusted sources and allowing magazines to keep producing beautifully designed and engaging stories for users.”
Texture will build on Apple’s existing News app, launched in 2015, which employs push notifications and email updates to alert users to articles from topics and publications they follow. 
John Loughlin, the Hearst veteran who is Texture’s chief executive, has described the service as an “antidote to the web”, where news is often free and frequently disorganised. He said on Monday: “We could not imagine a better home or future for the service.” 
Apple is pushing further into news publishing just as Facebook is pulling back. The social network said in January that changes to its newsfeed algorithm would show fewer updates from “brands and media” as it sought to boost posts from friends and family. The changes followed intense criticism of Facebook’s position as a gatekeeper of news, ranging from manipulation and “fake news” to promoting controversial or viral content at the expense of more meaningful and considered information. 
Apple’s approach to its News app relies as much on human editors as algorithms. Last year, Apple hired Lauren Kern, former executive editor of New York Magazine, to be the News app’s first “editor in chief” as it builds out a broader team of curators and editors.

President Obama and his wife Michelle could front debates or documentary-style shows, according to a person familiar with the negotiations, which were first reported by the New York Times. No deal has yet been agreed and the Obamas have also talked to other tech companies including Apple and Amazon about a potential content partnership, the NYT reported. A Netflix spokesperson declined to comment.
If Netflix does win the rights to a series with the Obamas, who command an international audience of millions on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, it would be the latest sign in the shifting power balance between internet streaming services and traditional broadcasters. 
On Sunday, Netflix won its first Oscar for a full-length movie for Icarus, a documentary about Russian doping in the Olympics. It has already lured high-profile TV talent including Shonda Rhimes, who produced Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, and Glee creator Ryan Murphy from broadcast networks. 
Netflix has said it will invest as much as $8bn in original content this year. Its shift from licensing TV shows and movies from other broadcasters into owning and producing its own content began in earnest with 2013’s release of House of Cards, a political drama set in Washington DC that sees the ruthless Frank Underwood lie and murder his way into the White House. 
For Mr Obama, Netflix’s 117m subscribers would provide a real platform to weigh in on world affairs. The former president, who left office just over a year ago, has continued to voice his opinion on American issues from gun control to healthcare reform but has largely stayed out of the spotlight since President Trump took office. 
Mr Obama has already appeared on Netflix this year, in the first episode of talk-show host David Letterman’s new series. The hour-long interview passed without a single mention of Donald Trump by name. 
Thursday evening’s report is not the first suggestion that Mr Obama could launch a new career in the media. After news site Mic reported in December 2016 that the outgoing president might launch his own media company, then White House communications director Jen Psaki said on Twitter that Mr Obama was “interested in the changing ways people consume info, but he has no plans to get into the media business after he leaves office”.

The stock ended the day up 4.6 per cent at $315, after briefly touching a fresh intraday high of $316.91. The move — which added the equivalent of $6bn to Netflix’s market value — takes the shares’ gains to over 64 per cent so far this year. Over the past 12 months, the stock has more than doubled in value, climbing more than 126 per cent and pushing the company’s market capitalisation to nearly $137bn. 
In a note to clients on Monday, analysts at UBS said Netflix’s heavy investment in original content and customer retention should allow it to strengthen its competitive advantage over its peers. 
“We believe Netflix’s core competencies in both content and technology should drive a virtuous circle of greater subs and increased viewing time, enabling higher Arpu and revenue, which will fuel content spending to attract even more subscribers, positioning Netflix to sustain its clear global leadership in the emerging online video subscription business,” said lead analyst Eric Sheridan. 
UBS raised its share price target on the stock to $345, 19 per cent higher from its previous target of $290. 
Mr Sheridan added that Netflix still have plenty of room to grow outside its key US market. 
“Out of the existing 700 million global broadband households ex China, Netflix has only penetrated ~17% in aggregate — while US penetration has reached ~60%, international (ex China) penetration remains only ~10%,” he said.
“Broadband penetration remains low in many of Netflix’s key markets while internet infrastructure is still being built (eg, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, India). With increasingly sophisticated and efficient wireless infrastructure worldwide, Netflix’s total addressable market could expand to digital video viewers from fixed broadband households. For context, YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly logged-in users and Facebook has 2bn MAUs.”

Carolyn McCall — the former high-profile easyJet boss now running the UK broadcaster — may know the feeling. On Wednesday, she negotiated London’s frozen South Bank to demonstrate that she can turn further away from “spot” advertising and faster towards original content. All she eschewed were the sequins. 
So how did the judges rate her strategic triple toe loop? They awarded it a 6.0, but not the perfect kind: a nasty 6 per cent fall in the share price.
On the surface, it seems they were worried about the impact of big production numbers on costs, and an advertising environment that shows little sign of thawing. Unusually, Dame Carolyn disclosed its next two year’s schedule costs and, at £1.06bn and £1.1bn, respectively, these were more than the City had been expecting — leading some to wonder whether the group is having to spend more to compete with pay-TV rivals, such as Netflix and Sky, in drama and sport. At the same time, she said net advertising revenue was only expected to grow 1 per cent this quarter — despite agencies suggesting growth of about 3 per cent.
Dame Carolyn might have expected more of a bouquet, given that she is arguably taking the right steps, and some of her figures do not look too bad.
Leaning further away from a broadcast TV spot-ad market as it continues its structural decline is the only sensible move. An 11 per cent increase in non-advertising revenues indicates success in executing it, too, and takes this income to 56 per cent of the group total. ITV Studios — the content business — has pulled off revenue growth of 13 per cent and already landed 60 per cent of its 2018 target. Online revenues rose 7 per cent.
Stopping short of special dividends also looks prudent, with a more detailed strategy yet to be choreographed — and provides scope for acquisitions, some suggest. 
Why the share price slide, then? Arguably, on fears that margins cannot stand up. With online competitors pushing up the price of original drama — Netflix’s The Crown cost £10m an hour compared with former terrestrial TV costs of £800,000 — ITV Studios falling margin is set to come under pressure. But additional investment will also be needed in technology and data if ITV is to compete with the more personalised, targeted advertising already being offered by rivals.
Dame Carolyn has carved out £15m-£20m for new property, online and data investments but noted these were “ongoing” and the data tranche only “initial”. If her strategic review decides more is needed, the only thing preventing margins slipping from 27 per cent to nearer 20 per cent may be a big recovery in spot ad revenue. ITV notes that this year sees England compete in the football World Cup. But is there really any more demand for watching highly paid people fall flat on their . . . 
If a mature company increases its headcount by 7 per cent in a year, what should happen to its operating profit and cash generation?
Assuming those new heads can bring in more money than they cost, and other expenses remain flat, you might expect the former to rise a little more and the latter to be maintained. You might not expect to see increases of 36 per cent and 41 per cent respectively. 
But that is exactly what

		wealth manager St James’s Place, established 1991, has just reported. 
This is partly a reflection of the operational efficiency built into its business over those years. A 7 per cent increase in the number of qualified financial advisers, to more than 3,600, was able to deliver a 20 per cent increase in funds under management, to £90bn, which in turn lifted investment and advice fee income. Partly as a result of this disparity, operating profit rose more than a third. Then, partly thanks to the operational effect, but also to contributions from pension products coming on to the books for the first time, cash generation increased even more.
However, the big increases in funds under management and efficiency arguably came after 2012. In that year, funds grew 6 per cent. In the next five they grew 22 per cent, 27 per cent, 17 per cent, 28 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. 
Another FTSE 100 financial services group shows a similar growth trajectory. In 2012, Hargreaves Lansdown’s assets under management rose 7 per cent. In the next five, they were up 38 per cent, 29 per cent, 18 per cent, 12 per cent and 28 per cent. 
What happened in 2013? Regulatory change drove thousands of commission-based independent financial advisers out of the market, leaving consumers with a choice of only fee-based wealth managers, such as St James’s Place, or online platforms, such as Hargreaves. Both have positioned themselves well to benefit from higher standards and transparency. But operational efficiency is so much easier to achieve when part of state-ordained duopoly.

Mr Murphy is the latest top producer to swap the traditional Hollywood studio system for the online streaming world after Netflix hired Shonda Rhimes, creator of Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, from Disney’s ABC last August. 
Netflix has committed a $300m budget to Ryan Murphy Productions over several years to produce TV series and films exclusively for its streaming service. 
The $300m figure, confirmed by a person familiar with the terms, puts it among the biggest TV production deals ever signed, estimates the Hollywood trade publication Deadline. 
The producer will be a loss for both Fox’s TV division and for Disney, which is in the process of acquiring the Fox unit. Just last week, Disney said it had signed the creators of HBO’s Game of Thrones to write and produce a series of Star Wars films, as it prepares to launch its own streaming service to rival Netflix. 
Though Netflix declined to comment on the terms, the deal shows the high dollar value that top Hollywood talent is able to command as tech companies vie with traditional media groups for exclusive programming, bidding up prices in the process. 
“Ryan Murphy’s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix. “His unfaltering dedication to excellence and to give voice to the under-represented, to showcase a unique perspective or just to shock the hell out of us, permeates his genre-shattering work.” 
At a time when Hollywood has come under greater scrutiny for sexual harassment, Mr Murphy hailed the deal as a win for diversity, thanking Netflix for “believing in me and the future of my company which will continue to champion women, minorities and LGBTQ heroes and heroines”. 
“The history of this moment is not lost on me,” he said. “I am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallised and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.”

Reading Ms McCord’s book Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility prompted the woman to cancel her company’s annual staff performance review. “Score one for Patty,” she says, emitting a loud, throaty laugh.
If it were up to Ms McCord, who joined Netflix in 1998 when it was a start-up, more companies would ditch their performance reviews, and other shibboleths such as signing bonuses, anonymous employee surveys and pay secrecy. She wants to shake up human resources, which has a reputation for being out of touch.
Bureaucracies have slowed down innovation
“You need to choose the practices rather than just do them because it has been done before,” she says. “The top-down hierarchical model doesn’t work any more,” she tells me over the phone from Texas, where she spent her childhood, though now she lives in California. “Bureaucracies have slowed down innovation.”
The 64-year-old writes as she speaks: bluntly. In the book she eschews the language of HR: “A business leader’s job is to create great teams that do amazing work on time. That’s it.” Out are the modish terms “employee engagement” and “empowerment”, which only get bandied around, she says, as workers lack power, and a belief that employees want entertainment rather than results. That is infantilising — and, as she likes to say, she is not “your mom”.
Netflix, which pivoted from DVD mailing company to streaming service and then to entertainment producer, has forged a reputation for producing high-quality on-demand programmes such as The Crown.
It is renowned for its organisational culture. Company perks include unlimited time off and an expense policy that is simply to “act in Netflix’s best interests”. That is the upside of the culture: treating workers like grown-ups. 
The flipside is intolerance of anything below high performance. Managers are expected to run the “keeper test” — that is, would a manager try hard to keep an employee from leaving? If not, they should ask them to leave with a pay-off. 
Ms McCord wrote Powerful as a “how-to for HR professionals”. After she left Netflix in 2012, she went hunting for human resources innovations. “I couldn’t find much,” she says. 
Instead, all anyone wanted to discuss was how to do the “Netflix deck” (see box below). “It took 10 years to write!” Ms McCord, who now advises blue-chip companies and entrepreneurs on culture and leadership, insists that Netflix’s culture cannot, and should not, be replicated wholesale by every company.
But surely HR policies honed over decades are there because they work? Ms McCord agrees, but only to a point.
She wants to prompt executives to interrogate “practices rather than just to do them because it has been done before”. They must also be alert to change. “You can’t keep a culture [as it was].” 
Predictably, Ms McCord argues HR should have greater influence. She says part of the reason for turmoil at Uber, the ride-hailing app, which was criticised last year for ignoring sexual harassment allegations, was because “HR couldn’t speak to Travis [Kalanick, the co-founder and then CEO].” Yet they need to up their game, she argues, by understanding the core operations of a business and its profit and loss statement.
The #MeToo movement has underlined the ineffectiveness of HR. While gratified to see women speaking up about harassment and hopeful about an end to the start-up “frat house” culture, Ms McCord worries HR’s image as the “evil mom” is being reinforced. 
Work is work . . . It’s not always a brilliant life-changing event every day
The book’s relentless focus on brilliant performance can be exhausting for the reader. Does every employee have to be a star, all the time? “Work is work,” she says. “It’s not always a brilliant life-changing event every day.” 
But she dismisses the idea that some jobs suit mediocre employees, recounting a conversation with a chief executive, who dared to make such a case. “I asked, ‘OK, who in your company doesn’t need to be brilliant? Like, which job?’” 
When he tentatively suggested payroll, she replied: “Not every position needs to be filled with Albert Einstein, but they need to be very good at what they do.”
On Glassdoor, the job review site, one Netflix employee writes it is “open knowledge that the company isn’t responsible for your career progression”. It is a view championed in Powerful: “We should not make false promises of job security,” writes Ms McCourt. If a good employee no longer fitted their role, Ms McCord says, she has helped them find a new one elsewhere. 
And so the end came for Ms McCord. In 2012, she got her own severance package. “It was time,” she reflects. “I left as Netflix transitioned to an international streaming model. It was a different phase that I wasn’t suited to . . . they were going into film. It wasn’t a surprise.” For someone who espouses radical honesty, she is touchy on the topic. Reporters, she hits back, are “obsessed with the break-up . . . Of course I was upset. Is life without Netflix unbearable? Hell, no.” 
In 2009, Netflix’s 124-page presentation on its workplace principles — or “freedom & responsibility deck”, as it became known — went viral when it was published online. Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook, said it “may well be the most important document ever to come out of [Silicon] Valley” — unusual for a PowerPoint presentation. An updated version was published last year at jobs.netflix.com/culture

HBO, home of hits Game of Thrones and Big Little Lies, reported on Thursday that 2017 had been its strongest year ever thanks to a revamped distribution model that makes its programming available wherever viewers want — whether or not they have cut the cord on cable and satellite subscriptions. 
The premium cable network added more than 5m US subscribers, shattering its previous subscription growth record by more than 1m and powering Time Warner’s profits. Time Warner shares rose more than 2 per cent on Thursday, hitting their highest levels since the justice department blocked its takeover by AT&T in November.
HBO’s record followed last week’s announcement from Netflix that it had signed up an unprecedented 8.3m in the fourth quarter, beating its previous guidance of 6.3m. The streaming pioneer forecast higher revenue and profit this year even as the streaming company raised its prices. Netflix shares are up more than 40 per cent this year.
The record growth from streaming comes as ratings have dropped across most traditional TV networks. This has begun to reshape the media landscape, prompting traditional media moguls like Rupert Murdoch to get out of cable entertainment altogether.
Walt Disney’s $66bn deal to buy most of the entertainment and international businesses of Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is aimed at beefing up its own direct-to-consumer offerings, which will compete with Netflix for subscribers.
For Mr Murdoch, the decision to sell cable networks including National Geographic and FX, is an acknowledgment that competing against the deep pockets of Netflix and Amazon requires far greater scale than Fox currently wields. 
HBO has been one of the few traditional television companies to buck the trend. As a premium add-on to pay-TV packages, it has been less susceptible to cord-cutting than other networks that are part of the core bundle of channels. 
But the company has moved aggressively to diversify its distribution channels beyond cable and satellite operators amid industry upheaval — including the attempted acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T, which management is still pursuing by challenging the DoJ’s opposition through the courts.
HBO’s subscription growth last year was fuelled both by the availability of its programming digitally and new pacts with traditional cable and satellite providers including Comcast, Charter and DirecTV.
Instead of raising prices for HBO, the company moved to a revenue-sharing model that gives distributors a larger share of subscriber fees the more HBO subscriptions they sell.
The swell of paying customers lifted HBO subscription revenues 11 per cent in 2017, the largest expansion in more than 20 years.
Subscriptions delivered outside the traditional pay-TV bundle now total more than 5m, up from 2m a year ago. HBO’s total global subscriber base stands at 142m. Netflix, in comparison, has 117.6m customers around the world.
Bolstered by HBO, Time Warner sales rose 7 per cent to $31.3bn, with additional help from increases at Turner, the home of CNN and TBS, and Warner Bros, where movie hits including Wonder Woman and Dunkirk contributed to more than $5bn in box-office receipts. Full-year net income surged 33 per cent to $5.24bn, or $6.64 a share.
In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 9 per cent to $8.6bn, beating Wall Street’s forecast of $8.4bn. Net income jumped to $1.39bn, or $1.75 a share, from $293m, or 37 cents a share, boosted by a benefit of $1.06 a share from the tax cuts.

		this year as investors welcomed a forecast-busting set of results and sent shares more than 10 per cent higher on Tuesday.
Shares were up 10.5 per cent in morning trade in New York on Tuesday, and had gained as much 13.2 per cent earlier in the session. It was the second-best performer in the benchmark S&P 500, behind a 17.7 per cent gain for ResMed.
That brought Netflix’s gain in 2018 to 30.9 per cent, making it the top stock in the S&P 500, and nearly five times the gain for the benchmark. At Monday’s close, before the release of its December quarter results, the stock was the index’s 10th-best performer.
Today’s share price jump pushed Netflix’s market capitalisation through $100bn for the first time, putting it ahead of the likes of Nike and Goldman Sachs, and just behind oilfield services company Schlumberger.
Last year, Netflix shares gained 56.4 per cent, while the S&P 500 rose 19.4 per cent.

https://www.ft.com/content/c97f0352-ffeb-11e7-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5,Tim Bradshaw,Netflix races to bolster content as former partners become rivals,2018-01-23,05:33:49,"When the first season of House of Cards made its debut on Netflix in February 2013, pundits wondered whether the video streaming service could really afford the $100m political drama. At the time, Netflix had 33.3m streaming subscribers, many of whom quickly became glued to the tale of Washington DC scheming and intrigue. 
Five years ago, original commissioning was a novelty for what was only a few years earlier known primarily as a DVD-by-mail business. Then, Netflix was heavily dependent on content distribution deals with traditional media groups including Walt Disney and Mad Men-maker AMC for the vast majority of its online library. 
Fast-forward to early 2018 and Netflix can afford to write off $39m without Wall Street even blinking. The $39m non-cash charge incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 was related to programming, including two episodes of House of Cards that Netflix commissioned but will never air due to the sexual harassment scandal that erupted around the show’s leading man, Kevin Spacey. 
That charge was reported alongside another forecast-busting set of results released on Monday that sent Netflix’s market capitalisation soaring above $100bn for the first time, sending shares up more than 10 per cent on Tuesday morning. 
Annual revenues jumped 32 per cent year-on-year to $11.7bn in 2017, while net income tripled to $559m, thanks to hit shows including Stranger Things, The Crown and 13 Reasons Why. 
“Given the big beat on subscribers in the quarter — especially for the domestic business, it is hard to argue with Netflix’s statement that they ‘had a beautiful quarter’,” said analysts MoffettNathanson. 
Tuesday morning also gave Netflix a preview of its most promising Academy Awards yet, as its movie Mudbound received four nominations — its first for a feature film. Other titles brought its nomination total to eight, up from just three last year. 
Yet as investors cheered Netflix’s accelerating growth to reach 117.6m subscribers globally, the company warned that maintaining its momentum in original content would come at an upfront cost that makes that initial $100m outlay look like a rounding error.

		from content pre-payment and debt have increased fourfold in the last five years. The combination of its long-term debt and streaming content obligations has swelled from $6.1bn at the end of 2012, when House of Cards was first commissioned, to $24.2bn at the end of last year. 
Of that total, $17.7bn is streaming content obligations — what it pays for the acquisition, licensing and production of television shows and movies, sometimes years in advance of broadcasting a show. The other $6.5bn is debt — and Netflix said on Monday that it planned to tap the bond markets again soon. 
Analysts at Jefferies said in a note to clients that expenses such as marketing spending and programming cost were “higher relative to our expectations”. 
To justify that $24bn of liabilities, chief executive Reed Hastings is asking investors to bet on Netflix’s success in producing hit shows as it races to fill the programming gap left by the likes of Disney turning from partner to competitor in the streaming market. 
“We’ve had that track record in the last couple of years at greater and greater scale,” Mr Hastings said in Monday’s quarterly analyst interview, which the company streamed on YouTube. “We are continuing to take it up a notch.” 
Many analysts agreed, with researchers at Bernstein saying that the results confirmed Netflix’s “flywheel is working brilliantly”, as more content drives more subscribers which fuels further programming investment. 
“Content and marketing investment is working better than anticipated — so the indicated action is: press the gas pedal,” Bernstein’s Todd Juenger wrote in a note on Tuesday. “Spending more, faster is ironically the less risky path, since the most important key to long-term success is extending the scale advantage as wide and fast as possible.”
Netflix executives touted the upcoming launches of Altered Carbon, a science-fiction show, and Everything Sucks, a coming-of-age comedy-drama set in 1990s Oregon, as examples of shows that would continue to attract new subscribers in 2018. 
The company also plans to commission more programming in languages other than English, from just a handful of shows last year such as Germany’s Dark to more than 30 international “originals” in 2018, from producers in Poland, South Korea and Japan. Alongside that are dozens more full-length movies, after the Will Smith blockbuster Bright proved a hit with viewers last month. 
In total, Netflix plans to invest as much as $8bn in new content this year — and Mr Hastings warned that the budget would continue to grow. 
“It will definitely of course be higher in 2019 and 2020,” he said of Netflix’s content costs. “Don’t think of $8bn as some new plateau.” 
Competition, too, is increasing. Disney is planning to launch new subscription streaming services starting later this year and Hulu, the US internet video service that is jointly owned by Disney, Fox and Comcast, grew to 17m subscribers last year. 
Anticipation of that competition from traditional media companies was what drove Netflix to invest in its own TV shows in the first place, according to content chief Ted Sarandos. 
“We have strategically and they have strategically been moving in this direction for a long time,” he said on Monday. “One of the reasons that we entered into original programming was that if we got to the place where networks didn’t want to sell us their content in second [distribution] windows that we would be replacing that by creating our own original programming. And it’s playing out in that direction.”
Mr Sarandos added that many Netflix shows that are licensed from or made by Disney, such as Marvel spin-offs Jessica Jones and The Punisher, are locked into long-term deals. “As long as they keep making those shows, they continue on Netflix,” he said.
If Mr Hastings was concerned about the impact of Disney’s $66bn plan to buy 21st Century Fox’s entertainment businesses, he did a good job of hiding it when he was quizzed by analysts about it for the first time on Monday. 
“These kind of big US media company mergers are pretty peripheral to us,” he said. “I was as surprised as anyone else that Fox was willing to sell”. 
Yet even though Rupert Murdoch has suggested that the competitive threat from Netflix contributed to his decision to sell Fox to Disney, Mr Hastings said he was looking forward to the new streaming services that would follow the deal — as a viewer, at least. 
“Disney, with its strength of brand and unique content, will have some real success,” the Netflix chief said. “I know I'll be a subscriber of it for my own personal watching.”

However, Netflix warned that free cash outflows could reach $4bn in 2018, double the $2bn in cash outflows it reported for last year, as it ploughs more money into content commissioning that may not reach screens for up to three years. That will send Netflix returning to the debt markets to raise capital, it said. 
Price hikes in several key markets in October did not prevent Netflix from adding 1.98m subscribers in the US and 6.36m in the rest of the world to take its total for the fourth quarter to 117.6m — about 2m ahead of Wall Street’s estimates.

		were in-line with analysts’ expectations at 41 cents. 
The price increases mean that Netflix is now forecasting higher profits in the first quarter, after average selling prices increased by 9 per cent in the last quarter. 
Net income is likely to jump 51 per cent $282m and operating margins are increasing from 7.5 per cent to 9.8 per cent in the first three months of 2018, the Silicon Valley-based company said. Netflix’s first-quarter revenue forecast of $3.69bn, up 40 per cent year-on-year, is also better than analysts had predicted, with subscribers growing by another 6.35m to 124m globally. 
2017 was the first year that Netflix’s international business recorded a profit contribution. 
Because Netflix is growing audiences faster than it expected, it warned shareholders to brace for even greater investment in content. 
“We are increasing operating margins and expect that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend will turn our business [free cash flow] positive,” Netflix said, adding: “We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market . . . High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick.”

The streaming service said in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday that it took a $39m non-cash charge for “unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with”. 
The figure provides a hint of how much the wave of scandals that followed allegations of sexual harassment against top producer Harvey Weinstein last year might cost Hollywood. Mr Spacey has denied many of the allegations.
According to a person familiar with the matter, Netflix’s entire $39m write-off was related to productions that had been shot but not aired starring Mr Spacey, who was first accused in October of making unwanted advances and inappropriate conduct towards several people over many years. 
The cancelled projects were two episodes of House of Cards, the long-running political drama in which Mr Spacey starred as anti-hero Frank Underwood, and a biopic movie, Gore, in which he played the titular writer Gore Vidal. The movie, which was based on the 2015 Vidal biography Empire of Self and was in post-production when Netflix pulled the plug, had been slated for release this year. 
In November, Netflix said it would cut ties with Mr Spacey and end House of Cards after the forthcoming sixth season, after suspending production after members of the show’s crew accused the actor of inappropriate touching. 
House of Cards was among the first of Netflix’s original series to debut and helped cement its reputation as a new creative force in Hollywood. Netflix said on Monday it will spend up to $8bn on original content this year.

Netflix shares are up 1.4 per cent to a new all-time high of $208.73 on Friday after the video-streaming service announced a January 12 premier date for the new show from longtime talk-show host and comedian David Letterman, as well as its first guest — Barack Obama, the former US president.
In a tweet, Netflix announced other high-profile guests for the show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman, including rapper Jay-Z, radio personality Howard Stern, comedy star Tina Fey, activist Malala Yousafzai and actor George Clooney.
The show will differ from Netflix’s usual binge-able original content in that new episodes will be released once a month, rather than all at once. Nevertheless, Wall Street seems to be buying the hype, along with fans eager to see Mr Letterman — who spent several decades as one of the top late-night TV hosts before retiring from the small screen in 2015 — back in action.

Netflix’s American audience is approaching the size of the entire US pay-TV market, according to a new survey by PwC, while separate research by IHS Markit suggests the maker of Stranger Things and House of Cards is widening its lead over Hulu in paying subscribers. 
The findings point to the scale of the challenge facing Walt Disney in the fight to win new subscribers. After its planned $66bn takeover of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment businesses it will become Hulu’s majority owner, as US cable subscriptions continue to ebb. 
Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney, said last week on a conference call announcing its bid for Fox that creating direct-to-consumer streaming services is “vital” to its future and his “highest priority”.
He said Hulu would be a “more adult-oriented product” than the family-friendly Disney-branded streaming service planned for launch in 2019, when the first phase of its current content licensing deal with Netflix expires. 
Disney and Fox are currently joint owners of Los Angeles-based Hulu alongside Comcast’s NBC unit. The three each have an equal stake; Time Warner bought 10 per cent of Hulu last year. 
“Owning roughly a third of it was great, but having control of it will enable us to greatly accelerate Hulu into that [direct-to-consumer] space and become an even more viable competitor to those that are already out there,” Mr Iger said. 
Market researchers suggest Disney and Hulu have a long way to close the gap with the industry’s leader, Netflix. 
Analyst group IHS predicts Netflix will increase its US subscribers to 54m by the end of this year, increasing its lead over Hulu from 33m a year ago to 37m. Hulu does not disclose its paid subscriber numbers but IHS’s estimates are higher than others in the industry at 17m. 
Other studies also point to Netflix’s growing stranglehold on the market for online video. A survey of about 2,000 Americans in October by PwC found that 73 per cent of respondents subscribe to pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, while 73 per cent also subscribe to Netflix. 
Netflix reported 53m domestic streaming customers at the end of the last quarter, which is still significantly behind IHS’s calculation that total pay-TV homes stand at roughly 95m. 
The discrepancy between the reported figures and PwC’s survey responses may reflect the extent of password-sharing among Netflix customers. 
Hulu was launched 10 years ago as Hollywood’s response to the growth of YouTube. In recent years, it has become the traditional media industry’s best hope against Netflix and Amazon, which are investing billions of dollars to produce their own content and reduce their dependence on Hollywood. 
“Hulu historically has tracked the major strategic worries of its corporate parents,” said Dan Cryan, research director at IHS Markit. “To grow that business going forward, it is going to need a clear point of differentiation. What is not entirely clear is where that comes from.” 
To grow [Hulu] going forward, it is going to need a clear point of differentiation. What is not entirely clear is where that comes from
Hulu has been best known as a way to catch up on broadcast TV shows that viewers missed, Mr Cryan said, but other US media companies such as NBC and CBS are increasingly building their own standalone apps. 
Mr Iger said he believes Hulu’s differentiation will come from Disney and Fox’s shows, which are being pulled from rival platforms, as well as Hulu’s own original programming, such as its Emmy Award-winning The Handmaid’s Tale. 
“Hulu has been increasing its investment in original programming and in licensed programming,” Mr Iger said last week. “If we decide to increase our spending on original content at Hulu, we certainly have the intellectual property-creating capabilities far more than we did before this acquisition.”
Disney is also planning a standalone streaming service for ESPN, its sports network. 
PwC’s study found live sports on cable and satellite are still the main reason preventing most consumers from cutting the cord, with 82 per cent of sports fans saying they would end or trim back their pay-TV services if they could watch the game online. 
However, hopes in the traditional media industry that consumers will replace their cable and satellite subscriptions with an array of streaming services and online channels may be overly optimistic. Most “cord cutters” and “cord nevers” — youngsters who have never signed up for traditional pay-TV — regularly watch just two services.

The title comes from WB Yeats’s foreboding poem “The Second Coming”, which also gave Didion the title of her book of caustic essays, Slouching Towards Bethlehem. 
Dunne’s film excels at giving a sense of Didion’s careful, reserved personality. Slouching was born of her feeling out of joint with the hedonistic 1960s, as though everything she thought she knew was melting into uncertainty. There’s marvellous archive footage of her early years as a journalist and classy commentator on America, writing cerebral pieces for a perhaps somewhat surprised US Vogue readership. Didion married the writer John Gregory Dunne and moved to California, where she cut a chic, Jackie O-style figure in huge sunglasses with ever-present cigarette, turning out intricately wrought novels and journalism.
Dunne’s approach to the story is rather oblique. Didion’s coverage of the Manson Family trial needs no editorial gloss, but details of the Central Park jogger case are less well-known. Family holiday photos are especially poignant when they feature Griffin’s sister Dominique, who was murdered at 22. Didion and her husband adopted a daughter, Quintana, and the mood of the film, always sombre, plummets further with the circumstances surrounding Didion’s most famous book, The Year of Magical Thinking, a memoir about grief and bereavement. There are hints that the Didion-Dunne marriage was uneasy, and a stray reference to Quintana’s problems with alcohol, but Griffin tempers intimate family access with reticence. While occasionally frustrating, this seems appropriate: Didion herself faces triumph and despair alike with a resolute and unblinking fortitude.

https://www.ft.com/content/846d8e75-28ed-3323-b1ee-d090b27d7c33,Shannon Bond,Netflix suspends production of ‘House of Cards’ amid Kevin Spacey controversy,2017-10-31,18:12:18,"Netflix has suspended filming of the sixth and final season of its hit drama House of Cards as the fallout from sexual misconduct claims against Kevin Spacey, the show’s leading man, widens.
The streaming video company and Media Rights Capital, the programme’s producer, issued a joint statement on Tuesday saying: “MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on House of Cards season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew.”
The suspension comes a day after Netflix said the sixth season, which is due to air in 2018, will be the series’ last. House of Cards was Netflix’s first investment in original programming and its success has served as a template for the company’s ballooning investment in content over the last six years.
Mr Spacey has been accused of making sexual advances towards the actor Anthony Rapp at a party in 1986, when Mr Rapp was 14. Mr Spacey said he did not remember the incident but apologised to Mr Rapp.
Netflix’s decision to end the show was made before the allegations became public, but on Monday it said it and MRC had sent executives to the shoot in Baltimore “to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported.” The company said Mr Spacey is not working on set.
Mr Spacey is the latest prominent man to be accused of inappropriate behaviour in the weeks since dozens of women accused Harvey Weinstein, the powerful Hollywood producer, of serial sexual harassment and assault. Mr Weinstein has denied non-consensual sexual contact. The growing scandal has shined a light on the persistence of the entertainment industry’s “casting couch” culture and the routine harassment women and many men face in the workplace.

https://www.ft.com/content/3fe008ad-b3a8-3796-b3e5-750f0c82fff5,Shannon Bond,Netflix folds House of Cards,2017-10-30,20:59:07,"Netflix is ending House of Cards, the drama that put the streaming service on the map, after its upcoming sixth season.
The show and its star, Kevin Spacey, were drawn this week into the uproar over sexual harassment and assault that is roiling Hollywood in the wake of allegations against the producer Harvey Weinstein. On Sunday, the actor Anthony Rapp alleged Mr Spacey had made sexual advances at him at a party in 1986, when Mr Rapp was 14. Mr Spacey said he did not remember the incident but apologised to Mr Rapp.
The decision to end the show was made before the allegations, according to a person familiar with the matter. The sixth season is being shot at the moment in Baltimore and will air in 2018.
In a joint statement with Media Rights Capital, the production studio behind House of Cards, Netflix said it was “deeply troubled” by the claims against Mr Spacey.
“In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time,” the companies said.
In the weeks since scores of women accused Mr Weinstein of serial sexual harassment and assault (he denies non-consensual sex), public accusations have been made about multiple men in the entertainment and media industries.
House of Cards, an adaptation of the BBC miniseries, was Netflix’s first foray into original programming and the first big hit for the company as it transformed its business from sending DVDs through the mail to streaming video over the internet. The company now spends $6bn a year on original content.

The deal, following stronger-than-expected subscriber growth in the company’s third quarter, will help finance a $7bn to $8bn budget for original content next year.
The new bonds will mature in 2028, according to a prospectus circulated to investors and seen by the FT. The company’s existing dollar-denominated debt maturing in 2026 weakened somewhat after Netflix announced its latest bond sale, with the yield on the 2026 notes rising 5 basis points to 4.41 per cent.
Morgan Stanley is leading the deal, alongside Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo and Allen & Company.

The number of global subscribers rose by 5.3m to 109.3m, almost 1m more than Netflix and Wall Street analysts had forecast, for a 29 per cent increase in net additional subscribers so far this year. 
That growth is set to continue into the fourth quarter as Netflix predicted net additions of 6.3m subscribers, even after the price rises in several markets that it announced earlier this month. Netflix is targeting “slow and steady” price increases, which it hopes to justify by increasing its library of original content. 
“Price is all relative to value,” Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said on Monday. “We are continuing to increase the content offering and we are seeing that reflected in viewing around the world. We try to maintain that feeling that consumers have that we are great value in the amount of content that we have, relative to price.”
Revenues at the US-based streaming service rose 30 per cent year-on-year to $2.99bn, exceeding analysts’ forecasts, while net income jumped 150 per cent to $130m. Netflix’s shares rose as much as 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading before settling to be 1.5 per cent higher at $205.65 — a new record. Shares in the company this year have risen more than 60 per cent.
To fuel its growth, Netflix has been spending billions of dollars on original content, from TV shows such as The Crown and Stranger Things, as well as forthcoming Will Smith movie Bright and its first series in Italian and German, Suburra and Dark. 
Netflix said its content budget would range between $7bn-$8bn next year, up from $6bn this year and higher than its executives had forecast for 2018. It said it will release about 80 original movies next year, up from only eight in the last quarter.
However, Mr Hastings effectively ruled out buying The Weinstein Company, which is facing an uncertain future after allegations of serial sexual harassment by its co-founder Harvey Weinstein. “It would be extremely unlikely for us to be a bidder for the firm,” Mr Hastings said. 
Netflix has made $17bn worth of content commitments over the next “several years”, as it plans for the day when the library of older TV shows and movies that it licenses from traditional media companies dries up.
“While we have multiyear deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear,” Netflix said. “Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes.” 
That investment in content will contribute to free cash outflows of up to $2.5bn this year, in line with its previous guidance. Netflix said it expected to turn to the debt markets to finance those costs.
The Silicon Valley-based company noted that competition was heating up, after The Walt Disney Company announced plans to launch its own streaming services and Facebook recently launched a new Watch tab for original videos. Last week, Apple secured its first TV series commission with Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories. 
In its quarterly recorded conversation with an analyst posted to YouTube on Monday, Mr Hastings played down the affect of Disney content being pulled from Netflix. Disney shows and films are only available on Netflix in a handful of countries around the world, he said, which has not impeded global growth.

https://www.ft.com/content/56fb3b11-a23a-3f60-afef-dbd48a873730,Tim Bradshaw,"Netflix subscriber growth tops estimates, revenue jumps",2017-10-16,20:46:47,"Netflix posted a 30 per cent jump in revenue to $2.99bn in its third quarter, beating analysts’ forecasts and providing a further boost to a stock price that was already trading at record highs.Net income jumped 150 per cent year-on-year to $130m, as it posted a larger-than-expected net 5.3m increase in global subscribers to 109.3m. That was higher than the about 4.5m increase that analysts had forecast, according to FactSet data. Netflix saw its shares rise by as much as 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading.
The streaming video service also forecast net subscriber growth of 6.3m for the fourth quarter that was just ahead of Wall Street expectations, despite announcing a new set of price hikes in several markets earlier this month.
“Relative to our guidance of 4.4m net adds, we under-forecasted both US and international acquisition,” Netflix said in its letter to shareholders. “Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29 per cent versus last year.”
The company added that while it expected margins to dip in the fourth quarter as it invests in marketing to promote new shows, such as the latest series of Stranger Things which debuts later this month, Netflix pledged a “steady improvement in international profitability and a growing operating margin”, as it pushes further into Asia.
By increasing prices for its HD and 4K plans, Netflix said, it would increase revenues to “help us grow our content offering and continue our global operating margin growth”.
At the same time, Netflix is stepping up its investment in content, as it plans for a time when the library of older TV shows and movies that it licenses from traditional media companies starts to wane. Netflix said it would spend up to $8bn on content next year, with $17bn in content commitments over the next “several years”.
“While we have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear,” Netflix said. “Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes.”

Asked about any potential impact from the fallout of the Weinstein crisis by an analyst during its discussion of its quarterly quarterly earnings, Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said: “It would be extremely unlikely for us to be a bidder for the firm.”
Despite the continuing fallout from the recent revelations, the Weinstein Company still owns a rich library of film and television content, some of which Netflix already shows on its streaming video service.
Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s head of content, described its business with the Weinstein Company as “pretty arm’s distance”. “It’s not material in either way,” he said. “There’s a lot of smoke to clear from what’s happening there.”

https://www.ft.com/content/e6679a36-bfc2-3ac0-b774-feddcc78403f,Pan Kwan Yuk,Netflix climbs past $200 for first time after bullish Goldman note,2017-10-13,15:07:57,"Shares in Netflix briefly crossed the $200 mark for the first time on Friday as a bullish note from Goldman Sachs helped send the stock to a fresh record high. 
The video streaming company behind hits like Stranger Things and Narcos, which has seen its shares nearly double over the past 12 months, rose as much as 2.5 per cent to hit a new peak of $200.82.
The move comes after analysts at Goldman raised their price target on the stock from $200, to $235 — the highest among Wall Street analysts. The team said in a note to clients that despite the stock’s blistering run this year, they believe there is still more upside growth thanks to recent price increases to some of its subscription plans and strong subscriber growth.
In particular, Goldman argued that consensus forecast for Netflix’s subscriber growth remains “too low” especially in light of the company’s growing investment in original content, which it said has a strong correlation to user growth.
Goldman predicts Netflix will add 13.9m net subscribers during the second half of this year, compared to market consensus of 10.8m.
…content remains the primary driver of subscriber growth and engagement (and the pricing power that comes with it)…While we are considerably above consensus…and don’t expect management to guide to our forecast, we do believe management is likely to exceed those forecasts.
Earlier this month, Netflix unveiled a new pricing scheme, which will see the cost of its mid-tier plan go up by $1 from $9.99 to $10.99 a month. Its top-tier “premium” plan will now cost $13.99 a month, a $2 increase over its previous price tag of $11.99. The bottom-tier “basic” plan is unchanged at $7.99 a month.
Goldman reckons the price increases could add as much as $0.89 to Netflix’s average revenue per user (ARPU) in the US by the first quarter of 2018.
“We believe this strategy reflects both strong engagement trends and an effort to monetize widespread password sharing,” said Goldman.
The bank is also forecasting Netflix to reach 130m international subscribers by 2020, a sharp jump from the 52m recorded in the second quarter this year. As it noted:
We continue to believe that Netflix’s content spend is the most important driver of incremental subscriber growth, particularly as we near the two year mark since the last international expansion. From both a breadth and quality perspective, the company’s content slate is well-positioned to drive subscriber growth.
Netflix is scheduled to report third quarter earnings next Monday, October 16 after the market close.

California-headquartered Netflix on Thursday debuted a new pricing scheme, which will see the cost of its mid-tier plan go up by $1 from $9.99 to $10.99 a month. Its top-tier “premium” plan will now cost $13.99 a month, a $2 increase over its previous price tag of $11.99. The bottom-tier “basic” plan is unchanged at $7.99 a month.
After the price changes were revealed, Netflix shares rose 4.25 per cent to $192.29, putting them on track for their best one-day gain since July.
Netflix has been buoyed higher in recent months by the tide lifting tech stocks — it is part of the so-called FAANG cohort that includes other consumer tech giants Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet, which have been embraced by investors whose risk appetites have been whetted by record levels for US equities.
Netflix is betting that those subscribers won’t mind shelling out an extra buck or two to tune into its original series like Stranger Things and The Crown, as well as content from other studios.
The company has been ploughing money into content of its own to attract more subscribers around the world, to face down competition from the likes of Amazon, Hulu and other on-demand streaming content services. In July, it said it had passed 100m subscribers globally and has earmarked $6bn to spend on content this year alone.
In a recent note, UBS analysts said they believed Netflix had sustained its subscriber-growth momentum through the third quarter, “despite what appears to be a weaker original content slate vs 3Q2016, suggesting growth is being driven more by the overall breadth of content on Netflix, streaming hitting critical mass in many international markets and strong marketing/tech execution.”
Over the past 12 months, the company’s shares have risen more than 80 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

https://www.ft.com/content/536f70d7-1b3c-4a45-b6fa-01ce4c4fe97a,Dan Einav,Top Boy is back for a second Netflix series,2022-03-14,05:00:58,"Plato may have contended that “no wealth can ever make a bad man at peace with himself”, but east London gangster Dushane (Ashley Walters) definitely seems to be in a happier place now his business is flourishing. 
The new series of the brilliant British crime drama Top Boy (revived by Netflix in 2019 after an earlier run on Channel 4) picks up the timeline six months after the gripping finale, in which Dushane orchestrated the arrest of rival gang leader Jamie (Micheal Ward) before offering to help facilitate his release in exchange for an alliance. 
With Jamie on-side (for now) Dushane’s cadre have been able to redouble their efforts in streamlining their drug-dealing operation. Clearly it’s much easier to make a killing when you don’t have to worry about killing others, or being killed yourself. They’ve even had time to develop green alternatives for their distribution methods — packaging their narcotics in cans reclaimed from the streets. 
Perhaps the recycling initiative is the first step in Dushane’s plan to legitimise his affairs. Having bought a deluxe new flat, he now wants to fill its rooms with a family, but his love interest, Shelley (Little Simz), still disapproves of his lawless ways. He does, however, draw the line at paying taxes, and, with a big deal in Spain imminent, he looks for financial loopholes to enable him to clean (and keep) his money. One involves investing in the redevelopment of the Summerhouse Estate he grew up on and later ruled. “It deserves to be knocked down,” he says. Even gangsters are susceptible to gentrification. 
Things don’t run smoothly for long. Negotiations in Spain unravel and result in the spilling of human sangria. Back home, one of the gang’s youngest recruits, Atticus, has disappeared. But after the breathless finale of the last series, the show patiently establishes these new narrative frameworks, allowing the overarching story of crime, community and deprivation to unfold at a slower, almost novelistic pace. 
The emotional eloquence which typified the first Netflix series of Top Boy endures. There are moving, beautifully acted scenes which explore Jamie’s paternalistic relationship with his younger brothers, and others devoted to Dushane’s partner-in-crime Sully (Kano) as he struggles to process his most unforgivable transgression. 
At another point, a car full of young black people — including Dushane’s right-hand woman, Jasmine Jobson’s shrewd, spiky Jaq — is stopped and forcibly searched by the police. It’s a scene that is perhaps even more powerful today than it would have been when the show last aired, two-and-a-half years ago.

https://www.ft.com/content/66e811a4-6bc2-417b-9083-e1526bc7047d,Danny Leigh,No time to Netflix: 13 films to see as UK cinemas reopen — and this summer,2021-05-14,04:00:47,"Film lovers exist in different time zones. Having reopened last summer, Chinese cinemas are enjoying a booming 2021, box office records broken across May Day holidays and the Lunar New Year. In Los Angeles, still the home of the American film business, some movie theatres have been open since March while operating at 50 per cent capacity (and without the totemic ArcLight chain, now permanently shuttered). 
In Britain, from next Monday audiences will be ushered out of their homes by an eager cinema trade after — in most cases — more than six months of closure. 
We have been here before, of course. Last July, the damp squib release of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet began a stop-start reopening for UK cinemas before a return to lockdown. This time the stakes are higher. After so many silent months, British cinemas need crowds back fast and in numbers. As such, the coming summer is stacked with glittering prizes to lure the Netflix-weary — Oscar winners, blockbusters, and what might even prove the occasional surprise package.
Nomadland and Sound of MetalOffering film-goers the chance to see movies already available to stream is a short-term strategy. Still, this year’s Oscar juggernaut Nomadland (with Frances McDormand, above) should draw a respectful audience. Just as deserving of the second go-around is another awards season favourite, Sound of Metal, whose bravura sound design reminds you that there is more to the big screen experience than simply the big screen. May 17
CruellaBeing released to streaming the same day it opens in cinemas, Disney’s summer spectacular will be keenly watched as an industry case study. Paying customers will find Emma Stone starring as One Hundred and One Dalmatians’ Cruella de Vil in a live-action origin story that gives Disney heritage a playfully jagged makeover, the action set against the punk explosion of 1970s London. May 28
A Quiet Place Part IIThe cinema trade often struggles to articulate what makes physical film-going unique beyond vague talk of wide-eyed wonderment. The 2018 horror A Quiet Place made a far better advert — an expert B-movie whose use of silence as plot point (grisly monsters attracted by noise) brought the live audience in on the act. The sequel too promises the kind of thrills it would be hard to match from your sofa. June 4
GundaAt a point when no one is entirely sure what sort of movie might drag people out of their Netflix torpor, documentary Gunda has the feel of a sleeper hit — a hyper-vérité portrait of the daily life of a mother pig and other livestock. Every bit as dazzling as the most lavish blockbuster. June 4
The FatherAnthony Hopkins has already won an Oscar for his performance in Florian Zeller’s adaptation of his own stage play, a study of an elderly man in the grip of memory loss. The result is a rarity: a film born of theatre that feels like cinema to its bones. June 11
In the HeightsThe movie of Broadway phenomenon Hamilton went straight to Disney Plus last summer. With Broadway itself still shuttered, In the Heights — the musical that began the career of Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda — is due into cinemas, a hip-hop-flavoured tableau of life in New York’s Washington Heights. June 18
Another RoundA generation ago, Danish director Thomas Vinterberg sent a jolt through the film world with his caustic debut Festen. Now his latest film Another Round arrives as winner of the Academy Award for Best International Feature, a wry story of the middle-aged male psyche and the siren call of alcohol. July 2
Black WidowCovid-19 sent the movies’ leading superheroes heading for the hills, the stars of the Marvel Cinematic Universe taking refuge in streaming series such as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. The comic book empire returns to the multiplex with the long-mothballed Scarlett Johansson vehicle Black Widow. July 9

CandymanThe ravening appetite of modern pop culture for all things ’90s was always going to get to the horror movies eventually. Ahead of the relaunch of the Scream franchise next year is a sequel to 1992 chiller Candyman — a period piece of deathless verve. The signs are promising here too, the director breakthrough film-maker Nia DaCosta, the producer and co-writer Jordan Peele, mastermind of expert crowd-pleaser Get Out. August 27
The NestAs London faces an uncertain future, another moment of seismic change for the city — the financial Big Bang of 1986 — acts as backdrop to The Nest, a brooding story of an British trader (Jude Law) and the family he relocates from their American home. August 27
No Time to Die$600m was the rumoured asking price at which studio backer MGM would have considered selling the new James Bond movie No Time to Die to Netflix or Apple. If so, the streamers were for once priced out of the market. For now at least, Bond remains in situ, at a cinema near you. September 30

https://www.ft.com/content/f1e8d8d4-bd3e-4b73-b4d0-446886c88516,Danny Leigh,Oscar nominations 2021: Netflix and women already winners,2021-03-15,16:01:30,"History could not have failed to be made by the 2021 Oscar nominees. It duly has, twice over. For a start, Chinese film-maker Chloé Zhao has become the first woman of colour ever nominated for the prize of Best Director. Her nomination alongside British director Emerald Fennell also makes this the first time two women will contest the category. 
Equally, after a year almost without cinemas and with enforced changes to eligibility rules, the contenders reflect 12 months in which streaming has come to define the film business. In multiple categories, the winner on the night of April 25 is likely to be Netflix. Many would argue the biggest victory is already theirs.
The single largest haul of nominations — 10, including Best Picture — went to Mank, an inky Hollywood Valentine produced by the streaming giant and directed by David Fincher. Zhao’s Nomadland, meanwhile — the story of an American woman building a new life off-grid — picked up six nominations, also including Best Picture as well as Best Actress for star Frances McDormand. Six nominations were also secured by Minari, Judas and the Black Messiah, The Trial of the Chicago 7, The Father and Sound of Metal.
That even field might be put down to a year in which blockbuster release plans and awards campaigns have been upended by the pandemic. A new accommodation with streaming is one result. As far back as last April, the Academy was moved to relax eligibility rules that insisted Oscar contenders must screen first in a cinema and play for at least seven days in Los Angeles. (By then LA cinemas had already been closed for a month; some, not all, reopen this week.) The pandemic has rendered moot previous frictions between the Academy and Netflix. As well as Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7 and the 1920s-set Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom were released by the company, which claimed a total of 35 nominations.
Recent years have also seen the Oscars dogged by complaints over shortfalls in diversity. Last year, an all-male list for Best Director caused dismay. The Academy will hope a page has been turned with the nominations of Zhao and Fennell, who was shortlisted for her debut Promising Young Woman.

Acting categories too have previously caused upset with a perceived exclusion of performers of colour. Not so this year. Best Actor nominees include the late Chadwick Boseman for his performance in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Riz Ahmed (Sound of Metal) and Stephen Yeun (Minari). Boseman’s co-star Viola Davis is nominated for Best Actress alongside Andra Day, the breakout star of The United States vs Billie Holiday. Best Supporting Actor nominees include two performers from Judas and the Black Messiah, Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield, as well as Leslie Odom Jr for One Night in Miami. 
In a typical year, the Oscars tend to spotlight one unfamiliar name above all others. In 2021, Day and Fennell aside, novelty surrounds the Best Supporting Actress nomination of Maria Bakalova, who managed the impossible by upstaging Sacha Baron Cohen in the raucous Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. Still, shed no tears for Baron Cohen. Not only did his sequel also receive a nod for Best Original Screenplay, the star himself will compete for Best Supporting Actor for The Trial of the Chicago 7.
Now comes the next phase of campaigning, a deeply political process usually centred on undistanced Hollywood schmoozing. At some point before April 25, the Academy will also reveal how many — if any — of the nominees will be able to physically attend the ceremony. Covid is not ready for its closing credits yet.
The nominees in the four main awards categories are as follows:

US president Donald Trump is scheduled to face Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Thursday in the last presidential debate before the election on November 3.
It is set to be a face-to-face event at Belmont University in Nashville. Kristen Welker of NBC News will be the moderator.
The end of the race is fast approaching after twists and turns including a chaotic first debate full of interruptions, which resulted in positive poll numbers for Mr Biden, who is leading the race with 51.6 per cent.
The fundraising figures for September highlight the hurdles that the president is facing compared with his rival. The Republican National Committee raised $248m, significantly less than the $383m haul reported by Mr Biden and the Democrats for the same month.
In-person voting starts in Wisconsin, Hawaii and Utah on Tuesday. Mr Trump won in Wisconsin by a small margin in 2016 but polls show the state is leaning towards Mr Biden, by six points.
US senators will vote on Tuesday on whether to issue a subpoena to Jack Dorsey, Twitter chief executive, following the social media platform’s decision to restrict a New York Post article about Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, which it said violated its policies on hacked materials. 
Officials expect members of the Republican majority to do so, and potentially to issue one also to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief executive. 
Analysts say the hearing, which has already been scheduled for Friday, will give Republican senators a chance to voice their anger towards the industry in general, following a series of moves by Silicon Valley companies that have enraged those on the right.

Import and exports figures for September also hit records with imported goods in dollar terms surpassing pre-pandemic levels and a strong demand for electric components from outside the country.
Retail sales data for September, also out on Monday, will provide an update on consumer spending — a weak spot in the recovery, at a time when many Chinese households have remained cautious. Sales of retail goods returned to year-on-year growth of 0.5 per cent in August, after seven straight months of decline.
In the US, the housing market is benefiting considerably from ultra-low interest rates and the National Association of Home Builders is on Monday expected to report steady confidence in the sector.

Flash PMI surveys for October, released on Friday, are likely to offer more evidence of the Europe’s fading recovery, with services forecast to be hit much harder than manufacturing.
Elsewhere, Japanese trade data is out on Monday, UK inflation figures are set to rebound on Wednesday, in part due to the expiry of the government’s Eat Out to Help Out restaurant support scheme. UK retail sales figures are due on Friday.

https://www.ft.com/content/51fc3d7e-3ab4-4430-93b0-46d065990ab7,Suzi Feay,Netflix’s Stateless wrings affecting drama from Australian immigration,2020-07-03,15:17:48,"Cate Blanchett has a small but showy role as a gushing motivational speaker in this gritty new series but presumably her passion resides on the production side, where she is billed as co-creator. Stateless focuses on the humanitarian crisis of Australia’s immigration detention centres, dramatising the failings of a system that appears doomed to reduce both sides to incomprehension, mistrust and debasement. 
It might seem paradoxical that so much screen time is given to a detainee who is white and European, when most are from Muslim countries, but as one migrant cynically puts it, this “lily among the reeds” has the best chance of becoming “our voice . . . the face of our suffering”. Sofie Werner (Yvonne Strahovski), swamped and suffocated by the demands of her strict German parents, temporarily finds empowerment in a local dance studio run by sinister couple Pat and Gordon Masters (Blanchett and Dominic West). Really it’s a cover for a manipulative self-actualisation cult: a cross between Strictly Ballroom and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. 
Bizarrely, Sofie ends up at Barton Detention Centre, begging to be sent back to the motherland, having stolen the identity of a German backpacker. In stark contrast, Ameer (Fayssal Bazzi) has been smuggled overland from Afghanistan, then put to sea having been separated from his wife and two young daughters. Sofie’s struggle for a meaningful life could look self-indulgent when contrasted with Ameer’s desperate desire simply to stay alive. It helps that Strahovski is sensational in the role of Sofie, a woman flailing on the edge of madness. 
Newly appointed guard Cameron (Jai Courtney) has a natural instinct to help and befriend, but erecting a swing for the young detainees earns him a reprimand for creating a hanging risk. His aim of remaining decent and fair in all his dealings with the UNCs — unlawful non-citizens — soon takes a battering from his colleagues, not least the vicious Harriet (Rachel House, terrifying). 
Brian (Darren Gilshenan), the opera-loving manager of the centre, doesn’t want to peer too closely into the day-to-day application of discipline, at least until the pervasive problem of the Tamils demonstrating on the roof attracts the attention of a concerned media. Canberra’s immigration chiefs send enforcer Clare Kowitz (Asher Keddie) to clean up the mess and damp down the bad publicity. 
For Brian, the descent into despair and chaos in the camp is more a result of bureaucracy than brutishness, his desk piled high with applications and files. It feels a little forced that Clare is personally acquainted with the journalist on the story who acts as the prod to her conscience, but overall Stateless is a faceted exploration of a key issue of our time, and deeply affecting whenever Ameer’s huge, pained eyes swim into view.

https://www.ft.com/content/d5fe4b3c-c4cb-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9,Izabella Kaminska,"American Factory, Netflix — harsh truths about the new world of work",2019-08-25,04:00:32,"If anyone was going to convince a Chinese industrial billionaire to let an independent American film crew document the sensitive inner workings of a former GM plant in Ohio, as it geared up for reopening under new management, it was going to be Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert. 
The Dayton, Ohio-based pair had already documented the closure of the plant in an Academy Award-nominated HBO film called The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant, while Reichert offered an impressive résumé of labour-themed titles including the award-winning Union Maids, and Seeing Red: Stories of American Communists. 
So when someone from the new Chinese plant owner, Fuyao, decided they should chronicle the reopening, which marked a historic moment in Sino-US relations, the pair’s names came up pretty quickly. 
“The original idea of the company was that they would hire us,” says Bognar. The pair said no, wanting to keep their independence and editorial control, and yet, Bognar says, “the company still really gave us access, real access.”
Chairman Cao Dewang, the founder and CEO of Fuyao — a glass manufacturer whose company song proudly talks of “holding up a transparent world” — surprisingly agreed to the terms. The result of that unprecedented access agreement is American Factory, which has just premiered on Netflix.
The pair started filming immediately, initially unfunded, until they teamed up with Participant Media, the makers of An Inconvenient Truth. The film was then picked up by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company Higher Ground at the Sundance film festival, becoming its first major release — something which delighted Reichert, who says she has always been a big Obama fan.
Despite the political connections, American Factory is not a partisan film. It was important to Reichert — who is acutely aware Ohio is a critical swing state — to make a film that Trump supporters would connect with too. The aim, in her mind, was to depolarise matters; to create a space where people on both sides of today’s deeply divided political spectrum could grapple with contemporary issues in a considered way, from

		and automation to increased demands on productivity of workers. 
It’s fair to say the film succeeds on this front. Both Americans and Chinese, workers and management, are depicted as equally virtuous and flawed.
“We had to be neutral,” says Bognar. “If we’re trying to be honourable film-makers, our own personal point of view couldn’t be a factor in that.”
Part of the honesty owes a lot to Reichert and Bognar’s style of vérité filming. There are no voice-overs, central characters, heroes or villains. An occasional caption or well-placed wide-shot provides the all-important narrative-forming context. 
Particularly telling are the glimpses of overly stylised and outsized portraits of the chairman throughout the plant, the Chinese-centric films being shown on monitors in the cafeteria, and the grammatically incorrect inspiration motto “Marching forward to be world leading automotive glass provider” atop the entrance hallway. 
Thus we transition neutrally from the early optimism of the plant’s opening, when the Chinese investment was seen as reviving the local community and creating important opportunities for blue-collar jobs, to the growing resentment among the American workforce about the Chinese management’s very Stakhanovite way of doing things. The culture clash sees the Chinese regularly describe American workers as inefficient or fat-fingered. Americans complain about Chinese disrespect for local laws, a lax approach to health and safety and mandatory overtime that eats into the weekend.
Neutrality was further enhanced by the language barriers in place at the time of filming. Often, Bognar and Reichert had no idea what was even being said.
“We filmed a lot [of] meetings in Mandarin but we wouldn’t get them translated for like a year later, so we had no idea what was being said. And then when we finally get the transcript back we’re like ‘Oh, that’s what they were saying!’” says Bognar.
In one meeting, Chinese workers are told that Americans don’t place great importance on outfits or attire. In another, Chinese management tells them their co-workers are overconfident because American children are overly showered with praise. But the crux of the drama is soon centred not just around culture clashes but Fuyao’s staunch opposition to workers’ attempts to form a union.
It’s only here that Bognar and Reichert feel freer to editorialise, reflecting their longstanding pro-union positions. We learn, for example, from a well-placed caption that Fuyao paid LRI, a union avoidance consulting specialist, more than $1m to keep workers from forming a union.
We found our heads spinning regularly that the communists are now the best capitalists in the world
The film-makers say the appointment of such firms was clearly designed to confuse people. They feel it skewed the eventual election outcome — which saw a 60 per cent vote against union formation — because workers were forced to attend meetings on work time where the company could finely tailor its anti-union message to them. The union opposition had no capacity to capture its audience in the same way.
Chairman Cao’s views on unions, meanwhile, are set out clearly from the beginning. “You all know how we stand on this. We don’t want to see the union developing here. If we have a union it will impact our efficiency, thus hurting our company, it will create loss for us. If a union comes in, I’m shutting down, ” he tells his fellow Chinese employees.
The irony of a Chinese company’s cut-throat opposition to union formation and its obsessive pursuit of profit against all else is not lost on either Bognar or Reichert. Or the fact that the first secretary of Fuyao’s Communist party committee back in China is chairman Cao’s brother-in-law. 
“We found our heads spinning regularly that the communists are now the best capitalists in the world and that they’re all in the union but they oppose a union,” says Bognar. 
It’s hard, perhaps, to understand why the Chinese didn’t appreciate the extent to which the film-makers’ democratic leaning and pro-union politics would work against them. But perhaps the Chinese realised that what they had in common with Americans would shine through and bridge the gap. 
It does. As Reichert notes, the film allows for an intimate insight into how globalisation looks on a very human scale at one US factory. The takeaway in her mind is that Chinese and American workers on the floor have more in common with each other than they do with their respective owners and managers. American Factory reflects their common humanity. In the closing scenes, it’s clear that automation is a universal threat.
In the current context of US-Chinese trade wars and protectionism, that’s probably something worth remembering.

https://www.ft.com/content/52fc3be4-adf7-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2,Matthew Vincent,ITV will need more than ‘Love Island’ to woo Netflix viewers,2019-07-24,17:29:57,"ITV has found a way to double one of its revenue streams: it will now broadcast its clothing-lite dating show Love Island twice a year. BBC Radio 4’s Today programme sniffed that “it encourages people to behave pretty horribly to each other”, before cutting to news about incoming prime minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet sackings. One City commentator called the show “a necessary evil” — and he worked for a spread betting firm. But ITVs half-year results showed why boss Carolyn McCall is willing to risk critics’ disdain by putting scantily clad orange people on screens of all sizes, in all seasons. 
ITV’s total external revenue fell another 7 per cent in the period, to £1.48bn, as advertising sales, although better than forecast, declined by 5 per cent. Adjusted earnings fell by an even bigger 13 per cent, to £327m, reflecting much needed investment in data analysis and the Hub catch-up service — but excluding £3m being put into BritBox, its streaming venture with the BBC. 
Dame Carolyn must therefore employ all the levers at her disposal: maximising TV audiences, selling more shows and building streaming subscriptions. But, as on Love Island, the question is: which can she realistically pull?
Maximising audiences and the revenues generated from them looks difficult, as ITV is already exploiting every opportunity it can. Love Island’s 6m viewers are urged to buy make-up, accessories and suitcases from an online shop, as well as ordering takeaways, gadgets and toiletries from no fewer that nine programme sponsors. It has squeezed an extra £8m out of these partners in the past year alone. Nor can the investment in data analytics be expected to yield much quickly, as targeting ads specifically at 16-34 year olds is only of value if sponsors haven’t taken all their money first. 
Selling more shows holds out some possibilities. The Love Island format has been sold to 12 other countries, and other ITV Studios productions have generated £130m more revenue this year than last. That is 5 per cent growth at a 14-16 margin. However, unlike those in the island villa, these figures can be lumpy.
Building online subscriptions via BritBox may take longer, though. As more advanced rivals Netflix and Amazon have found, streaming services need content that is original, bears repeat viewing or is timeless. Love Island is arguably none of these — and even ITV’s award-winning dramas will have already been available free of charge to 30m viewers via the Hub service. What’s more, streaming services have to balance investing in content with charging a competitive price. Netflix is burning through £3.5bn of cash a year while asking its subscribers for $12.99 or £8.99 a month. Britbox’s pilot service in the US charges less: just $6.99. It aims to break even in the UK in three to five years. But there is clearly a risk ITV will have to wait longer for a profitable outcome — in contrast to Love Island couples running into the arms of the tabloids.

Chris Smith’s gripping documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened (Netflix, from January 18) tells the story of the grand project that lurched from incompetence to fraud, finally delivering an entirely different sort of decadence to the “party like a rock star” ethos it promised. 
The two masterminds, or rather mini-minds, behind the fiasco were the rapper Ja Rule and the “tech entrepreneur” Billy McFarland, with their big dreams and even bigger cigars. Fyre was born as an app offering exclusive access to VIPs, and Fyre the festival was intended to draw attention to the brand and boost its potential as a multimillion-dollar platform. 
The lies begin early, with McFarland claiming he has bought a private island in the Bahamas for the event. The promotional shoot is key, a confection of top models — including Bella Hadid — white sand, sun, palm trees, beach huts, cocktails and more cigars. It’s depressing to see beautiful women used as bait in this way, and even more depressing to see that it worked. “Could ya all like hashtag some Fyre festival shit,” yells Rule. Despite the creators having no music festival experience, 95 per cent of the tickets sold in 48 hours. 
Norman’s Cay had once belonged to drug lord Carlos Lehder, a fact the organisers were told not to publicise by the island’s actual owners. But since this connection provided exactly the sort of sleazy ambience the organisers were after, they couldn’t resist crowing about it, with the result that they were thrown off the Cay and on to Great Exuma, a much grittier site. But no worries, simply Photoshop the map so it looks like it’s still just a small island. The smoke and mirrors continued, with Kendall Jenner being paid a six-figure sum for one Instagram post, and “influencers” trading PR for free tickets. 
The documentary isn’t entirely clear on some points, possibly for legal reasons. Where does the money go, exactly? Why does Ja Rule mysteriously disappear from the footage halfway through? As launch date approaches, a desperate McFarland operates a kind of entertainment Ponzi scheme, encouraging punters to load up their smart bracelets with a minimum of $3,000, and selling imaginary excursions, villa packages and add-ons in order to raise funds to provide services already booked and paid for by previous clients. 
In the end, festival-goers arrived in the dark to a half-built site and a dismal tent city, more Lord of the Flies than The Great Gatsby. A snap of the “gourmet food” fittingly went viral. The abiding image of the Fyre festival is not Hadid in a bikini, it’s a dry cheese sandwich.

Fortunately regional economic growth figures published by the Office for National Statistics last week provided a useful reminder that tech, as much as international trade, is transforming how we work and play.
While London continued to grow faster than the rest of the country during 2017, the explanation provided by the ONS was that this was not driven by Britain's traditional fast growing pharmaceutical and finance sectors, which provided much of the UK's pre-crisis growth, but by TV producers and delivery drivers.
In 2015 Douglas McWilliams coined the term “Flat White Economy” for London's future, envisioning a world where creatives, artisans and hipsters fuelled an urban renaissance, but instead it looks increasingly like the city is moving towards a “Netflix and chill economy” where consumers stay home, watch the telly and order in takeaway.
In the capital, the TV and film industry expanded by 21 per cent in 2017 while postal and courier services grew by 15 per cent, matching rapid expansion in the sectors for the UK as a whole.
Overall since 2010, output of the TV and film industry has risen by 97 per cent and postal and courier activities by 29 per cent. That compares to a contraction of 13 per cent in finance and 32 per cent in pharmaceutical production. 
Partly this reflects regulatory and policy choices — politicians have clamped down on excess leverage in the financial sector while providing tax breaks for film and TV production that features UK content — but is also reflects technological change too.
New applications like Deliveroo and Uber have created demand for couriers while Netflix and Amazon Prime have an insatiable appetite for new content — my colleague Matthew Garrahan reports that Netflix currently has 40 productions taking place in the UK. 
On the other hand technological pace has slowed elsewhere: a number of “blockbuster” patents have ended and Britain’s pharmaceutical companies are finding it harder to find new sources of revenue to replace them. 
Comparative Advantage is taking a Christmas Break, we will be back on January 16
The ONS will announce how it will treat student loans in the government’s accounts. At present the accounting flatters public borrowing because the money paid out does not appear as expenditure but the interest payments count as income, if the national statistics agency decide to change how they appear in the accounts it could reduce the amount available for the Chancellor to spend. The Resolution Foundation has the full details here. 
Inflation held steady at 2.4 per cent in October, frustrating City economists’ expectations for a rise. While the pound has fallen since October oil prices have fallen too, potentially leading to another drop in the rate of inflation. 
Reports suggest that the festive season has been pretty bleak for the UK high street this year, however official retail sales includes online as well as traditional shopping so a slowdown in footfall might not register in the stats. Troubles with seasonal adjustments might also affect the measure.

		until a Brexit deal is done, or not. While the uncertainty continues the BoE is expected to leave interest rates on hold at 0.75 per cent. Instead expect an update on how policymakers see the recent uptick in wage growth and the effects of the government's latest budget on growth. 
Borrowing jumped in October as spending accelerated and tax receipts disappointed. Economists will be watching to see if that continued during November or if the October results were just a blip in what has been a good year overall for public borrowing. 
The second edition of growth figures are likely to reaffirm the 0.6 per cent rate of expansion registered by the first edition. However we will also get new revised business investment data and an update on the UK’s balance of payments with the rest of the world. 
We are more productive than we thought, according to new OECD research. UK statisticians do not adjust self-reported measures of hours worked as other countries do meaning our hourly productivity is not as bad relative to other countries as official measures suggested.

https://www.ft.com/content/7bf0709c-fc63-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e,Suzi Feay,"The Innocent Man, Netflix — devastating true-crime series for those unsated by Making a Murderer",2018-12-11,05:00:38,"Those with an appetite for true crime unslaked by Making a Murderer will relish The Innocent Man (Netflix, from December 14), another story from the possibly bottomless pit of US wrongful convictions. They are starting to look eerily familiar, but any sense of by-numbers film-making on director Clay Tweel’s part is quickly dissipated by the horrifying particular details. There is nothing rote about the murders of two young women in Ada, Oklahoma, and the tortuous quest for justice that followed.
The six-part documentary series is adapted from a 2006 book by John Grisham, who appears as one of the interviewees. Ada had its sketchy areas, but the 1982 rape and murder of Debbie Carter and the subsequent abduction of Denice Haraway marked a new level of depravity, and the local police department, as usual, was pressured to bring swift results. Unlike an hour-long crime programme, where the (predominantly young, female) victims can come across like McGuffins, and the convictions a slam-dunk, a lengthy, even leisurely series such as this one gives due weight to the personality of the deceased and the wider effects of the crime. 
The impact of a murder ripples far outwards, inflicting cruel pain on relatives of victim and accused alike. In the Carter case, local men Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz were eventually charged. But Williamson, an injured former sports star, was bipolar and Fritz still traumatised by the murder of his own wife, shot through the window of their home on Christmas Eve. 
The story is ingeniously played out, each episode ending on a cliffhanger that makes binge-watching virtually unavoidable. Seeing Williamson give what looks like a callous, taunting laugh on being accused of killing Carter seems utterly damning until, several episodes later, the context is revealed. In the case of Haraway, abducted from the convenience store where she worked (surely working alone late at night in a store is the true-crime equivalent of venturing into the cellar in a horror movie), the two accused, Karl Fontenot and Tommy Ward, sang like canaries, while assuring police on camera that they hadn’t been coerced. With no body, the case was one of “corpus delicti”, so confessions were crucial. The details of the death were horrific, as was the men’s sang-froid in the telling, but Fontenot was of below normal intelligence and their accounts didn’t stack up. 
Just as in Making a Murderer, there is a prosecutor in the line of fire: in this case Bill Peterson, common to both investigations. Christy Shepperd, Carter’s cousin, was so troubled by the aftermath that she became an advocate for reform of the legal system. As dreadful as her cousin’s death was, the revelation that “she was just

Management pledged to protect dividends by slowing growth and concentrating on cash generation. 
● Mediclinic slumped to a record low after a first-half trading update from the hospital operator revealed continued problems in Switzerland due to regulatory changes and disappointing in-patient admissions. Management cut its margin target for the Swiss business as well as paring revenue growth guidance to reflect fewer basic-tariff patients in the United Arab Emirates. 
“Mediclinic is operating in a tough environment where regulation and outmigration, and the pace at which change is occurring, is having a significant impact on the business. We understand it is difficult for the company to predict the endgame here, as it is evolving fast, but we expect the miss on guidance and lack of visibility will be taken negatively by the market.”
● Flybe hit a record low on a profit warning, with the regional airline blaming higher costs combined with a deterioration of domestic and near-continent demand in recent weeks.
● US airline stocks climbed after United Continental raised earnings guidance. United said with third-quarter results that it would deliver full-year

		of $8.00 to $8.75, compared with a previous low-end target of $7.25.
“United’s forward outlook is likely to satiate even the most demanding of bulls, in our view, with an implied earnings range of which the low end surpasses all current estimates. As was the case in July, we’re struggling to find things to complain about, despite our most cantankerous efforts. With many investors having questioned whether United’s sector-trouncing equity outperformance might stall into year-end, we believe these results strongly suggest the contrary.”
● Netflix jumped after its quarterly results showed both its US and International divisions outperforming market expectations. Management also raised guidance for fourth-quarter net subscriber growth and said its annual cash burn would be at the lower end of the $3bn to $4bn target range, with 2019 likely to be similar. 
Buckingham Research remained cautious. A current share price of about $386 implies that Netflix will have 460m global members by 2025, compared with 146.5m at the end of the third quarter, it said. But more than three-quarters of the growth needs to come from markets other than the US and western Europe, which may be a challenge, argued Buckingham Research. The broker picked out the Indian market as likely to “remain competitively intense and difficult to fully monetise”.
● HSBC upgraded Go-Ahead to “buy” and cut Stagecoach to “hold”.
A recovery for Stagecoach’s provincial bus operations has been cancelled out by problems in London and the US, which will keep a lid on earnings, said HSBC. While Stagecoach may look good value at just over 8 times current year earnings, the stock still trades at a premium to peers based on its enterprise valuation in spite of its lack of an obvious route to growth outside rail, the broker said.
On Go-Ahead, HSBC said London bus earnings look protected from spending cuts given the transport group has already retendered a large number of its contracts. It also noted that the award of the strategically important franchise to run the South Eastern rail service has been pushed back to early next year, so some significant time would have elapsed since the summer fiasco at Go-Ahead’s Govia Thameslink Railway. The Go-Ahead share price is underpinned by

		from bus operations with rail and international expansion providing option value, said HSBC, which set a £19.70 target.
● Liberum started coverage of Sophos, the security software maker, with a “buy” stance and 530p target. It said the stock’s valuation of 38 times current-year earnings looked cheap versus a peer group at 41 times.
“Sophos’ shares have been battered year to date on the back of both perceived competitive pressures and a disappointing first-quarter billings growth rate. However, the company has a leading cloud platform which combined with top-performing products can drive cross-selling into existing and new customers. We expect billings to return to fast growth in the second half, and the midterm guidance of circa $1bn in billings remains deliverable”
● HSBC cut its target price on Inchcape, the car dealership operator, to 650p from 860p and repeated “hold” advice. It cited sharply lower new-car sales in the UK and Australia as well as a strengthening of the yen against the Australian dollar, which the broker said would increase Subaru import costs. 
● Deutsche Bank started coverage of Fevertree Drinks, the tonic water maker, with a “hold” rating and £30 target. Slowing growth over the medium term makes Fevertree’s valuation look “a bit stretched” at 50 times current-year earnings, a 150 per cent premium to the European consumer staples sector, it said.
● In brief: ConvaTec cut to “underperform” at Credit Suisse; Essentra raised to “buy” at Jefferies; KPN upgraded to “overweight” at Barclays; Logitech upgraded to “neutral” at JPMorgan; Michelin downgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Safran downgraded to “underperform” at Jefferies; Telekom Austria raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux.

		clients, similar to those used by a host of consumer technology companies.
The move is in its early stages of development, with the task of reliably recommending interesting trades to investors posing very different challenges from suggesting a new indie band to listen to or what fresh comedy show to watch.
Nonetheless, the broad theory behind the initiative is the same, as finance increasingly borrows from the innovations of Silicon Valley’s technology companies. Increasing cost pressure on banks, coupled with the rise of computer-powered market players, has pushed banks to boost investment in their technology and explore new ways to automate some of their core businesses. 
“Imagine what the world looked like when you watched television and had to scan through channels, whereas now it is not only on demand, it is presented to you so you easily find what you are looking for,” said Giuseppe Nuti, who heads up data science in UBS’s FX, rates and credit Strategic Development Lab. “That’s what we are trying to do for our clients, presenting them with a choice of likely, interesting trades.”
Just as people once took recommendations for TV shows or new music from friends or industry critics, a bank’s clients have often listened to recommendations from trained salespeople. UBS is hoping to make this process more automated, taking inputs of a client’s previous trading behaviour to assess whether they might be interested in a specific transaction.
And it’s not just for clients. The technology should help pinpoint investors that will want to buy something UBS is trying to sell, and vice versa. 
“A good sales person calls his or her client and goes over what they think will be interesting for the day,” said Mr Nuti. “We are trying to automate that. It means the job of a sales person, which in many ways has remained immune to the technology revolution, will likely change.”
The algorithm is currently being trialled in the bank’s corporate bond trading business but there are hopes to roll it out to other asset classes as well. At the moment, recommendations produced by the technology are sent to salespeople to decide whether or not they should be passed on to clients, but over time the plan is to eliminate the middle man.
The challenge is finding enough data to plug into the recommendation engine for it to produce reliable results, said Mr Nuti. Each new TV show watched, or song listened to, is indicative of the type of music or television that a person likes. But it is harder to group trades into similar themes, says Mr Nuti, because people execute transactions for very specific reasons.
Other electronic trading experts have also urged caution. “While it sounds intelligent and advanced, a client should definitely ask a lot of questions about the construction of such a recommendation algorithm,” said Christian Hauff, co-founder of Quantitative Brokers, a trading algorithm company. “Creating and managing a financial instrument portfolio is not the same as creating and managing a playlist.”

B Riley FBR analysts said that with Netflix trading at nearly 140 times 2018 earnings, the risk of a commissioning misfire was significant enough to avoid the stock. “Other content creators have dry spells. Netflix has not seen that yet. It is possible that after huge successes that Netflix’s ability to create hit new shows may be settling into a robust plateau,” the team said. “Netflix would argue that this could influence quarterly results, but that its full-year growth will be driven by the deep library. That assertion has yet to be tested, because Netflix has not yet had a sustained dry spell for impactful new content. If that happens, we suspect that subs growth would be impacted.”

		gainers after a first-quarter trading update from the group came in slightly ahead of expectations, with growth for its pan-European parcels business offsetting a revenue decline in the UK. Management also reiterated full-year guidance for UK letter volumes and margins. 
TalkTalk rallied after the broadband provider left full-year guidance unchanged, in spite of delivering mixed first-quarter results. Net customer additions were better than analysts expected, with TalkTalk adding 80,000 accounts in the period, though the increase was via wholesale rather than its own brand after an unidentified company migrated its customer base from a rival provider.
WPP and Publicis retreated after US peer Omnicom’s quarterly update showed weaker growth than expected. Deteriorating demand in the UK and US meant Omnicom’s organic sales slowed from 2.4 per cent in the first quarter to 2.0 per cent in the second, which missed a consensus forecast of 2.7 per cent growth.
Publicis is due to deliver second-quarter figures this week, while WPP’s next scheduled report is in early September.

		beat consensus forecasts by 7 per cent on in-line revenue, thanks to reduced investment costs, which “confirms improving operational gearing”, said JPMorgan Cazenove, which called Schibsted “the best play in online classifieds”. 
● Goldman Sachs upgraded Asos to “buy” from “neutral” with a £79 target. Accelerating momentum in the US and EU from next year will deliver 24 per cent sales growth in the financial year ending 2020, putting Asos on a path to increase sales from £1.9bn last year to about £7bn by 2024.
Historically, Asos has generated £7 of incremental revenue for every £1 of capital expenditure, said Goldman. It also forecast that falling warehouse and distribution costs would help offset headwinds including US import duty and an increasing reliance on third-party brands, which would squeeze gross margin to 49.9 per cent by 2021. “We also view beauty as an incremental opportunity. Amid tough competition, we expect Asos to continue to differentiate versus incumbent and newer players,” said the broker.
● Citigroup upgraded Stagecoach to “neutral” from “sell” after its dividend cut last month, which followed the transport group being ordered by government to hand back the East Coast rail franchise.
“Although we see some further risks remaining, the worst now appears to be behind,” said Citi. Its 281p-a-share sum-of-the-parts valuation included just 6p for Stagecoach’s rail operations, against 242p for the UK regional bus division. “While the company is shortlisted to bid on three rail franchises, we think the recent East Coast situation makes a new franchise win unlikely in the short term,” it said.
● Berenberg repeated “sell” advice on Greene King in a note calling the pub operator “a value trap”.
Underlying trading looks poor, with Greene King delivering just 2.2 per cent like-for-like sales growth in the first eight weeks of its 2019 fiscal year in spite of warm weather and the World Cup,” said Berenberg. “Even in one of the best periods for the pub trade in recent history, Greene King did not achieve adequate like-for-like growth to offset cost increases and increase earnings,” it added.
The broker also criticised last year’s refinancing of high interest-rate bonds tied to its Spirit acquisition, saying management had been “disingenuous with shareholders”. Highlighting that the deal had an exceptional cash charge of nearly £50m attached, Berenberg said: “Management refused to tell us the

● Investec downgraded Paddy Power Betfair to “sell” from “buy”, with an £80.10 target. Its downgrade follows the US Supreme Court in May freeing individual states to allow sports betting by ruling that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, was unconstitutional.
“While Paddy Power Betfair has significant first-mover advantage in the US, we caution that, especially post the recent re-rating, it is very much a long-term value-driven strategy,” said Investec. “UK gaming stocks, especially Paddy Power Betfair, saw a significant re-rating in relation to the US repeal of PASPA (arguably up to 27 per cent), and we question whether gambling stocks will continue to tick up on further positive US news (as US state regulation is announced) or drift down as investors realise fundamental value is opaque, skewed to US-listed incumbents (licence issuers), and longer term in nature.”
Valuing the bookmaker’s US operations at 850p a share, or 50 per cent of the full value to reflect regulatory risks, Investec said the shares look too expensive against key peers GVC and William Hill.
● In brief: Morgan Advanced Materials raised to “overweight” at JPMorgan; Amino Technologies rated new “buy” at Liberum; Proximus upgraded to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Michelin upgraded to “buy” at HSBC; Brunello Cucinelli cut to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs; Assa Abloy downgraded to “reduce” at HSBC; SBM Offshore cut to “market perform” at Bernstein; Siemens Gamesa and Vestas Wind Systems rated new “buy” at UBS.

Welcome back from New York, where the most significant event of the market day may have happened immediately after the market closed. The after-hours market did not like Netflix's results one little bit, as is shown by this chart, which uses Bloomberg data:
That 13 per cent fall after-hours may yet be seen as a turning point. Of all the Fang stocks (originally for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), Netflix has always looked the most uncomfortably similar to the dotcom stocks from 1999. It is burning a lot of cash and relying on junk-rated debt to keep going, with a business model that seems easy to copy. 
We, of course, know that the Fangs have led the market for most of the time since the presidential election in November 2016:
Perhaps less appreciated is the way Netflix has taken the lead among the Fangs this year:

First, the market is now plainly positioned for more rate rises, with two more this year regarded as a certainty, and three as a likelihood:
If Jay Powell wanted to convince the market that he meant business, then he has succeeded. The reason he might well mean business is that the US economy, if not that of the rest of the world, shows real signs of overheating.
