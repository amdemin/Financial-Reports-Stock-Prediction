Fellow shareholders,    We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew  streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million  in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than  doubled global operating income.  .    1  Q4 Results  Average paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in  ASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5%  margin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating  margin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year.   EPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items  that affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X  remeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which  partially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed  repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform.   In Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last  year’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than  expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet  entertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based.  In the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3  million. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although  contribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the  marketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter.   Internationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record  for quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue  and ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments  in a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017  (4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution  profit in our history.   We took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward  with. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected  expense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger  than expected member growth and the timing of international content spend.  Forecast  The guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net  adds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally.  As we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year  2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year.   We believe our big investments in content are paying off.  In 2017, average streaming hours per  membership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more  revenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018.   2  Big hits like ​13 Reasons Why​, ​Stranger Things​ and ​Bright ​result from a combination of great content and  great marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about  $1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content,  and we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll  grow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018.   Content  Q4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of ​The Crown​ and ​Black  Mirror​ as well as ​Stranger Things​, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon​.​ In the quarter, we  also successfully launched new titles like the limited series ​Godless​, ​Marvel’s The Punisher​ and  Mindhunter​ (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s  amazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had ​three of the Top  5​ most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row.   Our largest investment in original films to date, ​Bright, ​a fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a  major success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, ​Bright​ has become one of our  most viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well  as additional investment in original films.   We’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of ​Club de  Cuervos ​as well as ​The Day I Met El Chapo,​ both of which are from Mexico; ​Suburra​ from Italy; and an  unscripted series from the UK, ​Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father​. We also debuted ​Dark​, our first  German original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for  instance, ​Dark​, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions  of members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with  attractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this  initiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland,  India, Korea and Japan.   We are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall  deals with ​Stranger Things​ producer Shawn Levy and ​Orange is the New Black​ and ​GLOW​ creator Jenji  Kohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over  the world.  Product and Partnerships  We are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our  mutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix,  while our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of  these types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche  Telekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC  removed the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net  3  neutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the  FCC’s action.   Competition  We have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend  becomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On  the commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large  content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with  Apple Music or with iOS.   Facebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their  multi-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for  entertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix.   Traditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring  most of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand  and great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful  services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content  offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower  end of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of  content payments, which will now occur in 2018.   Our operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is  content. When we develop a title like ​Bright​, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated  membership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for  self-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect  that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend  will turn our business FCF positive.   In the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re  growing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had  planned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018.  Given our track record of content  investments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the  increased investments we are making in original content this year.   We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of  interest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to  grow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt.  High yield has rarely seen  an equity cushion so thick.  4  Board of Directors  We are pleased to add ​Rodolphe Belmer​ to our board of directors. Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+  Group in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing  percentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our  board.   Summary  Our goal is to entertain people. We are thrilled to be able to do that at great scale.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
