In Q3, we grew to $5.2 billion in revenue, up 31% over the prior year, and operating income doubled to $1.0 billion. Paid net adds totaled 6.8m compared to our 7.0m forecast and prior year Q3 of 6.1m. As we’ve improved the variety, diversity and quality of our content slate, member engagement has grown, revenue has increased, and we’re able to further fund our content investment. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast In Q3’19, average streaming paid memberships and ARPU grew 22% and 9% year over year, respectively. Excluding a -$137m year over year impact from F/X, consolidated revenue growth was 35%, while streaming ARPU growth was 12%. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above our guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4’19. EPS amounted to $1.47 vs. $0.89 and included a $171 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Our Euro bonds provide us with a small natural hedge for our growing European revenues. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, our guidance forecast was our most accurate in recent history. 1In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. On a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a meaningful impact on paid net adds. However, revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. With more revenue, we’ll continue to invest to improve our service to further strengthen our value proposition. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We’re making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress. For Q4, we’re expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We’re forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. As we outline in more detail below, our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. 2We’re on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we’ll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we’ve delivered each year since 2017. As we’ve said previously, large swings in F/X could lead to some variations from our steady annual margin progression, partially because we don’t buy derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars. Content We strive to program Netflix with the best variety of high quality content across many genres (scripted series, films, docs, comedy specials, unscripted TV, kids & family, anime, etc.). Our ambitious approach reflects our goal to satisfy the entertainment desires of our 158m-plus members and to attract as many of the hundreds of millions of non-members as we can. To accomplish this, we need great breadth of quality content because people have very diverse tastes. If you think about your own habits, you’ll recognize that what you want to watch on a Friday night may differ from what you want to watch on Tuesday after a long day of work or what you want to watch with your family on Saturday morning or what you want to watch with your friends on Sunday afternoon. Now, multiply that by the billions of people on the planet and all the other factors that affect viewing preferences and you will have a sense of the breadth of programming necessary to be as successful as we desire. We have been moving increasingly to original content both because of the anticipated pullback of second run content from some studios and because our original content is working in the form of member viewing and engagement. We started first with English scripted TV series more than six years ago to great success. We continued in Q3 with Stranger Things Season 3 (the most watched season to ​ ​ date with 64m member households in its first four weeks). We also introduced new limited series like 3Unbelievable, one of our most thought provoking and highly viewed dramas (watched by 32m member ​ households in its first 28 days). We’re expanding our non-English language original offerings because they continue to help grow our penetration in international markets. In Q3, Season 3 of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist) became the ​​ ​ ​ ​ most watched show on Netflix across our non-English language territories with 44m households watching the new season in the first four weeks of release. Sintonia, our latest Brazilian original, was the ​ ​ second most watched inaugural season in Brazil. The Naked Director broke out as the biggest title launch ​ ​ for us in Japan and was also highly successful throughout Asia. Similarly, in India, we debuted the second season of Sacred Games, our most watched show in India. To date, we have globally released 100 ​ ​ seasons of local language, original scripted series from 17 countries and have plans for over 130 more in 2020. We also plan to expand our investment in local language original films and unscripted series. We’re also investing aggressively in original films and making great progress with improving results. Our original film slate in Q3 featured several solid hits like Secret Obsession (starring Brenda Song) and ​ ​ Otherhood (directed by Cindy Chupack in her feature directorial debut), which were watched by 40 ​ million and 29 million households in their first four weeks, respectively. Tall Girl, a new family film ​ ​​ starring Ava Michelle, was also a success with 41m households watching in the first 28 days. We expect that our Q4 film releases will continue to build and strengthen our film effort. Q4 film releases include Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman (with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci), Marriage Story (starring ​ ​ ​ ​ Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and The Two Popes (featuring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan ​ ​ Pryce), all of which have emerged as early Oscar frontrunners. We also have several big releases such as Dolemite is My Name (starring Eddie Murphy and featuring a breakout performance from Da'Vine Joy ​ ​ Randolph), 6 Underground (directed by Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds), The Laundromat, from ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ director Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman and The King (starring Timothée ​​ ​​ ​ Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton) as well as animated features Klaus and I Lost My Body. ​​ ​ ​ ​ Our goal is to have the quality of our slate rival the ambition of its scope. An example is Orange is the ​ New Black, which wrapped its final new season in Q3. The show was celebrated by fans and the media ​ for the groundbreaking role it played for Netflix and the culture at large; Time Magazine said “...’Orange is the New Black’ is the most important TV show of the decade.” Our very popular Ozark, ​ ​ Our Planet, Queer Eye, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and When They See Us led 40 Netflix original series ​ ​ ​ and films to a record 117 Emmy Nominations and 27 wins in 2019. With so many firms now looking to provide premium video content to consumers, it’s a great time to be a creator of content. Amazing content can be expensive. We don’t shy away from taking bold swings if we think the business impact will also be amazing. We don’t close every deal we chase and we don’t chase every deal on the table. And while not all projects that we do pursue will work out, our large and growing subscription base helps enable us to try many approaches, while the size of our content budget (~$10 billion on P&L spend and ~$15 billion in cash content spend in 2019) insulates us from dependency on any single title. We’ll continue to learn as we go, while staying disciplined by assessing each opportunity individually, steadily marching up our operating margin and improving free cash flow. 4Product and Partnerships We seek to make it easier for future members to sign up and enjoy Netflix. To that end, we rolled out a lower priced mobile plan in India in July and we’re pleased with the results. Our approach with pricing is to grow revenue and so far, uptake and retention on our mobile plan in India has been better than our initial testing suggested. This will allow us to invest more in Indian content to further satisfy our members. While still only a very small percentage of our total subscriber base, we’re continuing to test mobile-only plans in other markets. We continued to expand our partner-based bundle offerings, adding bundles with Sky Italia, Canal+ in France, KDDI in Japan and Izzi in Mexico this quarter. We just localized our service in Vietnamese, Hungarian and Czech so that more entertainment fans can enjoy thousands of hours of TV shows and films in their preferred language. We’ll continue to expand language coverage and accessibility. Competition We compete broadly for entertainment time. This means there are many competitive activities to Netflix (from watching linear TV to playing video games, for example). But there is also a very large market opportunity; today we believe we’re less than 10% of TV screen time in the US (our most mature market) and much less than that in mobile screen time. Many are focused on the “streaming wars,” but we’ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade. The upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV. While the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world. The launch of these new services will be noisy. There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we’ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. By way of example, our growth in Canada, where Hulu does not exist, is nearly identical to our growth in the US (where Hulu is very successful at about 30 million paid memberships). Our penetration in both markets below: 5We believe this is due to the big factor of streaming growing into linear TV plus the fact that streaming video services have mostly exclusive content libraries that make them highly differentiated from one another. In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and Discovery didn’t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience share from broadcast viewing. Content creation is booming around the world and everyone is vying for consumer attention. Over the next 10 years, many streaming services will grow viewing as streaming replaces linear TV. Our focus will continue to be on pleasing our members and growing engagement because that approach has served us well since 1997. Total viewing, as measured by various 3rd parties, is the best indicator of our relative success since it’s a signal of customer satisfaction, and few of the services will disclose streaming video revenue, and subscriber figures are hard to interpret (given bundles, discounts and other promotions). Our focused approach to date has driven meaningful growth in our membership base and engagement. We did well during the first decade of streaming. We’ve been preparing for this new wave of competition for a long time. It’s why we started investing in originals in 2012 and expanded aggressively ever since - across programming categories and countries with an ambition to share stories from the world to the world. In Q4, with The Crown, The Witcher, Klaus, The Irishman, The Two Popes, 6 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Underground, and many other amazing titles launching, we’re ready to compete to earn consumers’ ​ attention and viewing. 6Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash used in operating activities in Q3’19 was -$502 million vs. -$690 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 in Q3 totaled -$551 million vs. -$859 million in Q3’18. For the full year 2019, we’re still expecting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we’re expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. As we move slowly toward FCF positive, our plan is to continue to use the high yield market in the interim to finance our investment needs. Next Year Reporting Starting with our Q4’19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region, which is how we think about our business. Our four regions are Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM), and the US and Canada (UCAN). UCAN is roughly 90% US and 10% Canada. Under this new reporting format, we’ll only provide membership guidance for global paid memberships for the next quarter with each earnings report. ​ As we self-produce and license more original content that has global rights, we are finding US vs. international segment contribution margin reporting is becoming less useful internally. We’ll stop reporting on it in January 2020 and continue to focus on global operating margin as our primary profitability metric. As a reminder, we’ll no longer report free trial members beginning in 2020 as we informed you in our Q3’18 investor letter. ​ ​ 1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 7Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: July 2019, April 2019, January 2019, ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ October 2018, July 2018, April 2018, January 2018, October 2017. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ October 16, 2019 Earnings Interview, 3pm PDT Our video interview with Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm ​ ​ PDT today.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated 8that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
