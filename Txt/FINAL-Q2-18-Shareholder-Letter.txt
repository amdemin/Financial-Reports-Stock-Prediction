We had a strong but not stellar Q2, ending with 130 million memberships. Membership growth was 5.2m, the same as Q2 last year, but lower than our 6.2m forecast. Earnings, margins, and revenue were all in-line with forecast and way up from prior year. Internet video is growing globally and we are fortunate to be one of the leaders. In addition to succeeding commercially, we are starting to lead artistically in some categories, with our creators earning enough Emmy nominations this year to collectively break HBO’s amazing 17-year run. ​ ​ Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Streaming revenue in Q2 rose 43% year over year, driven by a 26% and 14% increase in average paid memberships and ASP, respectively. Operating margin of 11.8% expanded 720 bps year over year, resulting in 262% growth in operating income. EPS of $0.85 vs. $0.15 included an $85 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy, meaning in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance. This Q2, we over-forecasted global net additions which amounted to 5.2m vs. a forecast of 6.2m and flat compared to Q2 a year ago, as acquisition growth was slightly lower than we projected. Paid net adds totaled 5.5m in Q2, compared with 4.7m last year and forecast of 6.1m. US net adds of 0.7m (vs. guidance of 1.2m) were down vs. last year’s Q2-record 1.1m, but consistent with previous Q2 performance (0.5m in Q2’12, 0.6m in Q2’13, 0.6m in Q2’14, 0.9m in Q2’15, and 0.2m in Q2’16). Through the first six months of the year, our US net adds are slightly ahead of last year. Internationally, 4.5m net additions grew 8% year over year on broad market growth. Currency had a +$65 million impact on international revenue year over year (+13% international ASP growth on a FX neutral basis), but this positive impact was smaller than we had forecast 90 days ago as the US dollar strengthened meaningfully against many currencies since our Q1’18 earnings report in April. As a ​ reminder, we do not hedge our revenue with derivatives. Faster growth in international markets relative to the US creates a net revenue exposure to non-USD currencies. With the growth of our content production in 80 countries and expanding, we’ll move more of our operating costs to non-USD to provide a little more natural hedging but we anticipate we’ll still 2continue to have much more expense in USD than revenue. We slowly adjust pricing over time to mitigate forex moves over the longer term, but when currency movements are rapid, they will affect our near term operating margin. We’ll tend to outperform our near term operating margin targets on dollar weakness and underperform on dollar strength. For the full year 2018, current F/X rates have pushed our expectations on operating margin to be near the lower end of our 10-11% target range. We continue to expect steady growth in operating margin in 2019 and beyond. For Q3, we forecast global net adds of 5.0m (compared with 5.3m in Q3’17), with 0.65m and 4.35m in the US and international segment, respectively. Paid net adds are forecast to be 5.2m, up from 5.0m in Q3’17. Content Our broad slate of programming in Q2 highlights the diversity of programming we are providing. We debuted sci-fi action series Lost in Space, which we’ve renewed for another season. In addition, we ​ ​ released the second season of one of our biggest originals 13 Reasons Why, as well as Santa Clarita Diet, ​ ​ ​ ​ A Series of Unfortunate Events, Marvel’s Jessica Jones, La Casa de Papel (Money Heist), GLOW and ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Marvel’s Luke Cage. In original kids programming, Boss Baby: Back in Business became one of our ​​ ​ ​ ​ biggest kids series ever. We continue to ramp up our production of non-English originals. In Q2, we debuted season 2 of 3%, our ​ ​ sci-fi original from Brazil and premiered The Rain, our Danish original thriller which became one of our ​​ ​ ​ biggest non-English original productions yet, with viewing all over the world. This serves as another data point that our international originals can be important to specific countries and regions and also play well outside of their home markets. Late in the quarter, we launched Lust Stories, a new Indian original ​ ​ film, which has been a major success as our largest watched original in percentage terms in any individual market in its first month. Sacred Games, our first Indian original series, launched on July 6 and ​ ​ is off to a similarly strong start. We will follow Sacred Games up in India with Ghoul on August 24. ​ ​ ​ ​ We were honored last week with the most Emmy nominations of any network. The 112 Netflix nominations include five best series and best limited series nominations and are spread across 40 different scripted and unscripted series, TV movies, limited series, documentaries, talk shows, comedy specials and series for kids. This is a testament to the fantastic creators we work with across all forms of television. We are making good progress with our original feature films. As traditional exhibition focuses increasingly on superheroes and sequels, our on demand service allows us to serve a wide variety of tastes. For example, in Q2, we had success with several romantic comedies such as Set It Up, starring ​ ​ ​ ​ Lucy Liu, Zoey Deutch, Taye Diggs and Glen Powell and The Kissing Booth, which peaked at #4 on IMDB’s ​ ​ chart of most popular movies, behind only Deadpool 2, The Avengers: Infinity War and Solo: A Star Wars ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Story. Kissing Booth and Set it Up have been watched and loved by tens of millions of Netflix members ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ and the young stars of these films have seen their social media followings grow from a few thousand into the millions in the weeks following release. Of course, we also produce big event movies as well and we recently announced that Michael Bay, one of the most commercially successful action directors, will make his next film, Six Underground (starring Ryan Reynolds) for Netflix. Bay joins Martin Scorsese, ​ ​ 3Alfonso Cuaron, Susanne Bier, Paul Greengrass, Chris Columbus and many other top directors who are making their next feature films for Netflix. Product and Partnerships We continue to invest in our mobile experience. Last week, we unveiled our “Smart Downloads” feature on Android for members that use our offline mode, which is particularly popular in emerging markets. Now, when members finish watching a downloaded episode, it will be automatically deleted and the next episode will be automatically downloaded. Smart Downloads works only when the device is connected to WiFi so cellular data plans won’t be used and device storage won’t be affected since the last watched episode will always be deleted first before the next episode is downloaded. Members also have the option to toggle this feature on and off. We are expanding our partner-based bundle offerings, announcing deals with Telefonica in Spain and Latin America as well as KDDI in Japan. While the majority of our acquisition happens by consumers signing up with us directly, bundles continue to be a high-performing additional acquisition channel. We expect to continue to add such deals with partners around the world. Competition YouTube and Netflix are two leading global (ex-China) internet entertainment services. HBO and Disney are evolving to focus on internet entertainment services. Amazon and Apple are investing in content as part of larger ecosystem subscriptions. Each of these firms has unique content and is striving to find the best creators from around the world to entertain its viewers. There has never been a better time to be a creator or consumer of content. We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties to have attractive offerings. We anticipate more competition from the combined AT&T/Warner Media, from the combined Fox/Disney or Fox/Comcast as well as from international players like Germany’s ProSieben and Salto in France. Our strategy is to simply keep improving, as we’ve been doing every year ​ ​ in the past. Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q2 totaled -$559 million vs. -$608 million in the year ago quarter. We continue to anticipate FCF of -$3 to -$4 billion for the full year 2018, which implies that our content cash spending will be weighted to the second half of 2018. During Q2, we completed our latest bond deal, raising $1.9 billion. At the end of Q2, our gross debt balance stood at $8.4 billion and we had a cash balance of $3.9 billion and a $500 million undrawn credit facility. Our debt-to-EV is currently about 5%. While interest rates have risen and the federal tax rate is now lower (reducing the tax shield on interest costs), we judge that our after-tax cost of debt continues to be lower than our cost of equity, so we anticipate that we’ll continue to finance our capital needs in the high yield market. 4Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: April 2018, January 2018, October 2017, ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ July 2017, April 2017, January 2017, October 2016, July 2016. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Earnings Interview, 3pm PST, July 16, 2018 Our video interview with Todd Juenger of Bernstein will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm PST today. ​ ​ Questions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to todd.juenger@bernstein.com.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
