12  Financial Performance    Our U.S. member base grew to more than 36 million on the strength of our ever-improving content  offering, including Orange is the New Black Season 2.   For Q3, we expect about 1.3 million net additions,  comparable to Q3’13 in which we premiered Orange Season 1.  We are pleased our net additions in the  U.S. remain on par with last year.       Our U.S. contribution margin expanded 460 bps y/y to 27.1%, as revenue continued to grow faster than  spending on content and marketing.  As previously mentioned, we’ll re-evaluate our current 400 bps y/y  margin improvement target once we achieve a 30% contribution margin sometime next year.  The three  models we are evaluating are 400, 200, and 100 basis points margin improvement per year over the  next few years.      Outside the U.S., we generated continued growth in all of our markets.  We ended Q2 with 13.8 million  international members, growing 78% y/y.  In September, we’ll be launching Netflix in Germany, France,  Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg.  This launch into markets with over 60 million  broadband households will significantly increase our European presence and raise our current  international addressable market to over 180 million broadband households, or 2x the number of  current U.S. broadband households.    Our international contribution loss of ($15.3) million has been rapidly approaching contribution  profitability as we see improvements across all existing markets.  Our broad success from Argentina to  Finland has convinced us to further invest aggressively in global expansion.  Our European expansion  this quarter will add new expenses to the segment, so we expect a consolidated contribution loss of  ($42) million for the international segment in Q3.  Even after our upcoming expansion in Europe, we’ll  only address about one-third (271 million of 728 million1 ) of current global broadband households,  providing a great opportunity to build on our international success beyond 2014.  As explained in our  Long Term Letter, our plan remains to run at about global break-even to fund investment in global  expansion.      In May, we raised prices modestly in most of our markets for new members on our two screens at-a- time HD plan, and introduced a one screen at-a-time, standard definition plan across our markets.  Our  two screen HD plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new members.  We expect ARPU  to rise slowly as members at the new prices grow as a percentage of total membership.  There was  minimal impact on membership growth from this price change.                                                        1 SNL Kagan   3    Content    Original Series     The release of Orange is the New Black Season 2 has been every bit the global media event we had  hoped for; critically acclaimed and embraced by a fervent and growing fan base.  In its first month,  Orange became the most watched series in every Netflix territory, with many members either watching  for the first time or re-watching Season 1, in addition to the 13 new episodes of Season 2.    Earlier this month, Netflix original series and documentaries received 31 Emmy nominations, more than  double the 14 we received in our first year of releasing original programming. In its first year of  eligibility, Orange received 12 nominations, more than any other comedy series, while nominations for  House of Cards grew from 9 last year to 13 this year. Notably, these two shows were nominated for  Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Drama Series while The Square, which received 4  nominations, is up for Outstanding Documentary. It is quite rare for a single network to receive  nominations in all three of these categories as well as Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead  Actress for both drama (Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright for House of Cards) and comedy (Ricky Gervais  for Derek and Taylor Schilling for Orange.)     Hemlock Grove debuted July 11 and has already begun to build on its Season 1 audience. We have been  very pleased with the second season of Derek that launched in May and with the launch of our latest  original documentary The Battered Bastards of Baseball.     In the coming weeks, we will premiere the all new 4th and final season of The Killing (8/1) and a new  adult animated comedy BoJack Horseman (8/22).  Also in August, we will release Mission Blue (8/15)  from the Oscar-winning director of The Cove, Fisher Stevens.     Reflecting the increasingly global nature of the Netflix service, we now have original series in production  around the world, involving some of the best storytellers working in television and film today. Marco  Polo, a historical adventure from Executive Producer Harvey Weinstein, is shooting in Kazakhstan and  Malaysia.  In New York there is Marvel’s Daredevil, the first of our original series from Marvel Television,  as well as the already eagerly-anticipated third season of Orange is the New Black; while in Baltimore,  production is underway on the third season of House of Cards.  In the Florida Keys, the creators of  Damages (Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman, and Todd Kessler) are shooting a dark family thriller with an  ensemble cast led by Kyle Chandler, Sissy Spacek, Sam Shepard, Linda Cardellini, Ben Mendelsohn, and  Norbert Leo Butz.  Sense8, a mind-bending series from the Wachowskis (The Matrix trilogy, Cloud Atlas)  and J. Michael Straczynski (Babylon 5), began production in San Francisco last month, is now in Chicago,  and will shoot in many international locations this year.     4  In August, production begins in Los Angeles on Grace and Frankie, a comedy led by Jane Fonda, Lily  Tomlin, Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston; and in Colombia, Brazilian director José Padilha (Elite Squad,  Robocop) will begin filming Narcos with an all-star international cast led by Wagner Moura.    During the quarter, we announced our first-ever talk show, hosted by Chelsea Handler, the popular  comedian and best-selling author.  As with scripted programming, but unlike news or sports, fewer  people are watching talk shows live and are instead watching stacked episodes on DVR or online in the  days and weeks following initial airing.  Our intent is to produce a show with Handler and her team that  reflects this shift to on-demand enjoyment and that will appeal to a global audience.  Handler recently  taped her first special for Netflix -- a stand-up show that’s been sold out across the U.S., the U.K. and  Ireland -- and will produce four more in 2015 before we launch the talk show in early 2016.    Marketing    In Q2 we focused our marketing on the launch of the second season of Orange is the New Black in each  of our markets.  This campaign represents our largest content marketing push to date and we are  pleased with the reaction from fans.  Social media sentiment was overwhelmingly positive and search  volume validated that we had a big hit on our hands.  Season 3 next year should be even bigger.    Our Netflix brand advertising continues to resonate with consumers, highlighting the fun ways people’s  lives are enriched when they watch something great. Our well-received You’ve Got to Get it To Get It  campaign in Canada was extended with three new ads “Airport”, “Test Results”, and “Proposal” this  quarter. We ran the first ad in the campaign, “Pep Talk”, during the NHL playoffs and were delighted  when New York Rangers head coach Alain Vigneault picked up the joke during a pre-game press  conference, leading the NHL Network to interview the coach from our ad.    Another successful example of our brand advertising is our Viva Netflix campaign in Mexico which began  with “Abuelita,” featuring a fun take on local family viewing habits, quickly followed by  “Oribe” in which  Mexico’s star striker returns home from the World Cup slightly earlier than his spouse expected.    In Q2 we updated our logo from the red block with white letters to the cleaner red letters.  We were  pleased to execute this transition with the minimum of distraction.                5  In-Store Gift Cards Coming This Fall    We are introducing physical gift cards in select stores in the U.S., Canada,  Mexico, and Germany starting later this year.  In mature markets, gift cards will  extend our brand presence and make it easier to access Netflix. In newer  markets, gift cards help build the brand and provide an easier alternative for  consumers to join Netflix in markets with developing online payments.        Product    MVPD Set-Top Boxes    The Netflix app on Virgin Media set-top boxes in the U.K. continues to be a compelling streaming  experience that delivers above-median viewing and satisfaction.  We continue to gain traction in our  international markets with set-top box integration and, in the U.S., launched the Netflix app on the TiVo  platform with several regional MVPDs including Suddenlink, RCN, Grande and Atlantic Broadband during  the quarter.  MVPDs would rather their customers’ use Netflix on their set-top and remote than use  Netflix on Internet set-tops such as Apple TV, partially because that drives the pay-per-view  consumption for the respective set-top owner.      Android TV Platform     The Netflix app for Google's Android TV platform will appear on TVs from Sony, Sharp, and others in the  coming months. Widespread adoption of Android TV can reduce the number of different platforms we  need to support to ensure Netflix is broadly available on Smart TVs delivering a consistently first-rate  experience, no matter the vendor. Android TV incorporates Google's "cast" feature, allowing content  discovery on mobile devices and laptops with streaming delivered to the big screen.    Smart TV growing in Latin America    Post World Cup, the number of Smart TVs used for Netflix viewing in Latin American countries is at a  new high; in fact, the percentage of viewing from Smart TVs in Latin America is higher than any other  region we serve.  Members accessing Netflix on a big screen generally watch more and retain better  than members using smaller devices.    UHD 4K Video Quality    We are now streaming flagship content in UHD 4K to members with 4K Smart TVs, putting Netflix at the  leading edge of high-quality AV delivery. Already, Samsung, LG, and Sony have in retail around the world  6  4K Smart TVs, and House of Cards Season 2 and all seasons of Breaking Bad are now available for  streaming in the new format.  Content available to stream in 4K will grow steadily as several of our  original series are or will be shooting in 4K, including Marco Polo, Sense8, and Narcos.  UHD 4K will be an  Internet-centric format as linear TV will be late to switch their networks to UHD 4K.   Strong Net Neutrality  Our focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, is about preventing large ISPs from  holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance to extract payments from us, other Internet  content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent.  Our policy goals are for the FCC to not sanctify paid prioritization, and for the DOJ/FCC to block the  merger of Comcast/TWC, or at the very least, to require as condition to approving the merger that the  combined entity be prevented from charging for interconnection.  6.3 Million U.S. DVD Memberships  Our DVD-by-mail business continues to satisfy 6.3 million members.  Contribution profit for the segment  was $92.8 million in the quarter, as expected, and we anticipate $90 million for Q3.  A year ago in Q2,  we lost 475k DVD memberships.  In Q2 this year it was only 391k.   DVD and Blu-ray offer amazing and  comprehensive selection that keeps a core membership uniquely satisfied.

Summary We have a huge global opportunity ahead and a lot of challenges too.  We are thrilled for the creators of  our original series and documentaries who earned 31 Emmy nominations this year, and whose  incredible work is being enjoyed by many of our 50 million members.  7  Sincerely,                                                                                           Reed Hastings, CEO      David Wells, CFO                                                                                                                         21st July 2014 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview at 2 p.m. Pacific  Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  8  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance; content  offerings; marketing; gift cards; device and platform integration; member growth domestically and  internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, average revenue per subscriber, contribution  profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international  operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash  flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could  cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service  disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, widespread consumer adoption  of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward- looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our  Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.   The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance  will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our  Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to  reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                 9 Netflix, Inc.
