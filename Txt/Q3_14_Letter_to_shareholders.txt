Last quarter we added over 3 million members, ending Q3 with 53.1 million global members and $1.22 billion in revenue. We are forecasting adding another 4 million members in Q4, ending 2014 with over 57 million global members. Around the world, people are discovering the joy of Internet TV. With an incredible variety of original series, films and exclusive licensed content arriving on Netflix in the coming quarters, we will continue to thrill our members and expand our membership.

Domestic streaming revenue of $877 million, in-line with forecast, grew 25% y/y and faster than membership due to the expansion of ASP from the price changes implemented in Q2. We added two million members internationally, to end the quarter with 15.84 million members, with lower net adds than our forecast, but higher than prior year. International revenue of $346 million, in- line with forecast, grew 89% y/y, and faster than membership, again due to the expansion of our ASP. As a reminder, we provide you our internal forecast for the current quarter. For the prior three quarters, we under-forecasted membership growth. This quarter we over-forecasted membership growth. We’ll continue to give you our internal forecast for the current quarter, and it will be high some of the time and low other times. Separate from forecast variability, year on year net additions in the US were down (1.3 million in Q3 2013 to 1 million in Q3 2014). As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago. Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth, other things being equal, and this is manifested more clearly in higher adoption markets such as the US. In hindsight, we believe that late Q2 and early Q3 the impact of higher prices appeared to be offset for about two months by the large positive reception to Season Two of Orange is the New Black. We remain happy with the price changes and growth in revenue and will continue to improve our service, with better content, better streaming and better choosing. The effect of slightly higher prices is factored into our Q4 forecast. Since our per-member viewing and retention in the US are as strong as ever, we don’t think increased competition from piracy, TV Everywhere, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Hulu, etc, is a major factor. There is no change to our view on the long term attractiveness and US market size of Internet television, and no change to our view of the ultimate size of our US membership. We are forecasting Q4 US contribution margin to increase almost 500 basis points on a y/y basis, but to decrease slightly sequentially, as it did last year from Q3 to Q4, due to significant sequential increases in content and marketing expense. In September, we had a very successful launch in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, adding about 66 million1 broadband households to our addressable market. In recent days, our app has gone live on set-top boxes from SFR in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany, and 1 SNL Kagan 2we expect deployments this quarter from Orange and Bouygues in France, and Belgacom in Belgium. We’ve had more success, more quickly, with MVPD set-top boxes in these new markets than anywhere else in the world. As expected, we have a full quarter of new market expenses weighing on our international contribution margins in Q4, increasing contribution loss from Q3 to Q4. Our international markets launched prior to this year (Canada 4 years ago through Netherlands 1 year ago) are now collectively profitable on a contribution basis and will continue to help us fund new markets. Moreover, contribution margin from our first expansion market, Canada, now approximates the US. Starting in January, we have to pay higher VAT in most of Europe due to changes in European law (country of origin to country of destination). We will absorb these increases rather than pass them on to our members. This absorption will be reflected in slightly lower international contribution margin/profit starting in Q1 than we would otherwise have. Given how well our international expansion has performed, we intend substantial further expansion in 2015, consistent with our stated strategy. US contribution margin increases beyond 30% Our US contribution margin grew about 500 bps to 28.6% for Q3. After achieving 30% contribution margin, likely in Q1 or Q2 of next year, we will seek to grow margins an average of 200 basis points per year for the following years. Ideally, we will achieve 40% contribution margin five years after achieving 30%. This increase in our domestic contribution margin gives us room to increase content spending as we grow, as well as substantial domestic profitability. Content In Q3, we launched several new original series, documentaries and comedy specials, while ensuring future access to one of the most successful and globally appealing series of the North American fall TV season, Gotham. In our second year of qualification as a programmer, Netflix took home seven Emmy awards. Original Series BoJack Horseman marked our expansion into the popular adult animated comedy genre. In the past, we’ve licensed back seasons of already successful series like Archer, Futurama, and Bob’s Burgers. BoJack Horseman, starring Will Arnett, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris, drew more viewers in its first few weeks than any of these established network shows over a comparable period on Netflix, confirming for us the value of expanding into original series. TV Guide wrote that BoJack Horseman was the “funniest show of the fall” and we are now in production on season two for 2015. In Q3, we also launched a second season of Hemlock Grove and an original 4th and final season of The Killing. Both shows have been well received globally. We are now in pre-production of the final season 3of Hemlock Grove. We also premiered two acclaimed British series in North America, Happy Valley (in US and Canada) and Peaky Blinders (US only). We are looking forward to the December 12 release of our next major original series Marco Polo, an epic, cinematic tale of power, adventure and betrayal. We are currently in production on nine Netflix original series around the world and during the quarter announced a new comedy series, Love, from Judd Apatow, premiering in 2016. Original Documentary, Kids and Comedy Beyond scripted series, we launched three original documentaries in the quarter, Battered Bastards of Baseball, Mission Blue and Print the Legend. These documentaries have grown in audience reach and have positioned Netflix as a significant player in a category that attracts some of the most loyal and intense viewers. Finishing off the year, we will release E-Team, a powerful journalistic film from Oscar winning director Ross Kauffman and Katy Chevigny, and Virunga, a riveting film about the tensions over one of Africa’s best known national parks and the home of the mountain gorillas. Netflix continues to be a key destination for kids and families. We now offer members 75 kids series that are each delighting more than 2 million viewers on Netflix. More than a dozen of these series, many of them exclusive to Netflix, reach over 5 million viewers. During the quarter, we announced a partnership with Saban Brands to reboot the popular Popples animated series, with Rainbow Studios to extend their Winx Club stories and with storied producer Avi Arad and 41 Entertainment to produce a CGI film and series with a new take on the origin story of King Kong. In Q4, we will launch on Netflix the premiere episodes of two original series from DreamWorks Animation, the return of the beloved kids franchise Veggie Tales and All Hail King Julien, based on the popular character from Madagascar. Last week, Chelsea Handler’s Uganda Be Kidding Me Live arrived globally on Netflix to strong viewing and rave reviews. Next year, Chelsea will create four comedy documentaries for Netflix with her new take on the traditional talk show to follow in 2016. In Q3, Jim Jeffries brought his latest stand-up show to Netflix members, while this quarter, our members will enjoy new material from Chelsea Peretti (Brooklyn Nine Nine) , Bill Burr, Wyatt Cenac (The Daily Show) and the legendary Bill Cosby. Original Films On August 28, 2015, we will release our first Netflix original film, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend. A big budget continuation of the beloved 2000 Oscar-nominated film, it will debut simultaneously on select global IMAX screens and in Ultra HD 4k on Netflix, offering consumers the option to see this beautiful action film how and when they want. Separately, we announced plans to release only on Netflix four new Adam Sandler feature comedies, beginning in early 2016. Sandler is a true global movie star, grossing over $3 billion over the last twenty years, and generating huge viewing across all Netflix territories. We are investing in original films because doing so can be favorable economically compared to current Pay TV deals and is consistent with the desires of the global on- 4demand generation to enjoy new movies without having to wait for months after they debut in US theaters. Multi-territory Television Licensing In Q3, we secured second window rights from Warner Bros. Television for the Fox series Gotham in all current and planned Netflix territories. This historic deal will deliver the series to Netflix members soon after the broadcast completion of each season and ensures that Netflix will be the only subscription video service in these territories to offer the Batman origin series, commercial free and on demand in full season presentations. In our just launched territories in Europe, Netflix debuted as original series the Emmy-winning Fargo from MGM Television as well as From Dusk Till Dawn from El Rey and Penny Dreadful from CBS Television. These deals ensure our international members access to hit US television series without having to wait the months or years imposed by traditional TV models and should help to reduce piracy in those markets. Product Improved Laptop Streaming We are midway through switching to native HTML5 streaming for our laptop players, eliminating downloads (of Silverlight) and improving the consumer proposition with a smoother playback experience and longer battery life. This has been a successful four-year effort to get strong DRM integrated into the major browsers. Set-top Boxes Using the same techniques we developed to get on hundreds of different Blu-ray players and Smart TVs, we are now able to support a wide variety of MVPD set-top devices with an outstanding and updatable application. The Virgin/TiVo architecture was our first, which is a fairly modern system. We have since expanded to less high-end systems. Personal recommendations We have continued to improve our various recommendations systems, which match users to content based upon their preferences. We have rolled out a new visual search feature on the website and mobile platforms; it includes suggested viewing possibilities for searches that come up empty. 5Strong Net Neutrality We continue to focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, to prevent large ISPs from holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance in order to extract payments from us, other Internet content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent. We’ve increased awareness of this issue globally. Our efforts have helped generate a record breaking number of comments to the FCC in favor of net neutrality, while in Europe policymakers are beginning to focus on this issue. We will continue to advocate for the US government to block the merger of Comcast/TWC or, at the very least, prevent a combined entity from charging for interconnection. HBO Starting back in 2011 we started saying that HBO would be our primary long-term competitor, particularly for content. The competition will drive us both to be better. It was inevitable and sensible that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application. Many people will subscribe to both Netflix and HBO since we have different shows, so we think it is likely we both prosper as consumers move to Internet TV. DVD Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight about 6 million members, adding $89 million in contribution profit in Q3 and we anticipate close to the same in Q4. Operating Income Operating income nearly doubled y/y to $110 million despite our investment in international expansion. To support this expansion, we’ve invested in personnel growth in our corporate G&A functions which is the primary driver of both the y/y and sequential increase in G&A. Also contributing to the sequential increase was an increase in legal fees and one-time costs related to the launch of our new markets. 6Free Cash Flow & Content Obligations Historically, FCF tracked close to net income. As we’ve written previously, our increased use of cash for content, especially originals, will cause FCF to be materially less than net income, at least for the years ahead while we are increasing our investment in this area. In addition, in quarters like Q3 with big international territory launches, we have only a partial quarter of international content P&L expense but a full quarter of cash payments. We finished the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Our total streaming content obligations increased to $8.9 billion in the quarter from $7.7 billion at the end of Q2, which includes $3.6 billion on the balance sheet. The increase was driven by the multi-year commitments associated with our latest market launches in Europe and the continued expansion of our original programming, including our first original movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend. Reference For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: July 2014, April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013, October 2012. Summary The overwhelming consumer benefits of Internet television, in terms of convenience, control, selection, and price, continue to expand our opportunity. 7
