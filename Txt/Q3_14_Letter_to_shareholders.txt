Last quarter we added over 3 million members, ending Q3 with 53.1 million global members and $1.22 billion in revenue. We are forecasting adding another 4 million members in Q4, ending 2014 with over 57 million global members. Around the world, people are discovering the joy of Internet TV. With an incredible variety of original series, films and exclusive licensed content arriving on Netflix in the coming quarters, we will continue to thrill our members and expand our membership. Q3 Results and Q4 Expectations We added about a million new members in the US, ending Q3 with 37.22 million members, with lower net additions than our forecast and versus the prior year. Domestic streaming revenue of $877 million, in-line with forecast, grew 25% y/y and faster than membership due to the expansion of ASP from the price changes implemented in Q2. We added two million members internationally, to end the quarter with 15.84 million members, with lower net adds than our forecast, but higher than prior year. International revenue of $346 million, in- line with forecast, grew 89% y/y, and faster than membership, again due to the expansion of our ASP. As a reminder, we provide you our internal forecast for the current quarter. For the prior three quarters, we under-forecasted membership growth. This quarter we over-forecasted membership growth. We’ll continue to give you our internal forecast for the current quarter, and it will be high some of the time and low other times. Separate from forecast variability, year on year net additions in the US were down (1.3 million in Q3 2013 to 1 million in Q3 2014). As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago. Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth, other things being equal, and this is manifested more clearly in higher adoption markets such as the US. In hindsight, we believe that late Q2 and early Q3 the impact of higher prices appeared to be offset for about two months by the large positive reception to Season Two of Orange is the New Black. We remain happy with the price changes and growth in revenue and will continue to improve our service, with better content, better streaming and better choosing. The effect of slightly higher prices is factored into our Q4 forecast. Since our per-member viewing and retention in the US are as strong as ever, we don’t think increased competition from piracy, TV Everywhere, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Hulu, etc, is a major factor. There is no change to our view on the long term attractiveness and US market size of Internet television, and no change to our view of the ultimate size of our US membership. We are forecasting Q4 US contribution margin to increase almost 500 basis points on a y/y basis, but to decrease slightly sequentially, as it did last year from Q3 to Q4, due to significant sequential increases in content and marketing expense. In September, we had a very successful launch in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, adding about 66 million1 broadband households to our addressable market. In recent days, our app has gone live on set-top boxes from SFR in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany, and 1 SNL Kagan 2we expect deployments this quarter from Orange and Bouygues in France, and Belgacom in Belgium. We’ve had more success, more quickly, with MVPD set-top boxes in these new markets than anywhere else in the world. As expected, we have a full quarter of new market expenses weighing on our international contribution margins in Q4, increasing contribution loss from Q3 to Q4. Our international markets launched prior to this year (Canada 4 years ago through Netherlands 1 year ago) are now collectively profitable on a contribution basis and will continue to help us fund new markets. Moreover, contribution margin from our first expansion market, Canada, now approximates the US. Starting in January, we have to pay higher VAT in most of Europe due to changes in European law (country of origin to country of destination). We will absorb these increases rather than pass them on to our members. This absorption will be reflected in slightly lower international contribution margin/profit starting in Q1 than we would otherwise have. Given how well our international expansion has performed, we intend substantial further expansion in 2015, consistent with our stated strategy. US contribution margin increases beyond 30% Our US contribution margin grew about 500 bps to 28.6% for Q3. After achieving 30% contribution margin, likely in Q1 or Q2 of next year, we will seek to grow margins an average of 200 basis points per year for the following years. Ideally, we will achieve 40% contribution margin five years after achieving 30%. This increase in our domestic contribution margin gives us room to increase content spending as we grow, as well as substantial domestic profitability. Content In Q3, we launched several new original series, documentaries and comedy specials, while ensuring future access to one of the most successful and globally appealing series of the North American fall TV season, Gotham. In our second year of qualification as a programmer, Netflix took home seven Emmy awards. Original Series BoJack Horseman marked our expansion into the popular adult animated comedy genre. In the past, we’ve licensed back seasons of already successful series like Archer, Futurama, and Bob’s Burgers. BoJack Horseman, starring Will Arnett, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris, drew more viewers in its first few weeks than any of these established network shows over a comparable period on Netflix, confirming for us the value of expanding into original series. TV Guide wrote that BoJack Horseman was the “funniest show of the fall” and we are now in production on season two for 2015. In Q3, we also launched a second season of Hemlock Grove and an original 4th and final season of The Killing. Both shows have been well received globally. We are now in pre-production of the final season 3of Hemlock Grove. We also premiered two acclaimed British series in North America, Happy Valley (in US and Canada) and Peaky Blinders (US only). We are looking forward to the December 12 release of our next major original series Marco Polo, an epic, cinematic tale of power, adventure and betrayal. We are currently in production on nine Netflix original series around the world and during the quarter announced a new comedy series, Love, from Judd Apatow, premiering in 2016. Original Documentary, Kids and Comedy Beyond scripted series, we launched three original documentaries in the quarter, Battered Bastards of Baseball, Mission Blue and Print the Legend. These documentaries have grown in audience reach and have positioned Netflix as a significant player in a category that attracts some of the most loyal and intense viewers. Finishing off the year, we will release E-Team, a powerful journalistic film from Oscar winning director Ross Kauffman and Katy Chevigny, and Virunga, a riveting film about the tensions over one of Africa’s best known national parks and the home of the mountain gorillas. Netflix continues to be a key destination for kids and families. We now offer members 75 kids series that are each delighting more than 2 million viewers on Netflix. More than a dozen of these series, many of them exclusive to Netflix, reach over 5 million viewers. During the quarter, we announced a partnership with Saban Brands to reboot the popular Popples animated series, with Rainbow Studios to extend their Winx Club stories and with storied producer Avi Arad and 41 Entertainment to produce a CGI film and series with a new take on the origin story of King Kong. In Q4, we will launch on Netflix the premiere episodes of two original series from DreamWorks Animation, the return of the beloved kids franchise Veggie Tales and All Hail King Julien, based on the popular character from Madagascar. Last week, Chelsea Handler’s Uganda Be Kidding Me Live arrived globally on Netflix to strong viewing and rave reviews. Next year, Chelsea will create four comedy documentaries for Netflix with her new take on the traditional talk show to follow in 2016. In Q3, Jim Jeffries brought his latest stand-up show to Netflix members, while this quarter, our members will enjoy new material from Chelsea Peretti (Brooklyn Nine Nine) , Bill Burr, Wyatt Cenac (The Daily Show) and the legendary Bill Cosby. Original Films On August 28, 2015, we will release our first Netflix original film, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend. A big budget continuation of the beloved 2000 Oscar-nominated film, it will debut simultaneously on select global IMAX screens and in Ultra HD 4k on Netflix, offering consumers the option to see this beautiful action film how and when they want. Separately, we announced plans to release only on Netflix four new Adam Sandler feature comedies, beginning in early 2016. Sandler is a true global movie star, grossing over $3 billion over the last twenty years, and generating huge viewing across all Netflix territories. We are investing in original films because doing so can be favorable economically compared to current Pay TV deals and is consistent with the desires of the global on- 45    demand generation to enjoy new movies without having to wait for months after they debut in US  theaters.  Multi-territory Television Licensing  In Q3, we secured second window rights from Warner Bros. Television for the Fox series Gotham in all  current and planned Netflix territories.  This historic deal will deliver the series to Netflix members soon  after the broadcast completion of each season and ensures that Netflix will be the only subscription  video service in these territories to offer the Batman origin series, commercial free and on demand in  full season presentations.   In our just launched territories in Europe, Netflix debuted as original series the Emmy-winning Fargo  from MGM Television as well as From Dusk Till Dawn from El Rey and Penny Dreadful from CBS  Television.  These deals ensure our international members access to hit US television series without  having to wait the months or years imposed by traditional TV models and should help to reduce piracy in  those markets.   Product  Improved Laptop Streaming  We are midway through switching to native HTML5 streaming for our laptop players, eliminating  downloads (of Silverlight) and improving the consumer proposition with a smoother playback  experience and longer battery life.  This has been a successful four-year effort to get strong DRM  integrated into the major browsers.      Set-top Boxes  Using the same techniques we developed to get on hundreds of different Blu-ray players and Smart TVs,  we are now able to support a wide variety of MVPD set-top devices with an outstanding and updatable  application.  The Virgin/TiVo architecture was our first, which is a fairly modern system.    We have since  expanded to less high-end systems.       Personal recommendations  We have continued to improve our various recommendations systems, which match users to content  based upon their preferences.  We have rolled out a new visual search feature on the website and  mobile platforms; it includes suggested viewing possibilities for searches that come up empty.        6    Strong Net Neutrality  We continue to focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, to prevent large ISPs from  holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance in order to extract payments from us, other  Internet content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent.   We’ve increased awareness of this issue globally.  Our efforts have helped generate a record breaking  number of comments to the FCC in favor of net neutrality, while in Europe policymakers are beginning  to focus on this issue.  We will continue to advocate for the US government to block the merger of Comcast/TWC or, at the  very least, prevent a combined entity from charging for interconnection.    HBO  Starting back in 2011 we started saying that HBO would be our primary long-term competitor,  particularly for content. The competition will drive us both to be better.  It was inevitable and sensible  that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application.  Many people will subscribe to  both Netflix and HBO since we have different shows, so we think it is likely we both prosper as  consumers move to Internet TV.      DVD  Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight about 6 million members, adding $89 million in  contribution profit in Q3 and we anticipate close to the same in Q4.    Operating Income  Operating income nearly doubled y/y to $110 million despite our investment in international expansion.   To support this expansion, we’ve invested in personnel growth in our corporate G&A functions which is  the primary driver of both the y/y and sequential increase in G&A.  Also contributing to the sequential  increase was an increase in legal fees and one-time costs related to the launch of our new markets.            7  Free Cash Flow & Content Obligations Historically, FCF tracked close to net income.  As we’ve written previously, our increased use of cash for  content, especially originals, will cause FCF to be materially less than net income, at least for the years  ahead while we are increasing our investment in this area.  In addition, in quarters like Q3 with big  international territory launches, we have only a partial quarter of international content P&L expense but  a full quarter of cash payments.  We finished the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash.    Our total streaming content obligations increased to $8.9 billion in the quarter from $7.7 billion at the  end of Q2, which includes $3.6 billion on the balance sheet.  The increase was driven by the multi-year  commitments associated with our latest market launches in Europe and the continued expansion of our  original programming, including our first original movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend.

Summary The overwhelming consumer benefits of Internet television, in terms of convenience, control, selection,  and price, continue to expand our opportunity.   8    Sincerely,                                                                                           Reed Hastings, CEO      David Wells, CFO                                                                                                                         October 15, 2014 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview today at 3 p.m.  Pacific Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance; content  offerings; device and platform integration; forecast variability; member growth domestically and  internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin  for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating  income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including,  without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to  compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations  in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service  Providers; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.  The Company provides internal forecast  numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers  based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                 10 Netflix, Inc.
