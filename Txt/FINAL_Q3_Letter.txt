Fellow shareholders,    In Q3, quarterly global streaming revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time (up 36% year over year),  helped by our strong content slate including ​Stranger Things​ and the second season of ​Narcos​. On a  constant currency basis, this represents 39% year-over-year revenue growth, a 400 basis point  acceleration from the last two quarters. Our summary results and forecast are below:             1  Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Global streaming revenue totaled $2.2 billion, of which 40% was generated abroad. Operating income  amounted to $106 million (compared with our $64 million estimate) while net income was $52 million  (vs. forecast of $22 million).   In Q3, we added 0.4 million members in the US vs. our forecast of 0.3 million and 3.2 million members  internationally vs. our forecast of 2.0 million.  Our over-performance against forecast (86.7m total  streaming members vs. forecast of 85.5m) was driven primarily by stronger than expected acquisition  due to excitement around Netflix original content.   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report  and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, we under forecasted member growth, while in Q2, it was the opposite.  For the first nine months of 2016, we’ve added 12 million global members, the same as in the first nine  months of 2015.  By the end of Q3’16, we had un-grandfathered 75% of the members that are being un-grandfathered  this year and the impact has been consistent with our expectations. ASP grew over 10% year-over-year  in both the US and international segments (excluding a $35 million F/X impact). With more revenue, we  can reinvest to further improve Netflix to attract new members from around the world, while continuing  to delight our existing customers.   Domestically, revenue rose 23% year over year, 480 basis points faster than Q2. US marketing expense  rose as a percentage of revenue as we spent to build awareness for our expanding number of original  titles. US contribution profit increased 38% year-over-year with contribution margin expanding to 36%,  slightly ahead of our 35% forecast.  In the international segment, we exceeded our internal projection for net adds as the acquisition impact  of our originals was greater than anticipated across many of our markets. F/X-neutral revenue rose 72%  and international contribution loss was flat sequentially at $69 million as content costs came in under  our forecast due partly to timing. We are investing in more content across multiple international  markets in Q4 and, as a result, we project international contribution loss to grow moderately to $75  million.   In September, we localized Netflix in Poland and Turkey. We began accepting payment in local currency  and added a local language user interface, subtitles and dubbing as well as some local content. We have  seen nice gains in viewing and retention and we’ll undertake other localization efforts in the coming  months and years.   For Q4, we forecast 5.2 million global net adds, with 1.45 million net adds in the US and 3.75 million new  members internationally. Our expectation for a moderate year-over-year decline in net adds reflects the  completion of un-grandfathering. We are pleased with the results thus far as we expect ASP to grow  12% from Q1’16 to Q4’16. Internationally, the initial demand from our launch in Spain, Portugal and Italy  in Q4’15 will also affect our year-over-year net adds comparison.   2  We will face a tough international net adds comparison in Q1’17 because of the initial membership  surge in Q1’16 tied to the launch of 130 additional territories.  As discussed, for the balance of 2016, we will continue to operate around break even, and then start  generating material global profits in 2017 and beyond, by marching up operating margins steadily for  many years.  Content  We kicked off Q3 with the release of ​Stranger Things​ on July 15 to both critical and audience ​acclaim​.  This nostalgic, supernatural thriller proved to be the ​blockbuster of the summer​ and is the kind of broad  appeal, cross demographic, and cross border sensation that we hope will distinguish Netflix original  content. ​Stranger Things​ is also notable as it is produced and owned by Netflix, which provides us with  more attractive economics and greater business and creative control. In August, we launched ​The Get  Down​, a highly stylized drama set in 1970s New York City, detailing the origins of hip-hop. We look  forward to releasing part two of season one next year.   Our hit series ​Narcos​ returned for season two in September to great success among critics and  audiences ​alike​. ​Narcos ​had a positive impact on member acquisition across all of our markets,  demonstrating the ability for our tentpole franchises to connect with audiences across the world. We  closed the quarter with ​Marvel’s Luke Cage​, the latest installment in our Marvel series, which will  continue with ​Iron Fist​ on March 17, 2017. We are also looking forward next year to ​The Defenders​, a  team-up of the characters from our first four Marvel series.   We are now in the fourth year of our original content strategy and are pleased with our progress. In  2017, we intend to release over 1,000 hours of premium original programming, up from over 600 hours  this year. The Internet allows us to reach audiences all over the world and, with a growing base of over  86 million members, there’s a large appetite for entertainment and a diversity of tastes to satisfy.   We are fortunate that our Internet-centric, on-demand, subscription-only business model allows us to  support programs for both mass and niche audiences alike. Our personalization algorithms help us  promote the right content to the right viewers. And since we are not shelf-space constrained nor reliant  on advertising, we have the luxury to tell all kinds of stories in less traditional ways. The growth of  Internet TV globally has ushered in a new golden age of content, with consumers everywhere enjoying  unprecedented access to amazing amounts of high quality programming.   With an expanding content budget (approximately $6 billion in 2017 on a P&L basis), we judge the  success of our portfolio of originals in several ways. For each series or film, we measure the impact on  acquisition and member engagement which, in turn, is correlated with retention. To determine relative  performance, we look at each title’s share of viewing compared with its share of our content budget. We  also take into account qualitative factors such as earned media coverage and awards, which enhance  our brand and our ability to attract talent for future projects. This year, we are thrilled to have won nine  Emmys (out of 54 nominations) across six different shows.   3  This past quarter, we announced a global pact with 20th Century Fox Studios to license ​The People vs.  O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story ​and ​Queen of the South​ and an agreement with The Walt Disney Co.  to license ​Quantico​ and ​American Crime​ in the US and Canada. We are also increasingly ensuring early  financing and sharing windows globally with original broadcasters for series like ​Star Trek: Discovery  from CBS, ​The Alienist ​from Paramount TV and the just-launched  ABC series ​Designated Survivor​ from  eOne.  Product and Partnerships  We continue to make progress with our MVPD partnerships. We are excited that the Netflix app will be  available across ​Liberty Global’s footprint​ beginning in the Netherlands later this year and expanding to  other countries in 2017. Partnerships like this and our integration on X1 with ​Comcast​ validate the  strength of our content and that we are additive to the current offerings of MVPDs. By working  together, MVPDs can sell richer Internet and TV packages, while consumers can more easily sign up for  and access Netflix, thus allowing Netflix and our partners to better serve our shared customers.  China  The regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging. We  now plan to license content to existing online service providers in China rather than operate our own  service in China in the near term. We expect revenue from this licensing will be modest. We still have a  long term desire to serve the Chinese people directly, and hope to launch our service in China  eventually.   Competition  We face immense competition for consumer screen time. Despite video gaming getting better, video  messaging and sharing improving, MVPD UI enhancements, YouTube growth, more SVOD services, and  other screen time competitors, Netflix continues to win both time and affection. We presume that  Amazon Prime Video will become as global as YouTube and Netflix this fall with the launch of the Jeremy  Clarkson show.  Our challenge is to continue to improve our service and content so that we better meet  consumer desires. Total screen time is quite large and growing as technology and content improve  globally.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q3, free cash flow was -$506 million vs. -$254 million in Q2’16 and -$252 million in the year ago  quarter. The increase in our free cash flow deficit reflects the growth of original content, which we are  increasingly producing and owning (rather than licensing). Self-produced shows like ​Stranger Things  require more cash upfront as we incur spending during the creation of each show prior to its completion  and release. In comparison, we generally pay on delivery for licensed originals like ​Orange is the New  Black​ and we pay over the term of the agreement for licensed non-originals (eg, ​Scandal​).    4  Over the long run, we believe self-producing is less expensive (including cost of capital) than licensing a  series or film, as we work directly with the creative community and eliminate additional overhead and  fees. In addition, we own the underlying intellectual property, providing us with global rights and more  business and creative control. Combined with the success of our portfolio of originals and the positive  impact on our member and revenue growth, we believe this is a wise investment that creates long term  value. Consequently, we plan on investing more, which will continue to weigh on free cash flow. We  expect Q4’16 FCF to be similar to Q3’16 FCF. Over time, we will be able to fund more of our investment  in programming through the growth in operating profit and margin already underway.  Streaming content obligations at quarter end were $14.4 billion, up $1 billion sequentially. The increase  reflects the addition of both new original and non-original content to our library as well as expanded  rights for our new territories.   We finished the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents. As we have often done over the past  few years, we plan to raise additional debt in the coming weeks. With a debt to total capitalization ratio  of about 5%, we remain underleveraged compared both to similar firms and to our view of an efficient  capital structure. Our 2025 bonds continue to ​trade well​.

Management believes that the non​-GAAP measure  of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves provides useful information as  this measure excludes effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes  that the non-GAAP financial measures of revenue and ASP growth on a constant currency basis are  useful in assessing underlying business performance excluding the effect of foreign currency rate  fluctuations.  Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics  because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay  debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-​GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, revenue,  operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other  financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these  non​-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.  Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding content investments; localization efforts; ASP;  profitability in 2017 and beyond; content releases and programming hours; our content budget; MVPD  partnerships; business plans for China; future capital raises and timing of such raises; domestic and  international net additions, and total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income and margin, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The  forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain  existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for  streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions  of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of  viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company  provides internal forecast numbers.
