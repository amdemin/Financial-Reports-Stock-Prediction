We achieved several major milestones in Q1: surpassing 40 million members in the US; 20 million internationally; and 60 million in total. Our original series, documentaries and comedy specials are being enthusiastically received, and member engagement is at an all-time high. Members streamed 10 billion hours in Q1, more evidence that consumers around the world are embracing the Internet TV revolution.

In the US, we gained 2.3 million new members, well above our expectation of 1.8 million due to both acquiring and retaining more members than forecast. Internationally, we added 2.6 million members versus a forecast of 2.25 million due to stronger growth than expected across a number of markets. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We think strong US growth benefited from our ever-improving content, including the launch of the third season of House of Cards and new shows Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Bloodline. In addition, retention continued to improve due to the growing value of our service overall. We are forecasting Q2 US net adds of 0.6 million, similar to the year ago quarter. During Q1, higher-than-forecast net adds and US revenue, coupled with lower-than-forecast content spending, resulted in a US contribution margin of 31.7%, ahead of our 30.1% estimate. In 2015, we expect to run ahead of our US contribution margin growth target of 200 bps/year on average because a greater share of global and original content costs will be absorbed by existing and new international territories as we continue to expand globally (since we allocate global content costs by geography). In addition, starting in Q2 we intend to shift some of our US marketing budget to international to take advantage of the substantial available growth opportunities. This, in the short term, drives down international contribution profits and drives up US contribution profits. We are still targeting 40% contribution margin in the US in 2020. Our international segment was fueled by continued strong growth across our 50+ countries as well as a successful March 24 launch in Australia and New Zealand, which adds about 8 million1 broadband households to our addressable market. In ANZ, Netflix benefited from high consumer awareness, a fervent fan base for original series like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and operator relationships with Optus and iiNet, the second and third largest broadband providers. We expect international Q2 net adds of 1.90 million, up 70% vs. last year. Later in 2015, we will launch additional markets, starting with Japan. The strong dollar hurt financial results during the quarter, negatively affecting International segment revenue (lower by $48 million y/y using Q1 2014 forex rates) which carried through into a $15M negative forex impact on international contribution loss. These forex headwinds offset better than expected subscriber growth to result in contribution losses close to our expectations. As a reminder, we absorbed on average 5% higher VAT rates across our European markets starting January 1. We’ll have a full quarter of content expenses in ANZ in Q2 and expect the international segment loss to grow to $101 million, increasing throughout the back half of 2015 as we expand to additional markets (consistent with what we’ve said). Our strong performance led to overall operating income that exceeded our projections ($97m actual versus $79m forecast). Net income was negatively affected by currency-related transaction losses 1 SNL Kagan 2included in other expense; excluding these forex losses, Q1 EPS would have been $0.77 vs. our $0.60 forecast and our actual EPS of $0.38. Content Our original content strategy is playing out as we hoped, driving lots of viewing in an economic way for Netflix while bolstering the positive perception of our brand and service around the world. House of Cards, in its third season, had its biggest launch yet in terms of viewers. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Tina Fey’s return to television, has been a hit, winning Rotten Tomatoes scores of 90%+ from both critics and viewers and our drama thriller, Bloodline starring Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn and Sissy Spacek, is performing on par with the first seasons of our other big drama shows. During the quarter, we announced new seasons for all three shows, as well as three new Netflix original films, Pee- Wee’s Big Holiday from Judd Apatow and Paul Reubens, Jadotville, from Irish director Richie Smyth and starring Jamie Dornan, and Beasts of No Nation from director Cary Fukunaga and starring Idris Elba. Beasts will premiere on Netflix later this year. We are delighted by the fan excitement and critical response around last Friday’s launch of Marvel’s Daredevil, the first of four series and a mini-series from our deal with Marvel Entertainment. The current quarter will also see the debut of Grace and Frankie starring legendary comedians Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, Sense8, an unbelievably cinematic and entertaining global dramatic thriller from the Wachowski siblings, and the third season of our groundbreaking Orange is The New Black.

Marketing We are increasingly spending on the promotion of our original content rather than emphasizing attributes of the Netflix brand and service that are now more familiar to consumers. Early tests in international markets suggest this content focus is aiding member acquisition. We are also spending a bigger proportion of our marketing dollars online. This allows us to more finely target audiences and to deliver the right marketing message to the right person at the right time, particularly on mobile devices. Product We plan to roll out an improvement to our TV UI in the second half of 2015. The enhancement will bring video playback forward into the browse experience. We are also developing improved ways to promote Netflix originals to our members, using our data to help identify which members would be most likely to enjoy each original title. Given our international rollout, we continue to add subtitles and UI languages for much of our content. Over the next year we’ll evolve from using HTTP to using Secure HTTP (HTTPS) while browsing and viewing content on our service. This helps protect member privacy, particularly when the network is insecure, such as public wifi, and it helps protect members from eavesdropping by their ISP or employer, who may want to record our members’ viewing for other reasons. 3Strong Net Neutrality We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points. In the US, we have been vocal advocates for, and are pleased with, recent action by the FCC to assure an open and neutral Internet under its Title II authority. In particular, we applaud the FCC for specifically addressing interconnection points. We hope this action serves as an example to regulators around the world looking to strengthen the innovative force of the Internet. Data caps inhibit Internet innovation and are bad for consumers. In Australia, we recently sought to protect our new members from data caps by participating in ISP programs that, while common in Australia, effectively condone discrimination among video services (some capped, some not). We should have avoided that and will avoid it going forward. Fortunately, most fixed-line ISPs are raising or eliminating data caps in line with our belief that ISPs should provide great video for all services in a market and let consumers do the choosing. Competition In the US, HBO began offering its $15 per month “HBO Now” service last week. As we have said in the past, Netflix and HBO are not substitutes for one another given differing content. We think both will continue to be successful in the marketplace, as illustrated by the fact that HBO has continued to grow globally and domestically as we have rapidly grown over the past 5 years. We view “Internet MVPD” offerings like the rumored Apple offering, Sony’s Playstation Vue and Dish’s Sling TV as more competitive to the current pay TV bundle than to Netflix which is lower cost, has exclusive and original content, and is not focused on live television. Piracy remains a considerable long-term threat, mostly outside the US. DVD Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to delight more than 5.5 million members and provided $85 million in contribution profit in Q1. The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and TV shows, remains appealing to a core user base and means that the tail on this business should be quite long. Free Cash Flow & Capital During the quarter, free cash flow totaled -$163 million, a step up from Q4 reflecting our growing original content investment. In February, we issued $1.5 billion in debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%, split between 7 and 10 year notes. We ended Q1 with $3.0 billion in cash & equivalents and short term investments. We will continue to invest aggressively in original content which is cash intensive. As we’ve said, our plan is to run around break-even globally through 2016, and to then deliver material global profits in 2017 and beyond. 4Stock Split As highlighted in our preliminary proxy, we are seeking shareholder approval for an increase in our authorized shares. If approved, we expect to recommend to our Board a stock split to make our stock more accessible.

Summary We are excited to see Internet TV catch hold across the world. We are at one of those wonderful moments when technology intersects with storytelling to create more choice and value for consumers. It’s great to be at the vanguard and we appreciate your support.
