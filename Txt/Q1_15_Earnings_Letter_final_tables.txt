We achieved several major milestones in Q1: surpassing 40 million members in the US; 20 million internationally; and 60 million in total. Our original series, documentaries and comedy specials are being enthusiastically received, and member engagement is at an all-time high. Members streamed 10 billion hours in Q1, more evidence that consumers around the world are embracing the Internet TV revolution. *Q1'15 EPS would have been $0.77 excluding a F/X lloss. Q4'14 Net Income/EPS includes a $39m / $0.63 benefit from a tax accrual release related to resolution of tax audit **Corresponds to our total known streaming content oobligations as defined in our financial statements and related notes in our most recently filed SEC Form 10-K 1                    2    Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast  We added a record 4.9 million new members globally in Q1, against our forecast of 4.1 million and prior  year of 4.0 million, bringing our total global streaming membership to 62.3 million. In the US, we gained  2.3 million new members, well above our expectation of 1.8 million due to both acquiring and retaining  more members than forecast.  Internationally, we added 2.6 million members versus a forecast of 2.25  million due to stronger growth than expected across a number of markets.   As a reminder, the quarterly  guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.   We think strong US growth benefited from our ever-improving content, including the launch of the third  season of House of Cards and new shows Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Bloodline.  In addition,  retention continued to improve due to the growing value of our service overall.  We are forecasting Q2  US net adds of 0.6 million, similar to the year ago quarter.  During Q1, higher-than-forecast net adds and US revenue, coupled with lower-than-forecast content  spending, resulted in a US contribution margin of 31.7%, ahead of our 30.1% estimate.  In 2015, we  expect to run ahead of our US contribution margin growth target of 200 bps/year on average because a  greater share of global and original content costs will be absorbed by existing and new international  territories as we continue to expand globally (since we allocate global content costs by geography).    In addition, starting in Q2 we intend to shift some of our US marketing budget to international to take  advantage of the substantial available growth opportunities. This, in the short term, drives down  international contribution profits and drives up US contribution profits.  We are still targeting 40%  contribution margin in the US in 2020.  Our international segment was fueled by continued strong growth across our 50+ countries as well as a  successful March 24 launch in Australia and New Zealand, which adds about 8 million1 broadband  households to our addressable market.  In ANZ, Netflix benefited from high consumer awareness, a  fervent fan base for original series like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and operator  relationships with Optus and iiNet, the second and third largest broadband providers.  We expect  international Q2 net adds of 1.90 million, up 70% vs. last year. Later in 2015, we will launch additional  markets, starting with Japan.   The strong dollar hurt financial results during the quarter, negatively affecting International segment  revenue (lower by $48 million y/y using Q1 2014 forex rates) which carried through into a $15M  negative forex impact on international contribution loss.  These forex headwinds offset better than  expected subscriber growth to result in contribution losses close to our expectations.  As a reminder, we  absorbed on average 5% higher VAT rates across our European markets starting January 1.  We’ll have a  full quarter of content expenses in ANZ in Q2 and expect the international segment loss to grow to $101  million, increasing throughout the back half of 2015 as we expand to additional markets (consistent with  what we’ve said).  Our strong performance led to overall operating income that exceeded our projections ($97m actual  versus $79m forecast). Net income was negatively affected by currency-related transaction losses                                                              1 SNL Kagan                      3  included in other expense; excluding these forex losses, Q1 EPS would have been $0.77 vs. our $0.60  forecast and our actual EPS of $0.38.  Content  Our original content strategy is playing out as we hoped, driving lots of viewing in an economic way for  Netflix while bolstering the positive perception of our brand and service around the world.  House of Cards, in its third season, had its biggest launch yet in terms of viewers. Unbreakable Kimmy  Schmidt, Tina Fey’s return to television, has been a hit, winning Rotten Tomatoes scores of 90%+ from  both critics and viewers and our drama thriller, Bloodline starring Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn and  Sissy Spacek, is performing on par with the first seasons of our other big drama shows. During the  quarter, we announced new seasons for all three shows, as well as three new Netflix original films, Pee- Wee’s Big Holiday from Judd Apatow and Paul Reubens, Jadotville, from Irish director Richie Smyth and  starring Jamie Dornan, and Beasts of No Nation from director Cary Fukunaga and starring Idris Elba.  Beasts will premiere on Netflix later this year.   We are delighted by the fan excitement and critical response around last Friday’s launch of Marvel’s  Daredevil, the first of four series and a mini-series from our deal with Marvel Entertainment. The current  quarter will also see the debut of Grace and Frankie starring legendary comedians Jane Fonda and Lily  Tomlin, Sense8, an unbelievably cinematic and entertaining global dramatic thriller from the Wachowski  siblings, and the third season of our groundbreaking Orange is The New Black.

Marketing  We are increasingly spending on the promotion of our original content rather than emphasizing  attributes of the Netflix brand and service that are now more familiar to consumers. Early tests in  international markets suggest this content focus is aiding member acquisition.  We are also spending a bigger proportion of our marketing dollars online. This allows us to more finely  target audiences and to deliver the right marketing message to the right person at the right time,  particularly on mobile devices.  Product  We plan to roll out an improvement to our TV UI in the second half of 2015. The enhancement will bring  video playback forward into the browse experience. We are also developing improved ways to promote  Netflix originals to our members, using our data to help identify which members would be most likely to  enjoy each original title. Given our international rollout, we continue to add subtitles and UI languages  for much of our content.   Over the next year we’ll evolve from using HTTP to using Secure HTTP (HTTPS) while browsing and  viewing content on our service.   This helps protect member privacy, particularly when the network is  insecure, such as public wifi, and it helps protect members from eavesdropping by their ISP or employer,  who may want to record our members’ viewing for other reasons.                        4  Strong Net Neutrality  We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access  they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at  interconnection points. In the US, we have been vocal advocates for, and are pleased with, recent action  by the FCC to assure an open and neutral Internet under its Title II authority.  In particular, we applaud  the FCC for specifically addressing interconnection points. We hope this action serves as an example to  regulators around the world looking to strengthen the innovative force of the Internet.  Data caps inhibit Internet innovation and are bad for consumers. In Australia, we recently sought to  protect our new members from data caps by participating in ISP programs that, while common in  Australia, effectively condone discrimination among video services (some capped, some not). We should  have avoided that and will avoid it going forward. Fortunately, most fixed-line ISPs are raising or  eliminating data caps in line with our belief that ISPs should provide great video for all services in a  market and let consumers do the choosing.  Competition  In the US, HBO began offering its $15 per month “HBO Now” service last week. As we have said in the  past, Netflix and HBO are not substitutes for one another given differing content. We think both will  continue to be successful in the marketplace, as illustrated by the fact that HBO has continued to grow  globally and domestically as we have rapidly grown over the past 5 years.    We view “Internet MVPD” offerings like the rumored Apple offering, Sony’s Playstation Vue and Dish’s  Sling TV as more competitive to the current pay TV bundle than to Netflix which is lower cost, has  exclusive and original content, and is not focused on live television.  Piracy remains a considerable long-term threat, mostly outside the US.  DVD  Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to delight more than 5.5 million members and provided  $85 million in contribution profit in Q1.  The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and  TV shows, remains appealing to a core user base and means that the tail on this business should be  quite long.  Free Cash Flow & Capital  During the quarter, free cash flow totaled -$163 million, a step up from Q4 reflecting our growing  original content investment.  In February, we issued $1.5 billion in debt at a weighted average interest  rate of 5.7%, split between 7 and 10 year notes. We ended Q1 with $3.0 billion in cash & equivalents  and short term investments. We will continue to invest aggressively in original content which is cash  intensive.   As we’ve said, our plan is to run around break-even globally through 2016, and to then deliver material  global profits in 2017 and beyond.      5  Stock Split  As highlighted in our preliminary proxy, we are seeking shareholder approval for an increase in our  authorized shares. If approved, we expect to recommend to our Board a stock split to make our stock  more accessible.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: January 2015, October 2014, July 2014,  April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013.  Summary  We are excited to see Internet TV catch hold across the world. We are at one of those wonderful  moments when technology intersects with storytelling to create more choice and value for consumers.  It’s great to be at the vanguard and we appreciate your support.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis  excluding foreign currency and the release of tax reserves provides useful information as these  measures exclude effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes  that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the  amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain  other activities.  However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a  substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash  provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.   Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding US contribution margin growth; international expansion,  deployment of marketing funds; content launches; product improvements; agreements with ISPs;  impact of competition; stock split; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total  and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and  DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per  share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on January 29, 2015.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should  anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and                      7  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to  update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                                  8 Netflix, Inc.
