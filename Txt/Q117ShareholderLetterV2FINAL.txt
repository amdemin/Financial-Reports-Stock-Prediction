Fellow shareholders,    In Q1, we surpassed $2.5 billion in quarterly streaming revenue and added 5 million members.  The  opportunity provided to us by the growth of the global internet is gigantic and our plan is to keep  investing as we increase membership, revenue and operating margins.           1  Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast   The quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report, and we strive for  accuracy. In Q1, there were no substantial variations from our January guidance forecast.   Due to content (primarily ​House of Cards ​season 5) moving from Q1 to Q2, we had higher operating  margins in Q1 (as forecasted) at 9.7% than our plan for the year (about 7%).  We forecast operating  margin at 4.4% in Q2, placing us on track to reach our 7% target for the full year.   The other effect of the content moves is lower net adds in Q1 compared to prior year (as expected) and  heavier net adds in Q2 compared to prior year (about double).  We have come to see these quarterly  variances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV. For the first half of  this year, for example, we expect to have 8.15 million net adds, compared to 8.42 million net adds in the  first half last year.   International net additions decreased 22% year over year, as we lapped our January 2016 launch of over  130 countries, and the accompanying early surge demand, in Q1 2016. Revenue for the international  segment grew 62% year over year, excluding a -$12 million impact from currency, while ASP rose 12%  year over year on a F/X neutral basis. Q1 was the first quarter of consolidated profit for our international  segment as profit growth in our more mature territories offset investments in newer markets.  Our  forward guidance shows that we intend to continue to invest internationally, projecting a small loss for  Q2.  We have high satisfaction and are rapidly growing in Latin America, Europe, and North America. We are  making good strides in improving our content offering to match local tastes in Asia, Middle East, and  Africa, but have much progress to make, like in Latin America a few years ago.   Our year-over-year streaming revenue growth is benefiting from a price change in mid 2016, and will  moderate over the course of the year to track membership growth more closely. We are seeing a small  but steady migration to our 4-stream, 4K-UHD-HDR video quality tier, which is our high end plan. That  will keep revenue growth slightly above membership growth, holding F/X constant.   For the last several years we’ve had flat operating margins due to established markets funding  international expansion with every spare dollar we had. Because of that, the major indicators of our  progress were member and revenue growth and US contribution margins. Starting this year, we can be  primarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics. The  summary table above has been reorganized to reflect that, while maintaining comparability to the past.   Content  With a growing member base spread across the world, we seek to please diverse tastes with a wide  breadth of content. The key releases this past quarter highlight this range of programming: ​A Series of  Unfortunate Events​, a dark comedy for the entire family, ​Santa Clarita Diet​, a “zom-com” starring Drew  Barrymore and ​Ultimate Beastmaster​, our first competition show which pits athletes from around the  globe against a fearsome 600-foot obstacle course.  2  In addition to these titles, on March 17, we debuted ​Marvel’s Iron Fist​, which has quickly become  another highly viewed Marvel series, and sets the stage for ​The Defenders​, which brings together all the  characters from the Marvel series later this year. A week later, we launched ​Ingobernable​, our second  Mexican series, starring Kate del Castillo, which has been very popular in Mexico. On the last day of Q1,  we unveiled ​13 Reasons Why​. Below is global search volume for several of our big launches over the last  year.      We have also stepped up our investment in stand up comedy which we believe can help grow our  business, like our original series. Early results are promising; the triumphant return of a comedy legend  in ​Dave Chappelle: Collection 1​ was our most viewed comedy special ever. We are also finding this to be  true in international markets as well, with comedian Gad Elmaleh’s ​Gad Gone Wild​, a breakout hit in  France last quarter.  Just ahead of the release of our third film from Adam Sandler, ​Sandy Wexler​, we announced the renewal  of our deal with Sandler to premiere an additional four films exclusively on Netflix around the world. We  continue to be excited by our Sandler relationship and our members continue to be thrilled with his  films. Since the launch of ​The Ridiculous 6​, Netflix members have spent more than half a billion hours  enjoying the films of Adam Sandler.   We recently hired ​Scott Stuber​ to lead our original films initiative. Our goal remains the same: to offer a  variety of new movies that will attract and delight members at better economics relative to licensing  movies under traditional windowing. Some of our early movies have been successful by this measure,  such as the Sandler movies and ​Siege of Jadotville​. Others, such as ​Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon:  Sword of Destiny​, have not.  Scott’s mandate is to increase both the portfolio and the percentage of  films that delight many of our members relative to the film’s cost.   3  Since our members are funding these films, they should be the first to see them. But we are also open to  supporting the large theater chains, such as AMC and Regal in the US, if they want to offer our films,  such as our upcoming Will Smith film ​Bright​, in theatres simultaneous to Netflix. Let consumers choose.   Product  As always, our product team has dozens of tests running in the endless quest for even higher member  satisfaction. One test that won conclusively last year and has now been rolled out to all members is our  new “thumbs-up thumbs-down” feedback model, replacing the 5-star model we have had from our DVD  days. The amount of usage we get with this new approach is over twice as many ratings.  With this  additional personal input, we’ll be able to improve personalization, making your front screen on Netflix  even more relevant.   A multi-year effort ahead is to have video replace still images in our user experience in ways that please  our members and help them choose what to watch. Video for choosing video is an obvious direction, but  doing it well through our interface takes judgment, creativity, and testing.  In April, we will add Thai and later in the quarter, Romanian and Hebrew, to the 24 languages we  currently support.   Marketing  As our slate of content expands, we’ll spend over $1 billion in 2017 marketing our content to drive  member acquisition. As part of this, we are investing more in programmatic advertising with the aim of  improving our ability to do individualized marketing at scale and to deliver the right ad to the right  person at the right time. Buttressing this activity is the substantial earned media coverage around the  Netflix brand, technology and content we generate globally through events and activities aimed at  journalists and social media influencers. We also market our content extensively to members through  our service and with our partners. For instance, we participated in Comcast’s Watchathon in April,  providing X1 subscribers unlimited access to Netflix for a week.   Competition  Our investors often ask us about ecosystem change, such as the advent in the US of virtual MVPDs (like  Sling, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, YouTube TV and Hulu’s forthcoming service). We believe VMVPDs  will likely be more directly competitive to existing MVPD services since they offer a subset of the same  channels at $30-$60 per month, and may appeal to a segment of the population that doesn’t subscribe  to a pay TV bundle. But we don’t think it will have much of an impact on us as Netflix is largely  complementary to pay TV packages. Our focus also is on on-demand, commercial free viewing rather  than live, ad-supported programming.   Additionally, investors ask us about Amazon’s move into NFL football.  That is not a strategy that we  think is smart for us since we believe we can earn more viewing and satisfaction from spending that  money on movies and TV shows.   4  Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow in Q1’17 was -$423 million vs. -$261 million in the year ago quarter and an improvement  from -$639 million in Q4’16. The growth in our original content means we continue to plan to have  around $2B in negative FCF this year.   We have a large market opportunity ahead of us and we’re optimizing long-term FCF by growing our  original content aggressively. Negative near-term FCF is the result of the big increases in our original  content, combined with small but growing operating margins. Since we want our operating margins to  grow slowly so we can spend enough to quickly grow revenue and original content, we anticipate  negative FCF to accompany our rapid growth for many years. Our operating margins are our key  indicator of improving global profitability; they are already growing and we plan to keep them growing  for many years ahead. Eventually, at a much larger revenue base, original content and revenue growth  will be slower, and we anticipate substantial positive FCF, like our media peers.  Our debt to total cap ratio, at under 10%, is quite conservative compared to most of our media peers at  30-70%, and conservative compared to efficient capital structure theory. Thus we will continue to add  long-term debt as needed to finance our expansion of original content, including in Q2’17.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: ​January 2017​, ​October 2016​, ​July 2016​,  April 2016​, ​January, 2016​, ​October 2015​, ​July 2015​, ​April 2015​.      Summary  We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity in front of us to build a truly global and durable  internet TV business.  We expect to cross the 100 million member mark this weekend. It’s a good start.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding the company’s business opportunity, balancing  contribution profit and investment in the service, localization efforts, operating margins, plans to invest  in growth; product initiatives; marketing spend; impacts on our business from competition; localization  efforts; content strategy, including local content, original and licensed content investments; use of  capital; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue;  contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income,  earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should  anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to  update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.    6      7 Netflix, Inc.
