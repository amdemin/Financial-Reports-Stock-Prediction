We are off to a great start in 2016, expanding the Netflix service to 130 new countries in January and finishing Q1 with over 81 million members on the strength of our fast growing slate of original content. Since 2010, we have offered unlimited streaming for $7.99 per month in the US, and we hope to maintain this affordable entry-price for a long time. As we’ve made vast improvements in our service and content, consumers see even more value and our membership grows. Q1 was no exception and our summary results are below. Q1 Results Net additions in Q1 ‘16 amounted to a record 6.74 million, surpassing our prior high water mark of 5.59 million in Q4 ‘15 and against 4.88 million in the year-ago period. Of our 81.5 million members, 42% are now outside of the US. Operating income was $49 million vs. $97 million in the year ago quarter, as we continue to invest in international markets. Performance in the quarter benefited from the launch of several series, including Making a Murderer (a ​ ​ late December debut), Fuller House (February), House of Cards Season 4 (March) and Daredevil Season 2 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (March), complemented by a diverse mix of new films, documentaries, series and kids shows available globally. In the US, we added 2.23 million members in Q1, against 2.28 million a year ago, and 2.25 two years ago. Our forecast for the quarter was low (at 1.75 million) because we underestimated the positive acquisition impact of our major original content debuts. US revenue rose 18% year-over-year, reflecting 14% growth in average paid memberships and a 3% increase in ARPU. US contribution profit totaled $413 million, or a 35.5% margin, compared to 31.7% a year ago. International revenue increased 57% year-over-year, including the negative impact of currency (-$82 million on a y/y basis). Excluding F/X, international ARPU rose 7% year-over-year. Our Q1 international contribution loss of $104 million came in better than forecast due to the timing of content spend. Our established markets around the world are all growing, and in early Q1 we added 130 more countries. By expanding broadly at once, we are learning more quickly about how best to please consumers across a wide variety of cultures and markets. In most of these markets, so far, Netflix is offered only in English and payment methods are limited primarily to international credit cards. In the coming quarters, we will add more local languages, content, payment options and customer support. We are pleased Netflix is finding acceptance around the world. Consumers worldwide are delighted to be able to enjoy our original and exclusive series and films instantaneously. We have lots of work to do to make Netflix more relevant market by market, but the opportunity is amazing. Q2 Forecast As a reminder, the guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For the second quarter, we expect to add 2.5 million members with 0.5 million in the US and 2.0 million internationally (versus prior year 2.4 million). In the US, our Q2 net adds forecast of 0.5 million is in-line with prior years (0.5, 0.6, 0.6, and 0.9 million from 2012-2015), taking into account a modest impact from the beginning of un-grandfathering. 2Our international forecast for fewer net adds than prior year is due to a tough comparison against the Australia/New Zealand launch. The ANZ growth spike in Q2 last year resulted in international Q2 net adds more than doubling year over year (from 1.12 million to 2.37 million). While ANZ is growing steadily this Q2, it is less than the launch spike last year. Ex-ANZ, international net adds would be forecast up this quarter. International net adds are down sequentially both due to standard seasonality and our launch in 130 countries at very beginning of Q1 (so Q1 captured the initial surge of sign-ups). In the US, we are forecasting flat Y/Y contribution margin in Q2, due to a large slate of content releases and associated marketing. We expect strong y/y margin growth to resume in Q3 and we remain on track to achieve our 40% US contribution margin target by 2020. We expect Q2 international contribution loss to improve sequentially primarily due to recent favorable currency movements. We anticipate that international contribution losses in the second half of 2016 will be similar to the first half, as ongoing investments offset improved profitability in our more mature markets. On China, we are continuing discussions but have no material update on our approach or timing. Whatever we do will have only a modest financial effect in the near term. With respect to un-grandfathering, currently, more than half of our US members pay only $7.99 or $8.99 for our $9.99 HD 2-screen plan. We will phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest-tenured members getting the longest benefit. To reinforce brand trust, we won’t change anyone’s price without their acknowledgement of the new price in their member experience, where they will see a dialogue box about their options. Members can choose our $7.99 SD 1-screen plan, our $9.99 HD 2-screen plan or our $11.99 UHD 4-screen plan. We are rolling this out slowly over the year, rather than mostly in May, so we can learn as we go. Most of our grandfathered members are in the US, but we’ll take the same approach internationally. We expect only modestly increased churn from un-grandfathering, partially because these members have been with us for a reasonable period already, and because our content continues to improve. The increase in ARPU will allow us to invest more in content next year, and we are taking up our expected spend from about $5B in 2016 to over $6B on a P&L basis in 2017 (more on a cash basis). Content In Q1, we had our most ambitious slate of content releases to date. Since the February 19th premiere of Judd Apatow's Love, we have debuted at least one new show or feature film every single week of the ​ ​ quarter. This includes five new seasons of original series as well as several original feature films, documentaries, kids shows and stand-up specials. We launched the second season of Marvel’s Daredevil ​ and the fourth season of House of Cards to strong critical reviews. ​ ​ ​ ​ In addition to stepping up the pace, we’re also broadening our programming to appeal to a large global membership base with diverse tastes. We expanded into the multi-camera sitcom format in Q1 with Fuller House, a family comedy that met with overwhelmingly positive viewer reception. Fuller House, ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 3and the late Q4 release of true crime documentary Making a Murderer, are excellent examples of how ​ ​ Netflix is breaking through the cultural zeitgeist and how our portfolio of original content continues to be a great driver of membership growth for Netflix. We are maintaining a fast pace of content launches in Q2, starting with the recently released sitcom The ​ Ranch, starring Ashton Kutcher. We’ll launch seven new seasons of original series, including ​ Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Grace and Frankie and Orange is the New Black. We will also ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ premiere the original films The Do-Over, Adam Sandler’s second film for Netflix, Special Correspondents ​ ​ ​ featuring Ricky Gervais and Eric Bana, The Fundamentals of Caring, starring Paul Rudd and Brahman ​ ​ ​ Naman from the maverick Indian director Q. ​ Q2 will also mark our initial foray into the talk show genre with Chelsea, starring Chelsea Handler. This ​ ​ talk show will be a bit of a departure from the normal “all episodes at once” model of our other originals. Chelsea will premiere new episodes nightly, three nights per week, shortly after the show is ​ ​ recorded in front of a live audience and will incorporate stylistic elements from her well-received Netflix documentary series Chelsea Does. We are excited to bring Chelsea Handler and this new show to our ​​ ​​ global platform that opens up our original content offering to include more topical programming that merges our already successful comedy and documentary efforts. Our investment in original content for kids and families has helped make Netflix a destination for great creators of live action and animated television. Our original series were nominated for 33 Daytime Emmy nominations across 7 of our original shows, including All Hail King Julien, Project MC2 and ​ ​ ​ ​ Dragons: Race to The Edge. In Q2, we are releasing nine new seasons of original series for kids including ​ Kong: King of The Apes and a re-boot of Voltron. ​ ​ ​ With our footprint now virtually global, Netflix is uniquely positioned to bring stories from all over the world to people all over the world. We’ve stepped up production of non-English language series following up on last year’s success of Club de Cuervos from Mexico and Narcos, which was filmed in ​ ​ ​ ​ Colombia in Spanish and English. Our first French series Marseille, a political drama starring Gerard ​ ​ Depardieu, premieres globally on May 5, while our new Japanese original series Hibana premieres ​ ​​ globally in June. We are also working on 3% in Brazil, Suburra in Italy, Dark in Germany, an ​ ​ ​ ​​ ​ ​ as-yet-untitled period series in Spain, a second season of Club De Cuervos and our second Mexican ​ ​​ original series, Ingobernable, starring Kate Del Castillo in Mexico, as well as our first fully global original ​ ​ ​​ Japanese anime series Perfect Bones. These series help both to cement the popularity and relevance of ​ ​​ Netflix in the territories where they originate and, in success, will reach a broad global audience. We are investing about 5% of our cash content budget in original films. As we learn, we may spend beyond that, once we’ve established that new, fully-exclusive movies debuting on Netflix creates more consumer excitement and member viewing than the territory-by-territory licensing of nine-month-old “Pay One” movies that are also available on TVOD and DVD. Upcoming original films in the second half of 2016 include War Machine, a satirical comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by David Michod, and ​ ​ Mascots, the latest ensemble comedy from Christopher Guest. Our 2017 lineup includes Bong Joon-Ho’s ​ ​​ Okja, and Bright, an epic action film starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer. ​ ​ ​ 4The release schedule for our announced upcoming original content can be found on our PR site. ​ ​ To highlight the expansion of our original content offering, we recently hosted an event in Paris for press and influencers from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Below is a photo of Kevin Spacey and Ted Sarandos, surrounded by our titles, before a large audience. Product At Netflix, we strive to deliver the best video experience for our members and picture quality is an important element of this. In 2014, we began streaming in 4K with the debut of House of Cards Season ​ ​ 2. Today, we have one of the largest catalogues of 4K content available, with the number of 4K titles increasing 10x since inception. Not surprisingly, streaming of 4K content is growing as a share of total viewing. We are also continuing to push the boundaries of visual impact and we're excited about High Dynamic Range (HDR). While 4K offers more pixels, HDR provides greater depth with brighter highlights and a wider color range. Today, you can experience HDR on Netflix with Season One of Marco Polo, if you have ​ ​ an HDR-enabled TV and subscribe to our 4-screen UHD plan. We are expanding our HDR content catalogue rapidly. It wasn't too long ago that online video was associated with grainy images and constant buffering. But today, the Internet, not cable or broadcast distribution, is actually home to the cutting edge of video quality and it will only get better from here as Internet TV replaces linear television. 5We started rolling out new and more efficient encodes during Q1, offering either 20% savings in data, or a commensurate increase in quality, depending on whether a consumer is bandwidth-limited or not. This will be reflected in our ISP speed index reports as a small reduction in average bitrate across all ISPs, but most of the value is realized in improved quality for our customers. We are now turning our attention to mobile-specific encodes, with a desire to deliver better video at lower bandwidth to these devices, which are increasingly important in our newest markets. Partnerships Similar to our content portfolio, our partnerships have expanded in scope over the years, growing in importance with the launch of our service across the world. Originally focused on consumer electronics device integration, Netflix partnerships now span a wide array of relationships with pay TV and mobile operators, Internet service providers, mobile device and set top box manufacturers, and brick and mortar retailers (gift cards). We integrate Netflix to make it easier for members to sign up, access and pay for the service. In addition, our partners benefit through customer acquisition, the opportunity to upsell higher value packages of speed/data/content, lower churn and increases in brand affinity. Recently, Canadian operator Telus said: "Nearly half of Optik TV customers are also Netflix subscribers. Making Netflix available was a simple but powerful innovation to make our customers’ entertainment experience better, and far easier. Not only has this driven deeper engagement with our Optik customers who have Netflix, these same customers are actually consuming more content on Optik, including more on demand content, than ever before.” As Internet TV grows, it is exciting to be a part of a vibrant ecosystem driving innovation and value for consumers all over the world. Competition If you think about your last 30 days, and analyze the evenings you did not watch Netflix, you can understand how broad our competition really is. Whether you played video games, surfed the web, watched a DVD, TVOD, or linear TV, wandered through YouTube, read a book, streamed Hulu or Amazon, or pirated content (hopefully not), you can see the market for relaxation time and disposable income is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea. For example, while we’ve grown from zero to 47 million members in the USA, HBO has also grown, which shows how large the entertainment market is. We earn a tiny fraction of consumers’ time and money, and have lots of opportunity ahead to win more of your evenings away from all those other activities if we can keep improving. 6Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure At the end of Q1, we had cash and equivalents totaling $2.1 billion. In Q1, free cash flow was -$261 million, compared with -$276 million in Q4 ‘15. As we have written in the past, our investment in original programming (particularly owned content) is more cash intensive upfront, resulting in a timing-driven gap between net income and free cash flow. We currently have $2.4 billion of long term debt. With our low debt to enterprise value of 5%, our plan is to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016 or in early 2017. Given the attractiveness of our business model in a growth area relative to other large cap companies, as well as our low debt to EV ratio, investors view our bonds as quite secure; they trade better than the BB index, despite our single B credit rating, (but not yet as well as ​ ​ media firms like Viacom or Discovery). Over time, the ratings agencies may catch up to the buyside in ​ ​ ​ ​ their views of the credit risk for Netflix. DVD Our DVD service ended Q1 with 4.7M members and $72M in contribution profit.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are 7important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.  However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding investments in international markets; localization of our  service; expansion to China and the financial impact of such expansion; end of grandfathered pricing and  its impact on churn and ARPU; price change process; content spending; future content offerings; original  content strategy; product developments such as HDR content and encode efficiency improvements;  future capital raises and timing of such raises; member growth domestically and internationally,  including net, total and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both  domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income,  net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer  usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,  competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and  events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers.  Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on  risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
