The Internnet is transforming video eentertainmennt, stream by stream, conssumer by consumer, nation by nation. Ouur opportunitty is to be onee of the leadeers of this transformation with the bestt streaming vvideo subscriptiion service onn the planet. The last feww months, howwever, have bbeen difficult for shareholdders, employeees, and most uunfortunatelyy, many memmbers of Netflix. While wee dramaticallyy improved our $7.99 unlimited streamming service bby embracing new platformms, simplifyinng our user‐innterface, and more than doubbling domestiic spending on streaming ccontent over 2010, we greeatly upset many domesticc Netflix meembers with our significannt DVD‐related pricing changes, and to a lesser degree, with the proposed‐and‐now‐cancelled rebranding of our DVD service. In doing so, we’ve hurt oour hard‐earned reputation, and stalledd our domestiic growth. But our long‐terrm streamingg opportunityy is as compellling as ever annd we are mooving forward as quickly ass we can to reepair our repuutation and reeturn to growwth.

WWhat we misjuudged was hoow quickly to move there. We compouunded the problem wwith our lack of explanatioon about the rising cost of the expansioon of streaminng content, and steady DVVD costs, so thhat absent thhat explanatioon, many percceived us as ggreedy. Finally, we annouunced and then retracted a seeparate brand for DVD. WWhile this brannding incidennt further dennted our reputation, and causedd a temporaryy cancellationn surge, comppared to our price change,, its impact wwas relatively minor. Our pprimary issuee is many of our long‐term members fellt shocked byy the pricing changes, aand more of tthem have exxpressed thatt by cancellingg Netflix thann we expectedd. Because oof this, our revenue and prrofits in Q4 wwill be lower thhan we had aanticipated, bbut we’ll remaain profitablee on a global bbasis. In Q1’112 we’ll be lauunching in thee UK and Irelaand, as we haad planned. FFor a few quartters starting in Q1, we expect the costs of our entry into the UK aand Ireland wwill push us to be unprofitable on a global basis; that is, domestic profits will noot be large ennough to bothh cover internatioonal investmeents and pay ffor global G&&A and Technoology & Deveelopment. Aftter launchingg the UK and Ireeland, we will pause on oppening new innternational mmarkets until we return too global profitabiliity. We plan to do that byy increasing oour global streeaming subsccriber base faster than we increase oour costs. Investors and memberrs will be relieeved to know we are donee with pricing changes, andd that at $7.999 each for sstreaming andd DVD we cann move forwaard for a long time. Some inveestors have asked us abouut the combinnation or “hybbrid” offeringg in the U.S. In our currentt signup floow, we offer tthree choices: (a) streaminng only at $7.999, (b) DVD oonly at $7.99, and (c) both,, for $15.98. AAbout 7% of nnew memberss choose the $15.98 hybridd offering. OOne could arggue that this percentagge would incrrease if we reduced the price for hybridd, but if we were going to llower prices, we would do it on streamiing. Our futuure is in rapiddly expandingg streaming, bbut we will maake sure thatt current hyybrid subscribbers continuee to get a greaat and stable experience. As of today, less than hallf of our streamming subscribbers also subsscribe to our DVD service, and we expeect that numbber to continuue to fall, given that only 7%% of new streaaming subscriibers also currrently sign upp for DVD. We see a huge global oopportunity for our $7.99 unlimited strreaming service, as indicatted by reachinng 10% of Caanadian houseehold penetration in just oone year sincee launching sservice there. In the U.S., wwe’ll build backk our brand thhe same way we built it in the first placce: no grand gestures, just amazing serrvice day‐after‐‐day, for an inncredibly low price. Q3 Dommestic Resullts We endedd the quarter with 21.4 miillion streaminng subscriptioons and 13.9 million DVD subscriptionss. Unique doomestic subsccribers declinned to 23.8 million subscribbers, driven bboth by a highher than expeected level of caancellations aand a reductioon in acquisitions driven by the PR storm that engulfed our brandd and its impactt on word‐of‐mouth. In spiite of this, wee continued too experience year‐over‐yeear growth in gross 2additions,, acquiring 4.77 million neww subscribers, or nearly 20%% year‐over‐yyear growth. Not only waas acquisition up compared to last yeaar, but SAC off $15 was commparable to QQ2’11 before the brand hitt, and down 24%% from a yearr ago. New suubscribers aree coming for our market‐leeading streamming service. Domestic revenue greww 44% year‐oover‐year to $$799 million in Q3. Despite lower subsccribers than expected,, revenue wass within expeectations as suubscriber canncellations weere back‐loadded in the quaarter relative too our forecastt. Domestic ooperating proffit of $120 million, represeenting 15% operating margin, exceeded our previouss margin targeet of 14% duee to fewer DVVD shipmentss than expected, in part duue to fewer DVD subscriberss as well as lower overall DDVD usage. Q4 Dommestic Outloook In Q4, we are providingg guidance foor both our doomestic DVD and streaminng segments, and will be reporting on that basiss going forward so investors have greatter transparency on the reespective businessees. In the pastt, we have guided to a totaal domestic operating marrgin target. GGoing forwardd, we will be guiding to separate contribuution profit raanges for eachh segment, ass well as provviding guidancce on global nett income and EPS. Similarlyy, we will be ffocused on, aand thereforee guiding to, sstreaming andd DVD subscriptions, as tthey drive revvenue for eacch of our dommestic segmennts (rather thhan total unique domestic subscribers.) Nevertheless, we do anticcipate that tootal unique U.S. subscriberrs will be slighhtly up in Q4. We think DVD subscripptions will deccline sharply this quarter, as reflected iin our guidance, due to ouur price channges. Our weeekly rate of DVD cancellaation is steadiily shrinking, as the price eeffect washess through, aand in future quarters we expect DVD ssubscriptions to shrink moore modestly.. We don’t anticipatee any additionnal material innvestment in equipment oor other PP&EE and a majorrity of our DVVD library is ffully depreciaated; so at $7.99, the segmment is profitaable. We havve yet to decidde whether oor not to offer viideo game disscs. The decission will havee little financiaal impact eithher way. Wee still expect DDVDs to last a loong time, as tthey serve some unique neeeds for completeness, for simplicity, aand for those householdds without acccess to high sspeed broadbband. Our $77.99 pricing iss a full 20% loower than our nearest unlimited DVDD‐by‐mail commpetitor, and our service iss better because we have more distribuution centers annd, as such, faaster deliveryy. Looking at our domesttic streaming segment, we started the ccurrent quartter with somee subscribers who were mosstly DVD users, but paying for both DVDD and streamiing and not uusing streaminng enough to justify payying $7.99 forr it. Those suubscribers aree cancelling sttreaming, which reduces rrevenue and streamingg subscriptionns. This canceellation wave was triggereed by the debit and credit ccard bills arriving with our nnew prices. The wave peakked a few weeks ago and ccancellations are now steaadily decliningg. At the samme time, we ccontinue to seee year‐over‐‐year growth in weekly grooss additions,, demonstrating the continnued strengthh of the streaming value proposition. WWe expect strreaming net aadditions will be negative iin October duue to the canccellation wave referred to above, and aas the wave subsides and ggross additions remain stronng, net additioons will be abbout flat in Noovember, andd strongly possitive in December. Overall forr the quarter we expect slightly negativve streaming net additionss. Streaming 3hours are continuing too climb, as members who use streaminng mostly stayy with Netflixx streaming. OOur streamingg hours year‐tto‐date are up over 3 timees from a yearr ago, and sett new recordss most weekss. The contrribution marggin for domesttic streamingg will be low inn Q4, at around 8% assumming the mid‐ppoint of guidance, due to our increased sttreaming conntent spend. ((Note: contribbution profit is revenue less COGS andd marketing; iit doesn’t incllude our globbal G&A or Tech&Dev). WWe’ve been agggressively increasingg our contentt spending, annd in 2012 will nearly doubble what we’vve spent this year, puttingg us almost at par with whaat HBO, the bbiggest of the premium TV networks, sppends in the UU.S. and makiing the rangee and quality oof content onn Netflix the bbest it has eveer been. As wwe grow the domestic streamingg member basse over cominng quarters, wwe plan to take the streamming contribuution margin uup about 1000 basis pointss every quarteer. New Doomestic Conntent We have ccontinued to rapidly expannd new conteent on the serrvice both doomestically annd internationnally. Specifically, we have reecently closedd output deals with DreammWorks Animmation, Open Road, and Thhe CW, as weell as an ongooing deal withh AMC, all of wwhich will proovide a uniquue differentiator from our competitoors in the yeaars to come. AAs more moviies come fromm “mini‐majoors” like Openn Road, Relativity and Lionsgate relative to the big Hoollywood studdios, Netflix mmembers will enjoy a steaddy stream of ggreat new filmss in addition to the hundreeds of movies recently addded from parttners includinng Paramountt, Sony, Miramax, MGM, Universal, annd Warner Brros. In the nexxt few weekss, the new Johhnny Depp film “The Rumm Diaries” andd the epic actiion film “TheImmortals” wwill open in thheaters and bbe among thee films available tto Netflix subbscribers exclusively in thee pay TV winddow. Other reecent films incclude “Drive” and “The Killer Elite.” Curreent box officee hits like “Paranormal Acttivity 3” and ““Footloose” wwill also be cooming soon for NNetflix subscrribers. Our recennt agreements with AMC aand the CW wwill assure thee flow of excluusive – and adddictive – prioor season seerialized televvision in the cooming years. On top of shhows that havve proven exttremely popuular with Netflix members like “Mad Meen” and “Breaaking Bad,” liccensed from Lionsgate andd Sony Picturres Televisionn respectivelyy, we’ve added “The Walking Dead” from AMC and sseries that apppeal to teenss and young aduults like “Gossip Girl” and “Vampire Diaaries” from Thhe CW. Add this to just rennewed or expandedd deals with AABC, NBC Univversal, FOX, CCBS, Viacom MMedia Netwoorks, Discoverry Communiications, PBS, and Sony Picctures Televission, and we’vve added around 3,800 neew TV episodees to the servicce in recent wweeks. At thiss point, Netflix now offers prior season television content from all 5 U.S. broaddcast networks and 95% oof the U.S. cabble networks.. Netflix SStreaming CContent Quuality – 10xx of Starz There aree various wayss to evaluate the content oof a video‐strreaming serviice. One wayy is to focus purely on quantity, but that leeads to the liccensing of thoousands of raarely watchedd titles. At the other extreeme is concentraating solely onn quality, as mmeasured by the number oof Oscar‐nomminated or Emmmy‐nominatted titles we hhave. Instead, we think abbout the valuee of our conteent as a functtion of how mmuch a given movie or TTV series getss watched rellative to otheer titles, for hoow long and by how manyy members. FFrom 4that persppective, an Osscar‐nominatted film may bbe of less valuue to Netflix ssubscribers than “Pawn Sttars,” because ssubs are watcching the reality show morre than the Osscar‐nominatted movie. We have tthe Starz offeering within oour service, annd it is currenntly running aabout 6% of vviewing hourss because wwe have addeed so many otther movies aand TV showss (with no bias one way or the other in our merchanddising). In othher words, 944% of the timee members sttream from NNetflix, they aare watching aa non‐Starzz title. Includiing the Sony ffilms from Staarz, which Staarz removed ffrom Netflix sseveral months ago, the 66% figure wouuld rise to aboout 10%. From this perspeective, Netflixx has about teen times the streamingg content seleection of full SStarz, in terms of what connsumers actually choose too watch. Using a similar techniqque, we have analyzed all tthe video conntent offered through Amaazon Prime, including the TV prograams announcced but not yeet live. We have essentiallly all of this ccontent on Neetflix, and that ccontent contrributes a small fraction of Netflix viewinng. Specificallly, the dupliccative Amazon content thhat is available on Netflix rrepresents more than halff of hours viewwed for only 2% of our subscribers. Thereforee, when evaluuating Amazoon Prime as a competitive sstand‐alone ooffering, this low content seelection explaains why we hhave not seenn much usagee of Amazon Prime in our research. Hulu Plus is harder to aanalyze becauuse we think most Hulu Plus subs are ppaying to get ccurrent seasoon TV content, wwhich Netflix does not carry, such as this week’s SNLL clips, on theeir TV‐conneccted devices, rather thaan paying for the Plus‐speccific content. In this sensee, Hulu Plus ccurrent seasoon TV is just a complementary contennt model to uus, like sports or news subsscriptions. OOur prior seasson TV offerinng is far more ccomplete thaan Hulu Plus, aand our moviie content is vvastly larger tthan Hulu Pluus, but, again,, we think mosst people whoo pay for Huluu Plus are doiing so for lastt‐night’s TV episodes on thheir PS3, iPads, and otherr devices. Netflix is the Conteent Leader – but Videoo is not Muusic Radio stattions and teleevision netwoorks developeed with different content licensing moddels, and the online evoolution of muusic and videoo streaming seervices to a laarge extent reeflects that leegacy. With radioo, automatic,, non‐negotiaable, statutoryy music licenssing meant thhat there wouuld be no exclusivityy over the muusic played byy different raddio stations. Clear Channeel, for exampple, doesn’t geet Sony Mussic exclusivelyy. As music mmoved online from radio, the music labeels and majorr music servicces – Pandora, Rhapsody, Sppotify, iTunes, Amazon, annd others – coontinued this non‐exclusive practice, offering a nearly compplete selectionn of songs. In television, by contraast, the netwoorks (ABC, FX, etc.) have loong relied upoon exclusive ccontent to differentiaate among thhemselves. As video movees online, so ttoo has this practice of excclusive contennt. HBO has aan exclusive license to receent Universall movies that includes its oonline HBO GO, for exampple. Netflix has signed excluusive licensess for DreamWWorks Animation, for Relattivity, and othhers. In episoodic television, exclusives aare also the noorm. Netflix doesn’t license “Deadwoood” from HBOO because theey see strategic vvalue in keeping it exclusivve. Netflix liccenses “Mad MMen” and “House of Cards” exclusivelyy for much the same reasonn. 5We have ddramatically more content than any other subscripttion service or network, buut given the existing licensing struccture of the caable networkindustry, thee total contennt available wwill likely remaain carved upp between Neetflix, Showtimme, HBO, Hulu and others.. Two services can licensee jointly, or frrom one anothher, like Netfllix and Epix, wwhere it is in ttheir mutual interest, butto date that has been the exceptionn rather than the rule. While we and our commpetitors face the constrainnts imposed bby the traditional licensingg structure off cable, we have many aadvantages ovver linear preemium pay neetworks. We are unbundleed, and chargge a very low pprice of $7.999 a month. We are pure onn‐demand so we can creatte more comppelling user experiencces than a primarily linear channel. Wee are personaalized, so each user interfaace is tailoredd specificallly to the indivvidual taste of a given conssumer, helpinng them to eaasily find movvies and TV shhows they’ll enjjoy. Finally, wwe can innovaate at Interneet pace ratherr than cable‐sset‐top‐firmwware‐update ppace. We don’t have to “beaat” Starz or otther networkss to succeed. In fact, we ooffer significant value to thhe television licensing ecoosystem by crreating additional revenuee in the prior season windoow for netwoorks, which alloows them to iinvest in additional first ruun content. WWe won’t havve every movie or TV seriess; but we do proovide enough value that coonsumers alsoo want to subbscribe to Netflix. Any givven consumer will have onlyy one of DirecTV or Comcast, say, for their video servvice. That is cclassic either‐‐or competition. But with ppremium teleevision netwoorks like Netflix, the more ggood experiences there arre, the more consumerrs are willing to spend to hhave multiple channels froom which to gget enjoyment. Internattional We’re pleeased to report that we have over 1 million Canadiann members, aand we madee a small contributiion profit in QQ3 in Canada.. We’re excited enough byy the opportuunity in Canadda that, over the next year,, we are doubbling our quarterly content spending, sttarting by addding in Q4 hitt feature films in their first pay window,, such as “Truue Grit”, “Blacck Swan” and “The Chroniccles of Narniaa: Voyage of tthe Dawn Treader”, along with considerable high proofile feature ffilms just comming out of thheir first pay window, aand premiumm catalog film titles, as well as many TV series. By thhe time we’vee added all thhis great enteertainment, wwe will have ccomparable content qualitty to what wee have in the U.S., and be spending the populatioon‐adjusted eequivalent. Thhis investmennt will push coontribution mmargin back under in Canadaa for a few quarters, and our plan is to aachieve consiistent positivee contribution profit startiing in Q3 of nexxt year, two yeears after ourr initial launch. In early Seeptember, wee launched Netflix in 43 coountries in Lattin America. Early resultss indicate that member ccount at the eend of the year will be a litttle above Canada at the eend of 2010, wwhere we hadd far higher braand awarenesss from the sttart. Given tthat Latin America has aboout 4x more bbroadband householdds than Canadda, there is loots of room foor growth. WWe recently addded supportt for Androidin the regionn, with suppoort for Xbox and iOS to follow in comingg weeks, and are constantly adding neww content. Now that we are serving hhundreds of thousands of Latin Americaans, we can mmeasure what is getting ennjoyed a lot, aand what isn’t, and adjust our mix of coontent accorddingly. We are just beginnning in this maarket with a loot to learn, annd a lot we caan improve ovver time, so itt’s too early tto tell whetheer we will reach run‐rate break‐even within two yearsas we would like. 6We annouunced this moorning that wwe are launchiing in the UK and Ireland in Q1. The UKK is a large media market with about 26 million houseeholds. Abouut 20 million hhouseholds hhave broadband Internet aand video gamme console peenetration is vvery high. About 60% of hhouseholds subscribe to aan MVPD offeering from eitheer Sky or Virggin, comparedd to the roughhly 90% of U.S. and Canadian househollds that subsccribe to an MVPPD. The UK mmarket is simiilar to Canadaa in that onlinne piracy use is reasonablyy small and neearly everyone has a debit oor credit card,, unlike Latin America. In ggeneral, UK ISSP’s do not haave Canadian‐style low broaddband usage ccaps. Over‐thhe‐top video is more deveeloped in the UK, with greaater familiaritty and usagee for catch‐upp‐TV than in CCanada or thee U.S., with suuch offerings as the BBC iPPlayer and 4oD. In terms oof premium TTV networks, SSky Movies has exclusives for first pay wwindow featuure films withh all six major American stuudios, and offfers service sttarting at £166 per month oover Virgin annd Sky, attractting about 4.5 million subsccribers. In adddition, consuumers pay thee mandatory BBC license ffee of about ££12 per month. Finally, Lovvefilm has a liittle over 1 million subscribbers in the UK paying about £10 per month for DVD‐bby‐mail, as weell as a small bbut growing sstreaming librrary with thatt offering. Wee believe our service, att an aggressivve price, will bbe compellingg. As in the UU.S., it is not aa winner takees all market; UK members will subscribe to Netflix and to other eentertainment offerings. WWe have to atttract and rettain subscribers efficiently enough to bee able to geneerate a profit. While we normally targeet two years tto profitabiliity, with the increased commpetition in the UK relativve to Canada, we anticipate it may take longer. WWe’ll know more after ourr first few quaarters. TV Everyywhere Dueling Modeels in the U.S. We’ve wrritten before tthat authentication models for Internett access of caable network content would be our eventtual primary ccompetitor. The first of thhe two models for authenttication is thaat subscriberss use their MVPPD applicationn, such as DisshOnline, or CComcast Xfinitty, to access content onlinne from laptoops, tablets, phones, game consoles, Smmart TVs, and Internet set‐ttops. The seccond of the twwo models foor authentication is subsccribers use thhe cable TV neetwork appliccations, such as HBO GO or WatchESPNN on the iPad oor Roku or Sammsung TV. WWhichever moodel wins viewwing share ovver time will cconfer a lot off profit powwer on its owner, and the competition iis stimulatingg a lot of investment by booth MVPDs annd networks in TV Everywwhere. In the long term, Smmart TVs and tablets will bbe similar, offfering a wide range of vvideo applicattions via the IInternet, incluuding Netflix.. It’s slightly better for us if those other applicatioons are also “cchannels” likee ESPN and HBO, because they are on eequal footingg with us. It’s slightly worse for us if the other primary applicattions are EPGGs like DishOnnline, and Xfinnity, because we wouldn’t be in those EPGs. We remmain focused oon making ouur service onee of the best, in terms of consumerr value and eaase of use, ass the market ddevelops. Faceboook / VPPA UUpdate We were thrilled to announce at Faacebook’s f8 cconference inn September oour new Faceebook integraation that allowws Netflix subscribers in Caanada and Lattin America too connect theeir Netflix subbscriptions with their Faceebook accounnts. The Netfllix/Facebook integration eempowers Neetflix subscribers to share wwhat they watcch on Netflix wwith their frieends on Facebbook and commmunicate abbout that conntent. We’ve seen strong connect rates inn Latin American and Canaada, but we are in the early phase of integration in tthese 7countries and we havee yet to see juust how poweerful an impacct this will havve on the connsumer experiencce and our inddustry. We have ddecided not tto launch Facebook integraation in the UU.S., due to thhe Video Privaacy Protectioon Act (VPPA), a 1980’s law thhat creates soome confusion over our abbility to let U..S. members cchoose to automaticcally share their viewing history with friends on Faceebook. A bipaartisan group of lawmakerrs has introduceed legislation, H.R. 2471, a bill to moderrnize the VPPPA to allow suubscribers to mmake this chooice. We are pleased that thhis bipartisan group of lawwmakers recoggnizes the neeed to modernnize this law tthat has not keept pace withh technology, and that connsumers, the eeconomy andd innovative ttechnologies will benefit if it passes. Just for Kids Kids and ffamily contennt is a very important part of the Netflixx streaming ooffering, drivinng significant hours viewwed. We know that kids teend to have ddifferent viewwing behaviorr from adults; namely, kidss love to watch tthe same thinng over and oover again. More importanntly, kids idenntify with showws more by the characters than by thee title. With thhis in mind, wwe launched aa new “Just foor Kids” feature in July whiich provides aa more intuitive and enjoyyable way for children to wwatch all of thhe great age‐aappropriate TTV shows andd movies available to watcch instantly frrom Netflix. By clickingg on the “Justt For Kids” tab on the Netfflix website, kkids can find aa world of moovies and TV shows suiitable for children 12 and uunder, with kkid‐friendly geenres and sorrting by charaacters such ass “Dora thee Explorer”, “PPhineas & Ferrb”, “iCarly”, “Caillou” andd “Thomas the Tank Enginee." This new feature is just one morre way we aree improving oour UI and consumer expeerience to bettter connect subscribers with moviees and TV shoows they’ll lovve. “Just for KKids” is available on the PCC and Mac to Netflix meembers with similar functionality to comme on the Wiii, iPad and mmany other deevices in coming months. 8Free Cassh Flow Our streaming contentt offering andd the associated expense hhas risen drammatically overr the past feww quarters. We’ve addedd $1.34 billionn of streamingg content asssets to our baalance sheet ssince the start of 2011. In ggeneral, we hhave been succcessful in maatching paymment terms with the expense so cash use for streamingg content has been a bit ahhead of expennse but offsett by other sources of cash such as stock comp. Ass a result, freee cash flow haas roughly folllowed net income. In Q3, FCFF of $13.8 milllion increased sharply yeaar‐over‐year ((77%), but siggnificantly trailed net incomme of $62 millioon. Our Septeember Latin AAmerica launcch, with a full quarter of caash paymentss but only one month of amortizationn, was a material contributtor to this gapp. In additionn, we had approximately $$22 million in content paymments go out at the end off the quarter for content sstarting on the site in earlyy October, increasing thee prepaid conntent on our bbalance sheet. We expecct our FCF to ccontinue to laag net incomee for the nextt few quarterrs as our spennding on content continuess to increase bboth domestiically and inteernationally. As a reminder, when a content licennse meets thee criteria for library asset recognition, wwe recognize the value of the license feees as an assett in our conteent library whhile unpaid poortions are reccognized as liabilities. Since many oof our agreemments are muulti‐year, the aadditions willl be amortized and the liabilities paid, in mostt cases, over sseveral years.. In sum, A/P and other noon‐current liabilities (long‐term A/P) will increase as tittles from neww deals becomme available oon our servicee. We used $$39.6 millionin Q3 to repuurchase 182,0000 shares att an average ccost basis of $$218. Since inception of our share repurchasingg programs inn 2007, the avverage cost peer share repuurchased is $445. After the repurchases, we finished tthe quarter wwith $366 million in cash and equivalennts. Historically, we have always run a vvery lean capital structure,, returning alll “excess” cassh to sharehoolders in the formm of buybackks. We expectt to report a gglobal consoliidated net losss in Q1’12 ass well as to 9consume cash as we laaunch the UK.. By pausing on further intternational expansion andd halting buybbacks, our current cash on haand is adequate to supportt the growth oof the busineess.
