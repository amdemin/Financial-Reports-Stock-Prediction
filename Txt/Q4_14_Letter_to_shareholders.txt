In 2014, we added a record 13.0 million new members, compared to 11.1 million in 2013, bringing our global total to 57.4 million members. In Q4, we added 4.33 million members vs 4.07 million in the previous year period. We expect to end Q1 2015 with 61.4 million global members. Internet TV is growing globally and Netflix is leading the charge. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Our US forecast for Q4 members proved very accurate (39.11A versus 39.07F). Internationally, our forecast was low, and actuals came in slightly ahead (18.28A versus 17.99F). To remind everyone, the quarterly forecast we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. On an absolute basis (as opposed to relative to forecast), US net adds are down compared to one year ago (1.9 million this Q4 versus 2.3 million for Q4 2013). In October, we judged the leading factor of the similar decline in Q3 y/y net adds to be our May price change. Since then, with additional research, we now think that the decline in y/y net adds would have largely taken place independent of the price change. We’ve found our growth in net adds is strongest in the lower income areas of the US, which would not be the case if there was material price sensitivity. Additionally, we implemented a similar price change in Mexico during Q4, and saw no detectable change in net additions. We think, instead, the reduction in y/y net additions is a natural progression in our large US market as we grow. We have built in flexibility to our business model in terms of how quickly we grow content and marketing spend, so we intend to keep US contribution margins growing even with lower membership growth. This year we plan to increase US contribution margins from 30% in Q1 to about 32% in Q1 2016 to about 34% in Q1 2017, etc. We’ll re-evaluate the margin progression model again in early 2020 when we hopefully achieve 40% contribution margins. It is increasingly clear that virtually all entertainment video will be Internet video in the future. We believe there is big growth ahead in the US market for Netflix, even if we may not get there in a straight line of 6 million annual net adds. We’ll continue to improve our content, our marketing and our service, to eventually achieve “must have” status in most households. Our international segment is growing very nicely with net adds of 2.43 million members in Q4, compared to 1.74 million a year ago. Our initial set of markets (Canada, Latin America, the UK, Ireland, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands) achieved contribution profitability in Q3 and continue to grow. Our launch in Q3 in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg went well and our new original content is particularly popular. With all of the additional new original content set to premiere in 2015, it will be a big year for us in France, Germany and our other recently launched markets. We’ve successfully built big demand for Netflix from Argentina to Finland, due in part to the overall shift from linear to Internet TV. In late Q1, we’ll be launching Netflix in Australia and New Zealand. There are numerous local competitors and a thirst for movies and TV shows from around the world. Later in the year, we’ll launch additional major countries, in keeping with our global strategy. 2Our international expansion strategy over the last few years has been to expand as fast as we can while staying profitable on a global basis. Progress has been so strong that we now believe we can complete our global expansion over the next two years, while staying profitable, which is earlier than we expected. We then intend to generate material global profits from 2017 onwards. We already offer Netflix in about 50 countries and have learned a great deal about the content people prefer, the marketing they respond to and how to best organize ourselves for steady improvement. Acceleration to 200 countries is largely made possible by the tremendous growth of the Internet in general, including on phones, tablets and smart TVs. We intend to stick to our core ad-free subscription model. As with our initial round of international expansion, we’ll get some things wrong and do our best to fix them quickly. For most countries we have a good idea of the best approach for Netflix to take. For China, we are still exploring options — all of them modest. We’ll learn a great deal if we can successfully operate a small service in China centered on our original and other globally-licensed content. That is our preference, for the next few years, if we are able to acquire the necessary permissions. It is advantageous for Netflix to become global in many ways. The big one is absolute size (faster to $10B in revenue) because that revenue allows us to develop and license more content for our members and improve our service. A second is being able to source great stories from around the world and deliver them to the world. A third is the efficiency and influence of being a unique global licensor that provides worldwide distribution. With the growth of the Internet over the next 20 years, there will be some amazing entertainment services available globally. We intend to be one of the leaders. Content Looking at our original content performance over the last few years, there have been so many impressive aspects: how this effort, begun in 2012, has improved perceptions of the Netflix brand; how we’ve had a good start with 45 Emmy, 10 Golden Globe and two Academy Award nominations and several wins in just two years; how success with one great creator leads to new opportunities for other projects; how producing around the world with incredibly diverse talent is working for us; how much we feel we are just scratching the surface. But there is one real shocker; last year our original content overall was some of our most efficient content. Our originals cost us less money, relative to our viewing metrics, than most of our licensed content, much of which is well known and created by the top studios. We will continue to grow the percentage of our content spending dedicated to originals for the next several years. This will mean more cash usage, which means more debt. We factor interest cost into our originals budget as we try to make each project more efficient and effective than studio content we’d otherwise be licensing. 3Marco Polo has struck a chord across all Netflix territories, generating substantial viewing over the holiday season. It has a 93% Audience rating from Rotten Tomatoes compared to 96% for House of Cards and 96% for Game of Thrones for their first seasons. They are all incredibly entertaining shows. We intend to debut a second season of Marco Polo in 2016. We are thrilled to offer exclusively the controversial comedy, The Interview, to our US and Canadian members beginning this Saturday, Jan. 24 - just thirty days after it debuted in theaters and pay-per-view. Our first original feature film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II: The Green Destiny, is now in post production and will debut on August 26 in all of our markets. We expect to open the film on select IMAX screens the same day as its release on Netflix. This year, we are launching 320 hours of original series (new and returning), films, documentaries and stand-up comedy specials, triple the amount of original programming Netflix released in 2014. In Q1, we are premiering Season Three of House of Cards, the new Tina Fey and Robert Carlock comedy The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt starring Ellie Kemper and Bloodline, an intense family thriller from the creators of Damages that stars Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, Norbert Leo Butz, Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard. Our original documentary Virunga just secured our second back-to-back Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature and What Happened, Miss Simone?, a look at the life of the legendary singer Nina Simone, will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this week and at the Berlin Film Festival in February. Beginning this quarter, and in current Netflix territories outside the US and Canada, Netflix will be the exclusive home of Better Call Saul, Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad prequel that focuses on attorney Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk). In many territories outside of the UK, we just premiered the second season of the critically acclaimed British drama, The Fall with Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. For an overall view of our original content slate and upcoming premiere dates, please click here Product We have continued to deliver a variety of algorithmic and data improvements that put better choices in front of members. We are also pioneering offering new high-quality video formats, delivering UHD-4K for House of Cards and Marco Polo. Soon we will be offering High Dynamic Range video (HDR) which captures and renders pictures with more realistic peak brightness in the highlights, and may be a more significant step forward in viewing pleasure than UHD-4K. We will start building our library to deliver in HDR as new TVs become available from several manufacturers this year. Having supported the vast majority of Smart TV devices with a Netflix app, we are now turning our attention to more operator devices and set-top boxes. Following our success with Virgin Media in the UK, we have added British Telecom and TalkTalk on the YouView STB in the UK, Deutsche Telecom STBs in Germany, Bouygues, SFR, and Orange STBs in France, Proximus in Belgium, and DISH STBs in the US. The BT and Orange partnerships include a new payment capability, similar to what we offer on AppleTV. 4Members can elect for BT/Orange to bill on our behalf and the appeal of a single bill seems to be attractive. Marketing Each quarter a greater percentage of our marketing dollars is spent promoting our exclusive content as we believe it is the best way to drive consumer demand for Netflix. Our biggest campaign in Q4 was for Marco Polo, which we launched globally in early December. Separately, our highly targeted campaign behind the Netflix original documentary Virunga is continuing into Q1 with its Oscar nomination. In Q4, we also executed more modest campaigns behind King Julien to spur family viewing over the holidays and shared a moment of Netflix love with our Airport commercial timed to Thanksgiving travel in the US. Looking forward, we are launching campaigns for The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Better Call Saul (internationally) and Season 3 of House of Cards. We were pleased last week on the release of the YouGov Brand Index showing US brands with the most positive buzz, with Netflix at #3, up from #12 in 2013 and another indicator of how our brand is continuing to build momentum. Strong Net Neutrality People around the world increasingly view Internet access as a necessary utility -- Finland even made fast Internet access a legal right. Recently President Obama echoed the same themes in his call for the FCC to take bold steps to be able to ensure a low-cost high-speed Internet. The support for strong net neutrality continues to grow. Competition There is no news yet on timing or price of HBO’s expansion of a direct-to-consumer model to the US. Their Nordics’ offer is priced about the same as Netflix but the content offering includes only HBO and other original series, and not the breadth of movie content HBO offers in the US. Verizon and Redbox shut down their Netflix streaming competitor after about one year of operation. CBS launched its CBS All Access streaming service which, like Hulu, has commercial interruptions. Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Yahoo are all increasing their original programming efforts. Shomi and CraveTV launched in Canada. In many of our international markets, we face competition from both stand alone OTT services (Clarovideo in Mexico, for instance) and ones associated with incumbent broadcasters (CanalPlay in France). In Australia we will face strong competition this year, and look forward to getting started later this quarter. Piracy continues to be one of our biggest competitors. This graph of Popcorn Time’s sharp rise relative to Netflix and HBO in the Netherlands, for example, is sobering. 5MVPDs around the world are moving as they can to on-demand cloud-DVR models. Dish and Sony are launching “Internet MVPD” services. In general, Internet TV is going mainstream, which both increases the size of the market and brings new competitors. It couldn’t be a more exciting time in our industry! DVD Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight 5.8 million members, adding $89 million in contribution profit in Q4. The comprehensive selection of titles available on DVD and Blu-ray includes new release films, major TV shows (including HBO and Showtime series) and much more. Global Expenses, Income & Tax Rate On a pro-forma basis (without the tax reserve release described below) net income would have been $45 million, compared to a forecast of $27 million, due to lower than expected international losses and tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the 2014 R&D tax credit (independent of the tax reserve release). Our global technology and general and administrative costs increased year on year in support of continued international and content expansion. Our Q1 guidance reflects a sequential increase in these costs primarily related to adjustments in annual market compensation. In Q4, we resolved certain prior year tax audits, primarily related to R&D tax credits, resulting in the release of $39 million in reserves from the prior open tax periods. We also expect a favorable effect on our future effective tax rate of around 2% due to a lowered reserve rate on the R&D credit going forward. Because of our international expansion plans for 2015, we expect full year operating income for 2015 to be lower than full year 2014. Free Cash Flow & Capital We finished the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents. Given we are investing faster in content (this Q1 will show a step up in cash use with all the original projects launching in the quarter) and the current favorable interest rate environment, we intend to raise at least a billion dollars, pending market conditions, of additional long-term debt in a similar manner to last year. Over the next few years we expect to continue financing our original content expansion with long-term debt. As long as the maturities are spread out, and the interest cost is built into our content budgets, we think long-term debt is the best way for Netflix to finance the production of content. 67  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2014, July 2014,   April 2014,  January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013.

Management  believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax  reserves provides useful information as these measures exclude benefits that are not indicative of our  core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric  because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in- home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could                      9  cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in  our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.  The Company provides internal  forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast  numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                              10 Netflix, Inc.
