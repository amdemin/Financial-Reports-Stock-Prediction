We are growing nicely across the world and are on track to exceed $11 billion in revenue in 2017. Internet entertainment is delighting consumers, and we are staying at the forefront of this once-in-a-generation opportunity. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Global streaming revenue in Q3 rose 33% year over year, driven by a 24% increase in average paid memberships and 7% growth in ASP. Operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $209 million with our Q3 global operating margin of 7.0% putting us right on track to achieve our full year target of 7%. EPS of $0.29 included a pre-tax $51 million non-cash loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro bond (or $39 million after tax based on a 24% tax rate). Higher than expected excess tax benefit from stock based compensation benefited our tax rate by $5 million vs. our forecast. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We added a Q3-record 5.3 million memberships globally (up 49% year-over-year) as we continued to benefit from strong appetite for our original series and films, as well as the adoption of internet entertainment across the world. Relative to our guidance of 4.4 million net adds, we under-forecasted both US and international acquisition. Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29% versus last year. Domestic contribution margin in Q3 of 35.8% vs. 36.4% last year was below our forecast of 37.1% due primarily to the earlier-than-anticipated close of certain content deals. The foreign currency impact in the quarter was +$13 million and Q3 international revenue grew 54% year over year, excluding currency. F/X-neutral ASP increased 7.4% year over year. International contribution profit margin of 4.7% exceeded our 2.3% guidance, also due to the timing of content deals. For Q4, we forecast global net adds of 6.30m (1.25m in the US and 5.05m internationally) vs. 7.05m in the year ago quarter (which was our all-time high for quarterly net adds). We recently announced price adjustments in many markets to our HD and 4K video plans while keeping our SD plan mostly unchanged (still $7.99 in the US, for instance). Existing members will be notified and their prices will be adjusted on a rolling basis over the next few months. Increased revenue over time will help us grow our content offering and continue our global operating margin growth. We’ve been focused on growing global operating margin as our primary profitability metric since hitting our 2020 US contribution margin goal of 40% this past Q1. This allows us to avoid near term optimization for specific domestic or international contribution margin targets which could impede our long term growth. For instance, we anticipate our Q4’17 US contribution margin will be 34.4% (a decline both year-on-year and sequentially) as we boost our marketing investment against a growing content slate. We spend disproportionately in the US to generate media and influencer awareness for our programming which we believe, in turn, is an effective way to facilitate word of mouth globally. In our international segment, we are on track to generate positive contribution profit for the full year. As we move into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing operating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the rest of the world. 2Content Five years ago, we embarked on our original programming strategy and we’re very pleased with our progress in transforming Netflix from a service with not just second run content but also must-see new releases, like Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Fuller House, Making a ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Murderer, Narcos, The Crown and 13 Reasons Why, among many others. ​ ​ ​ This quarter, we launched several new series such as the gritty drama Ozark and comedy Friends from ​ ​ ​ College by Nick Stoller as well as Marvel’s The Defenders and returning seasons of fan favorites like ​ ​ ​ Narcos and Fuller House. We’re also making good strides on original films (as measured by member ​ ​ ​ viewing relative to our investment) with the debut of Death Note (based on the popular Japanese IP), ​ ​ Naked (a romantic comedy featuring Marlon Wayans) and To the Bone (an intense drama starring Lily ​ ​ ​ Collins). Investors often ask us about continued access to content from diversified media companies. While we have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear. Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes. Our investment in Netflix originals is over a quarter of our total P&L content budget in 2017 and will continue to grow. With $17 billion in content commitments over the next several years and a growing library of owned content ($2.5 billion net book value at the end of the quarter), we remain quite comfortable with our ability to please our members around the world. We’ll spend $7-8 billion on content (on a P&L basis) in 2018. Just as we moved from second-run content to licensed originals and then to Netflix-produced originals, we are progressing even further up the value chain to work directly with talented content creators. In August, we announced an overall deal with Shonda Rhimes, the creator of global smash hits like Grey’s ​ ​ ​ Anatomy, How to Get Away with Murder, Scandal, and others. We also acquired Millarworld, our one ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ M&A transaction in our 20 year history, the home of legendary comic book writer Mark Millar. Our goal is to work with the best creators in the world and own the underlying intellectual property so that we can continue to deliver amazing content to our members across the globe. In working with the best talent, we strive hard for awards recognition. At this year’s Primetime Emmys, we scored 20 wins out of 92 nominations, second only to HBO, spread across eight different titles. Competition Since 2013, we’ve taken the Long Term View that we’re in the early stages of the worldwide, ​ ​ multi-decade transition from linear TV to internet entertainment. Recently, it’s been unfolding right before our eyes: Disney announced plans to launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and its other ​ ​ brands, cable network owners are licensing their channels to virtual MVPDs like Hulu, YouTube, Sling TV, and DirecTV Now, CBS’ All Access is expanding internationally, Apple is reportedly planning on spending ​ ​ $1 billion on original content and Amazon is streaming NFL games while its Prime Video service has gone global. Facebook launched its Watch tab for original videos. ​ ​ 3At the same time, linear TV networks like MTV, A&E and WGN are cutting down on scripted series. Last ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ year, the number of original scripted series on linear TV (across broadcast, premium and basic cable) began to decrease as online services ramped up activity. It’s an exciting period and both media and technology companies see the same big opportunity as we do. We have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible to please our members by earning their viewing time and to stay ahead of the competition in the decades to come. Product and Partnerships Ironically, as linear networks move outside of the traditional bundle and into direct-to-consumer applications, we are working more closely than ever with MVPDs/ISPs and other distributors. Building on our Q2 partnership with SFR/Altice in France, where Netflix is sold in a package with high speed Internet and TV services, and an earlier, comparable partnership with Proximus of Belgium, this past quarter we announced the bundling of Netflix into T-Mobile’s ONE family plan. Our partners are enthusiastic about ​ ​ the response to these bundles as the excitement around our big content enhances their offerings. Our goal with all of our partnerships is to make it easy for members to sign up, pay and enjoy Netflix. We are pleased with the early results and we will continue pursuing these bundling opportunities as a complement to our core direct-to-consumer approach. Free Cashflow and Capital Structure Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$465 million vs. -$506 million last year and -$608 million in Q2’17. There is no change to our expectation for FCF of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. Negative FCF, despite growing operating income, is due to growth of our content spend, original content in particular, where we pay for the titles before consumers enjoy the content, and the asset is amortized by estimated viewing over time. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market as our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity. Summary This quarter, among other new offerings, we are releasing the second Netflix original series from David Fincher (Mindhunter), new seasons of our globally acclaimed franchises Stranger Things and The Crown, ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ our first Italian and German original shows (Suburra and Dark) and our most ambitious film yet, Bright, ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer. We feel privileged to be working with great artists all over the world and to be able to bring their creations to a big, and growing, global audience. We’re delighted that consumers are embracing internet entertainment and are finding value and pleasure in the incredible stories offered by Netflix.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
