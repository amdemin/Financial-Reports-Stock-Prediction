2. 'module_text_blocks.py' is file that processes the text files into blocks of text, convenient for analysis
3. 'sentiment models' are files that perform sentiment analysis individually
4. 'timeseries correlation.ipynb' is file that performs correlation analysis between stock data and sentiment scores
