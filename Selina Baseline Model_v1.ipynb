       "  \"Revenue grew 24% year over year and was in line withour beginning of quarter forecast, while operating profit and margin reached all-time highs. We finishedQ1’21 with 208m paid memberships, up 14% year over year, but below our guidance forecast of 210mpaid memberships. We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forwardin 2020 and a lighter content slate in the firsthalf of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays. We continueto anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hitsand an exciting film lineup. In the short-term, thereis some uncertainty from Covid-19; in the long-term,the rise of streaming to replace linear TV aroundthe world is the clear trend in entertainment. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Average revenue per membership1rose 6% year overyear, or 5%, excluding a foreign exchange impact of +$80m. Operating income of $2 billion vs. $958 millionmore than doubled vs. Q1’20. This exceeded our guidance forecast primarily due to the timing of contentspend. EPS of $3.75 vs. $1.57 a year ago included a $253m non-cash unrealized gain from F/Xremeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The extraordinary events of Covid-19 led to unprecedentedmembership growth in 2020, as it pulled forward growth from 2021, and delayed production acrossevery region. In turn, we ended 2020 with a bigger membership and revenue base than we would otherwisehave had, contributing to record Q1’21 revenues. And since we were still ramping productionlevels late last year, we had lower content spendin 1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesales taxes or VAT. Q1’21 - content amortization only grew 9.5% year over year in Q1’21 vs. 17% in FY20. The result was a 10 percentage point year over year jump in our operatingmargin to 27% in Q1, which is an all-time high. As we discussed in past letters, these dynamics arealso contributing to a lighter content slate in thefirst half of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth. In Q1, paid net additions of 4m were below our 6m guidance (and the 16m net additions inthe year ago quarter) primarily due to acquisition, as retention in Q1 was in line with our expectations.We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor inthe variance as the over-forecast was across allof our regions. We also saw similar percentage year-over-yeardeclines in paid net adds in all regions (see our Regional Breakdown table below), whereas the levelof competitive intensity varies by country. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be highrelative to our guidance forecast and, in others,it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. Asour membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paidnet additions performance vs. forecast. With similar pull forward and delayed slate dynamicsplus our typical seasonality expected to impact Q2’21, we project paid net additions of 1m (vs. 10min the prior year quarter) with our UCAN and LATAM regions expected to be roughly flattish in memberships(+/- a couple hundred thousand paid net adds). We anticipate paid membership growth will re-acceleratein the second half of 2021 as we ramp into a very strong back half slate with the return of bighits likeSex Education,The Witcher,La Casa dePapel (akaMoney Heist), andYou, as well as an excitingarray of original films including the finale toTheKissing Boothtrilogy and large scale, star-driven featureslikeRed Notice(starring Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds) andDon’t Look Up(with an all-starcast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and MerylStreep). We’ll also have our most comprehensive offering to date of local language titlesincludingToo Hot to Handlefor Brazil and Mexico, 2a special based on our Korean hit franchiseKingdom, the action-thrillerDhamaka(India), as well as new seasons ofSintonia(Brazil), andControl Z(Mexico). As always, we’re focusing on the fundamentals of ourbusiness, which remain healthy. In addition to our record financial results, engagement per member householdgrew solidly year over year in Q1’21. We’re also seeing how much members value Netflix with Q1’21churn below Q1‘20 levels, demonstrating that as we improve the service, we can charge a bit more.Our FY21 operating margin target of 20% vs. 18% last year remains unchanged. We are optimistic aboutthe future and believe we are still in the earlydays of the adoption of internet entertainment, which shouldprovide us with many years of growth ahead. Content As seen in the weekly growth chart above, in earlyQ1, with the benefit ofBridgerton,LupinandCobra Kai, we were following a growth trajectory similarto recent years. As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will leadto a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises.And while the roll out of vaccines is very uneven across the world, we are back up and producing safelyin every major market, with the exception of Brazil and India. Assuming this continues, we’ll spendover $17 billion in cash on content this year and we’ll continue to deliver an amazing range of titlesfor our members with more originals this year than last. There are several facets to our content strategy.First and foremost, we want to deliver a wide varietyof best-in-class stories that our members love and watchin big numbers. Examples of this breadth in Q1 include season one ofFirefly Lane(49m chose to watchthis title in its first 28 days), season 3 ofCobra Kai(45m),Fate: The Winx Saga(57m), andGinny &Georgia(52m). Our top movies in Q1 includeI CareA Lot(56m),YES DAY(62m),Outside the Wire(66m) andthe last installment ofTo All the Boys I’ve Loved 3Beforetrilogy (51m). We program across many genres because tastes are very diverse. Even for one person, what they desire will vary widely dependingon their mood or who they are watching with. Another goal is to create great, locally authenticstories in countries all around the world. It’s whyour priority for local language titles is to have a bigimpact in the home territory so we don’t sacrificelocal impact for “travelability.” But we’re increasinglyseeing that these local titles find significant audiences around the world, which supports our thesis that greatstories are universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Notable standoutsthis quarter includeBelow Zerofrom Spain (47m chose to watch in its first four weeks),Space Sweepersfrom Korea (26m),Squared Lovefrom Poland (31m) andWho Killed Sara?from Mexico (an estimated55m), which is also our most popular non-English title ever in the US in its first 28 days(with season 2 launching on May 19). We want our titles to be talked about by audiencesacross the globe. Because of our broad distribution and highly engaged members, our titles not only generatehigh levels of viewing but also can pierce the cultural zeitgeist and transcend the film and TV industry. There were two recent standout examples of this:Lupin, our French language series about a daringgentleman burglar played by Omar Sy, was not only our most popular new title this quarter on Netflix(76m member households chose to watch in the first 28 days), but it alsopropelled book salesofthe novel in France;Lupin: Part 2will debut laterin Q2’21. Similarly, driven by the late December launchof season one ofBridgerton, Julia Quinn’s bookshit The New York Timesbestseller list for the first timein 18 years. Netflix led all studios for recent award nominationsincluding the Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG Awards, BAFTA and the NAACP Image Awards, among others. Headinginto the Academy Awards this weekend, we have 36 nominations across 17 films including twonominees in each of the Best Picture (Mank,The Trial of the Chicago 7), Best Documentary Feature(Crip Camp,My Octopus Teacher), and Best Animated Feature (Over the Moon,A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon)categories.Mankled all films with 10 nominations. Product We are constantly working to make it easier for membersto access and enjoy something they will love, regardless of their location or mood. In Q1, we launchedan opt-inDownloads for Youfeature for Android (with iOS coming soon) that automatically downloadsrecommended shows and movies onto a member's mobile device, ensuring that they alwayshave something to watch irrespective of connectivity. Knowing that bandwidth and storage canbe precious, this feature tries to choose only the most relevant content to download. This quarter we also launchedFast Laughs, a mobilefeed of short comedy clips from Netflix favorites- it's initially available in several countries includingthe US on iOS and will be on Android soon. For television viewers, this month we unveiled an updatedand improved experience for Kids Profile that more vividly and easilyconnects childrenwith theirfavorite titles and characters. 4Competition We compete with many activities for consumers’ entertainmenttime, ranging from watching linear TV, video gaming, and viewing user generated content,just to name a few. Against this backdrop, the entertainment market is huge, giving us plenty ofroom to grow, if we can continue to improve our service. We believe we are less than 10% of TV screentime in the US and even smaller in other regions and when including mobile devices. More and more new streaming services are launching,reinforcing our vision that linear TV will slowly give way to streaming entertainment. Despite our 10+year head start, we are continually seeking operational and creative excellence; we’re workingas hard as ever to continually improve our serviceso that we are the best entertainment option availablewith best in class stories, an ever-improving product experience and authentic local titles that our memberslove. Our ability to evolve from a DVD-by-mail to an internet entertainment business, from a US-onlyto a global service, and from a licensor of second window content to a producer of original content acrossso many different categories fuels our confidence and optimism for our next decade of challenges,growth and innovation. When comparing services, subscriber figures alonetell only part of the story (given bundles, discounts and other promotions) so it’s important to also focuson engagement and revenue as key indicators of success; they drive the flywheel of investment ineven more amazing stories for our members and future growth. It’s our job to please our members so muchon Monday, that on Tuesday, they start with us, and then they stick with us as their first choice forentertainment. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was$777 million vs. $260 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was$692 million vs. $162 million in Q1‘20. We are ontrack for full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximatelybreak even. As we discussed last quarter, we believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positiveand that we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repaid our 5.375% February1, 2021 bond ($500 million principal) out of balance sheet cash, reducing our total gross debt balanceto $15.7 billion as of March 31, 2021. We intend to maintain $10-$15 billion of gross debt. Our boardhas approved a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock beginning in 2021 with no fixedexpiration date. We expect our buyback program will begin this quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We’ve added a new section to our investor relationssite that collates all of ourESG informationforour investors, including our recently published2020 ESGReport(filed March 30, 2021). Our 2020 ESG report includes our commitment to achieve net zero greenhousegas emissions by the end of 2022. We also 2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cashprovided by (used in) operating activities, pleaserefer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attachedunaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5released our firstInclusion Reportaround the makeup of our workforce and a third-party diversity audit of our content by theUSC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative,designed to set industry benchmarks around these important issues.

       "  'In Q2, revenue increased 19% year over year to $7.3billion, while operating income rose 36% year over year to $1.8 billion. We finished the quarter withover 209m paid memberships, slightly ahead of our forecast. COVID has created some lumpiness in ourmembership growth (higher growth in 2020, slower growth this year), which is working its way through.We continue to focus on improving our service for our members and bringing them the best stories fromaround the world. Our summary results and forecast for Q3 are below. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Revenue growth was driven by an 11% increase in averagepaid streaming memberships and 8% growth in average revenue per membership (ARM)1. ARM rose4%, excluding a foreign exchange (FX) impact of +$277m. Operating margin of 25.2% expanded 3 percentagepoints compared with the year ago quarter. EPS of $2.97 vs. $1.59 a year ago included a $63mnon-cash unrealized loss from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The pandemic has created unusual choppiness in ourgrowth and distorts year-over-year comparisons as acquisition and engagement per member household spikedin the early months of COVID. In Q2’21, our engagement per member household was, as expected,down vs. those unprecedented levels but was still up 17% compared with a more comparable Q2’19. Similarly,retention continues to be strong and better than pre-COVID Q2’19 levels, even as average revenueper membership has grown 8% over this two-year 1Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number ofmonths in the period. These figures do not includesales taxes or VAT. 1period, demonstrating how much our members value Netflix and that as we improve our service we can charge a bit more. We added 1.5m paid memberships in Q2, slightly aheadof our 1.0m guidance forecast. The APAC region represented about two-thirds of our global paid net adds in the quarter. As expected, Q2 paid memberships in the UCAN region were slightly downsequentially (-0.4m paid net adds). We believe our large membership base in UCAN coupled with a seasonallysmaller quarter for acquisition is the main reason for this dynamic. This is similar to what weexperienced in Q2’19 when our UCAN paid net adds were -0.1m; since then we’ve added nearly 7.5m paidnet adds in UCAN. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide isour actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q3’21, we forecast paid net additions of 3.5mvs. 2.2m in the prior year period. If we achieve our forecast, we will have added more than 54m paid netadds over the past 24 months or 27m on an annualized basis over that time period, which is consistentwith our pre-COVID annual rate of net additions. We forecast that ARM will grow roughly5% year over year on a FX neutral basis in Q3’21. We continue to target a 20% operating margin for thefull year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. After our big global launch in January 2016, we committed to steadily growingour operating margin thereafter at an average rate of three percentage points per year over anyfew-year period. Some years we’ll be a little over(like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021).Assuming we achieve our margin target this year,we will have quintupled our operating margin in the lastfive years and are tracking ahead of this average annual three percentage point pace. 2With revenue and margin both increasing, our operatingprofit dollars have risen dramatically as well (even as we have been investing heavily), from about$100 million per quarter in 2016 to nearly $2 billion per quarter so far in 2021. Our belief isthat as we steadily improve our service to betterplease our members, this will lead to continued growth inour membership base, ARM, revenue, operating margin and profit dollars. Content We launched our first original scripted TV seriesin 2012 and we’ve since expanded our original programming effort to many additional categories,from all over the world. Our goal is to be everyone’s first choice for entertainment because of the varietyand quality of our titles. And despite the COVID-related production delays in 2020, we were ableto deliver an exciting portfolio of titles in Q2’21 that exemplify this ambition. For example,Shadow and Bone, a fantasy series basedon the popularGrishaverse book series, proved to be very popular with our members. Over 55m memberhouseholds chose to watch this show in its first 28 days and we’ve renewed it for a second season.Sweet Tooth, based on the beloved DC comic, was another hit series with 60m member households choosingthis title in its first four weeks. Our expansion into non-fiction series is going well.This past quarter, standout unscripted titles include season two of dating showToo Hot to Handleand socialexperiment reality programThe Circle(an estimated 29m and 14m, respectively, chose to watchin the first 28 days) as well as the true crime docu-seriesThe Sons of Sam(19m). We’re buildingout some of these unscripted titles with local versions of the same formats. As one example,TooHot to Handle: BrazilandToo Hot to Handle: Latino will be launching later in July and September, respectively,to serve our LATAM region. 3We’re also quickly growing both our live action and animated original film offering, with several impactful titles in Q2. Zack Snyder’sArmy of the Deadwas a blockbuster as 75m member households chose to watch this action packed zombie spectaclein its first 28 days of release. As an extensionto Army of the Dead, a prequel,Army of Thieves, willbe released in Q4’21 along with a spinoff anime series later in 2022.Fatherhood, a dramedy starring KevinHart, was another hit, drawing an estimated 74m member households in its first 28 days. And Q2 alsofeatured our biggest Netflix animated film to date with 53m member households choosing to watchThe Mitchellsvs. The Machines. Last week, Netflix series and specials received 129Emmy nominations. With 24 nominations,The Crown tied for the most nominated series.Bridgertonwith12 nominations was also nominated for Best Drama series whileThe Queen’s Gambitreceived 18 nominationsincluding Best Limited Series.Cobra Kai,Emily In Parisand the finale season ofThe Kominsky Methodwere all nominated for Best Comedy series. Beyond this acclaim, these are also among our popularseries on Netflix. Our non-English content investments are growing bothin scope and impact. Our P&L content expense for this content category has more than doubled inthe past two years. Illustrating how great storiescan come from anywhere and be loved everywhere, part twoofLupinfrom France was our largest non-English title in the quarter with 54m member householdschoosing this title in its first four weeks. Season four ofElitefrom Spain drew 37m member householdsin its first 28 days, while season two of Who Killed Sara?built on the success of the firstseason with 34m households choosing the latest installment of this gripping thriller from Mexico. As discussed in previous letters, COVID-related productiondelays in 2020 have led to a lighter first half of 2021 slate that will build through the course of theyear. In the first six months of 2021, content amortization grew only 9% year over year (as comparedto 17% in FY20). COVID and its variants make predicting the future hard, but with productions largelyrunning smoothly so far, we’re optimistic in our ability to deliver a strong second half slate. Throughthe first half of 2021 we’ve already spent $8 billion in cash on content (up 41% yr-over-yr and 1.4x ourcontent amortization) and we expect content amortization to be around $12 billion for the fullyear (+12% year over year). Our Q3 slate will include new seasons of fan favoritesLa Casa de Papel(akaMoney Heist),Sex Education, Virgin RiverandNever Have I Everas well as live action films includingSweet Girl (starring Jason Momoa),Kissing Booth3, and Kate(starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the animatedfeature filmVivo, featuring all-new songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda. We’re also in the early stages of further expandinginto games, building on our earlier efforts around interactivity (eg,Black Mirror Bandersnatch) andourStranger Thingsgames. We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansioninto original films, animation and unscripted TV. Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscriptionat no additional cost similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games formobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our movies and TV series offering and we expect a long runwayof increasing investment and growth across all ofour existing content categories, but since we are nearlya decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about howour members value games. Product 4We’re constantly innovating across a broad range of areas to improve the viewing experience and better serve our members. That’s why this quarter we globallylaunchedPlay Somethingon television, ournew featurethat lets Netflix do the work when you don’tfeel like choosing what to watch. Recognizing that broadband quality and cost varies around the world,we also improved the Netflix download experience to enable you to start watching a show or film evenif it hasn’t finished downloading. Once you reconnect, you can complete the partial download andkeep watching — also helping members avoid exceeding their data limits. We recently expanded our low-cost mobile-only planto an additional 78 countries across South East Asia and sub-saharan Africa. Like in our other markets,this plan complements our existing three tiers of service. In the five markets where we had previouslylaunched a mobile-only plan, we have found that the mobile only plan has been an effective way tointroduce more consumers to Netflix while being roughly revenue neutral as the lower average revenueper membership is offset by incremental acquisition and generally better retention. Competition We are still very much in the early days of the transitionfrom linear to on-demand consumption of entertainment. Streaming represents just 27% of USTV screen time, compared with 63% for linear television, according to Nielsen. Based on this samestudy, Nielsen estimates that we are just 7% of US TV screen time. Considering that we are less maturein other countries and that this excludes mobile screens (where we believe our share of engagementis even lower), we are confident that we have a long runway for growth. As we improve our service, ourgoal is to continue to increase our share of screen time in the US and around the world. 5Share of Total US TV Time, June 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) The planned combination of Warner Media Group andDiscovery and Amazon’s pending acquisition of MGM are examples of the ongoing industry consolidationas firms adapt to a world where streaming supplants linear TV. The industry has consolidatedmaterially over the years (Time Warner/AT&T, Viacom/CBS, Discovery/Scripps, Disney/Fox, Comcast/NBCU/Sky,etc.) and we don’t believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if atall. While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as “must-have” and we haven’tyet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon. In the race to entertain consumers around the world,we continue to compete for screen time with a broad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok(to name just a few). But, we are mostly competing with ourselves to improve our service asfast as we can. If we can do that, we’re confidentwe can maintain our strong position and continue to grownicely as we have been over the past two-plus decades. Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q2, net cash generated by operating activitieswas -$64 million vs. $1 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was-$175 million vs. $899 million in Q2‘20. FCF in lastyear’s Q2 benefited from COVID-related production shutdowns.We are still expecting full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately break even. As we discussedpreviously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-dayoperations. 2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cashprovided by (used in) operating activities, pleaserefer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unauditedfinancial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6During Q2, we increased our revolving credit facility (which remains undrawn) to $1 billion from $750 million and extended the maturity from 2024 to 2026.We also repurchased 1m shares for $500 million (at an average per share price of about $500) underour $5 billion share authorization. Our main priority is to invest in the organic growth of our business while maintaining strong liquidity and retaining financial flexibility for strategic investments. Ourgrowing operating profit allows us to complementthis priority with a return of capital to shareholders. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In June, the independent sustainability think tankThe Carbon Trustpublished awhite paperexamining the carbon impact of video streaming.Key findingsof the work include:  The average carbon footprint for Europe per hour ofvideo streaming is approximately 55gCO2e, equivalent to driving 250 metres in an average petrolcar.  Devices (TVs, laptops/PCs, smartphones, tablets) makeup the largest portion of carbon emissions from streaming (over 50%), compared to othercomponents like energy from data centers or networks. Good news: Devices are gettingmore efficient over time and total device usage is fairly constant (with Netflix gaining sharefrom linear).  Changing resolutions and other viewing settings werefound to result in only a very small change in the carbon impact. Changing from standard definitionto 4K resolution grows transmission emissions from just under 1g CO2e/hour to just over1g CO2e/hour.  As demand for streaming and other internet servicesincreases, the carbon intensity of these services will decrease over time. This is due to (1)networking equipment becoming less energy-intensive with technological advances, and(2) increased use of renewable electricity. As a reminder, our ESG-related information can befound on ourIR website.

       "  'After a lighter-than-normal content slate in Q1 and Q2 due to COVID-related production delays in 2020, we are seeing the positive effects of a stronger slate in the second half of the year. In Q3, we grew revenue 16% year over year to $7.5 billion, while operating income rose 33% vs. the prior year quarter to $1.8 billion. We added 4.4m paid net adds (vs. 2.2m in Q3’20) to end the quarter with 214m paid memberships. We’re very excited to finish the year with what we expect to be our strongest Q4 content offering yet, which shows up as bigger content expense and lower operating margins sequentially. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 9% and 7% increase in average paid streaming memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding a foreign exchange (FX)impact of +$128m, ARM rose 5% year over year. Operating margin for Q3 amounted to 23.5%, a three percentage point increase vs. the year ago period. This was above our beginning of quarter forecast due to the timing of content spend, as well as lower than forecasted marketing spend. EPS of $3.19 vs. $1.74 a year ago included a $136m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We under-forecasted paid net adds for the quarter (4.4m actual vs. our 3.5m projection), while ending paid memberships of 214m was within 0.4% of our forecast. For the second consecutive quarter, the APAC region was our largest contributor to membership growth with 2.2m paid net adds (half of total paid net adds) as we are continuing to improve our service in this region. In EMEA, paid net adds of 1.8m improved sequentially vs. the 188k in Q2 as several titles had a particularly strong impact. The UCAN and 1ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1LATAM regions grew paid memberships more slowly. These regions have higher penetration of broadband homes although we believe we still have ample runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q4’21, we forecast paid net adds of 8.5m, consistent with Q4’20 paid net additions. For the full year 2021, we forecast an operating margin of 20% or slightly better. This means that Q4’21 operating margin will be approximately 6.5% compared with 14% in Q4’20. The year over year decline in operating margin is due mostly to our backloaded big content release schedule in this Q4, which will result in a roughly 19% year over year increase in content amortization for Q4’21 (compared with ~8% growth year to date). Content Our programming strategy is to provide members with a wide variety of high quality content that’s loved and watched in large numbers. Season five ofLa Casade Papel(akaMoney Heist) and season three of Sex Educationwere two of our biggest returning showsin the quarter with 69m and 55m member households, respectively, choosing to watch these fan favorites in the first four weeks. On the heels of The Queen’s Gambit, we’ve had another limited serieshit withMaidwhich launched just after quarter-end on October 1. We expect this story about living on the poverty line by award-winning playwright and screenwriter Molly Smith Metzler to reach 67m households during its first four weeks. La Casa de Papelwas our first non-English languagetitle to show that - with subtitling and dubbing - great stories truly can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world. While the goal of our local content executives is always to create locally authentic stories that will resonate in their country (likeThe Chestnut Manwhich we expect to be watched by 2approximately two thirds of our Danish members during its first four weeks), Netflix is a global, direct-to-consumer service which enables creators to reach broader audiences - and gives our members an even greater choice of stories to enjoy. There is no better example of this thanSquid Game,a unique Korean story that first captured the zeitgeist in Korea and then globally. Released on September 17, it has becomeour biggest TV show ever. A mind-boggling142mmember households globally havechosen to watch the title in its first four weeks. The breadth ofSquid Game’s popularity is truly amazing;this show has been ranked as our #1 program in 94 countries (including the US). Like some of our other big hits,Squid Gamehas also pierced the cultural zeitgeist, spawning aSaturday Night Liveskitandmemes/clips on TikTokwith more than 42 billion views. Demand for consumer products to celebrate the fandom forSquid Gameis high and those items are on their way to retail now. Our film slate also continues to build with a variety of successful Q3 titles such as action filmSweetGirl starring Jason Momoa (68m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks),Kissing Booth 3 (59m), the last installment in the rom com trilogy, the animated family filmVivo(46m) andBlood Red Sky, a German-language action horror movie (53m). Later in the year, we will shift to reporting on hours viewed for our titles rather than the number of accounts that choose to watch them. There is some difference in rankings, as you see below, but we think engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction. It also matches how outside services measure TV viewing and gives proper credit to rewatching. In addition, we will start to release title metrics more regularly outside of our earnings report so our members and the industry can better measure success in the streaming world. 3* Total hours viewed per title in its first 28 days on Netflix. ** The number of accounts that have watched at least two minutes of that title in its first 28 days on Netflix. Data as of 9/27/21. We’re honored to have garnered the most Emmys ever for any single network or service in a season of television, with 44 (tying CBS’ tally in 1974 when there were only three national networks). This included our first best Drama series win (The Crown), whileThe Queen’s Gambitwon 11 out of 18 nominations, including the coveted best limited series. Both titles are among our most popular ever, demonstrating critical and commercial success. During Q3, we announced our agreement to acquire theRoald Dahl Story Company, pending regulatory approval. This was an opportunity to purchase a beloved and enduring portfolio of intellectual property includingCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,Matilda,The BFG,James and the Giant Peach,Fantastic Mr. FoxandThe Twits, to name just a few. Roald Dahl’sbooks have been translated into 63 languages and have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. Once we close, we’ll be looking to develop even more of these stories into new formats across the live action television and films, animation and pre-school categories. We’ve begun testing our games offering in select countries. It remains very early days for this initiative and, like other content categories we’ve expanded into, we plan to try different types of games, learn from our members and improve our game library. During Q3, we acquiredNight School Studio, the maker of critically acclaimed games likeOXENFREE,to help build out our game development capabilities. 4As a reminder, games on Netflix will be included in members’ subscriptions and will not have advertisements or in-app purchases so game play is purely focused on enjoyment versus monetization. We’re eagerly anticipating the rest of our Q4 slate, which includes a great mix of popular returning English language series likeThe Witcher,You, TigerKingandCobra Kai, big returning non-English series likeSintoniaand the final chapter ofLa Casa dePapel(akaMoney Heist), as well as exciting new movies such as the action filmRed Notice(starring DwayneJohnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds),Don’t Look Upwith an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio,Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep, as well asThe Harder They FallfeaturingJonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, LaKeith Stanfield, Regina King and Idris Elba,Army of Thieves(the prequel to ourhit movie,Army of the Dead) andThe UnforgivablestarringSandra Bullock, Viola Davis and Jon Bernthal. The latest films from acclaimed directors Jane Campion (The Power Of The Dog) and Paolo Sorrentino (The Hand of God) are also coming to Netflix in Q4. Assuming no new Covid waves or unforeseen events that result in large scale production shutdowns, we currently anticipate a more normalized content slate in 2022, with a greater number of originals in 2022 vs. 2021 and a release schedule that is more balanced over the course of the year, as compared to 2021. Product We try many different approaches to see what might help our growth. One example in Q3 was the launch of a free plan for mobile users in Kenya. This plan is a great way for anyone in Kenya with an Android mobile phone to explore Netflix - with access to great content, personalized recommendations, and parental controls. We hope that this encourages more people to sign up for a paid membership so that they can watch Netflix on any device (mobile, TV, or laptop), access more features (e.g. downloads) and enjoy our entire catalog. It will take a year or two to determine if this technique helps our paid membership growth or not. We know that members most value the variety and quality of our content. Great recommendations are key to ensuring they can experience that breadth and diversity. So we continue to invest in our recommendations to ensure members can easily find great stories to enjoy on our service. One example of our ability to surface relevant programming isManifest, a TV series that aired on NBC for three seasons and was subsequently cancelled in June 2021. We addedManifestto our service in the US and Canada during the summer of 2021. In the UCAN region, 25m member households chose to watch this title in its first 28 days and we’ve ordered a fourth and final season given the popularity of the show. Marketing & Communications In addition to having best in class content and a product experience that allows members to easily find shows and movies they love, we also want our programming to be talked about and in the cultural zeitgeist. In September, we held our first global fan event,TUDUM, which featured news, first looksand trailers from over 100 of the most anticipated Netflix films and series of the next 12 months. TUDUM was a new way for us to connect fans with our titles, talent and brand and to drive conversation at a global scale and trended at #2 globally the day of the event on Twitter. Additionally, TUDUM and the 5trailers/content released following the event were watched by fans in over 180 countries, generating close to 700m views and more than 3 billion impressions in less than four days. Competition We compete with a staggeringly large set of activities for consumers’ time and attention like watching linear TV, reading a book, browsing TikTok, or playing Fortnite, to name just a few. As one example of this dynamic, on October 4, when Facebook experienced a global outage for several hours, our engagement saw a 14% increase during this time period. We are still quite small, with a lot of opportunity for growth; in our largest and most penetrated market, according to Nielsen, we are still less than 10% of US television screen time. Our approach as always is to improve our service as quickly as we can so that we can earn a greater share of people’s time. Share of Total US TV Time, September 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $82 million vs. $1.3 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)2for the quarter was-$106 million vs. $1.1 billion in Q3‘20. FCF in last year’s Q3 was helped by COVID-related production shutdowns. Year to date FCF is $410m. With production volume ramping successfully and a lower operating margin in Q4, we anticipate Q4 ‘21 FCF to be negative. We continue to expect full year 2021 FCF to be approximately breakeven (plus or minus several hundred million dollars depending on the timing of production starts and related cash spending on content). We anticipate being FCF positive on an annual basis in 2022 and beyond. 2For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6As we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repurchased 0.2m shares for $100 million. Our slower buyback pace this quarter reflects the pick up in our M&A activity. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above and beyond our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In March, we committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022 and to reduce our emissions to be in line with the latest climate science, ensuring that our internal reductions are consistent with a trajectory of no more than 1.5℃ of warming. We’ve been making progress on this initiative. We provided an update in Septemberhere.

       "  \"We achieved several milestones in 2021: we had the biggest TV show of the year (Squid Game), our two biggest film releases of all time (Red NoticeandDon’t Look Up) and Netflix was the most Emmy-winning and most nominated TV network and the most Oscar-winning and nominated movie studio of 2021. Full year revenue of $30 billion grew 19% year over year while operating income of $6.2 billion rose 35% year over year. We finished Q4 with 222m paid memberships (with 8.3m paid net adds in Q4). Even in a world of uncertainty and increasing competition, we’re optimistic about our long-term growth prospects as streaming supplants linear entertainment around the world. We're continually improving Netflix so that we can please our members, grow our share of leisure time and lead in this transition. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Revenue in Q4’21 grew 16% year over year with a 9% increase in average paid memberships. ARM1rose 7% year over year on both a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, two percentage points faster than Q3’21 (ex-F/X). Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 8%, a six percentage point decrease vs. the year ago period. The decline in operating margin was expected given our large content slate in Q4 this year. Operating margin was above our beginning of quarter forecast of 6.5% due to slightly lower than forecasted content spend. As a result, our full year operating margin was 21% vs. 18% in 2020, 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1above our 20% guidance forecast. EPS in Q4 of $1.33 vs. $1.19 a year ago included a $104m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We slightly over-forecasted paid net adds in Q4 (8.3m actual compared to the 8.5m paid net adds in both the year ago quarter and our beginning of quarter projection). For the full year 2021, paid net adds totaled 18m vs 37m in 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with more than 90% of our paid net adds in 2021 coming from outside the UCAN region. Nonetheless, our UCAN region added 1.2m paid memberships in Q4’21 (vs. 0.9m last year), marking our strongest quarter of member growth in this region since the early days of COVID-19 in 2020. In APAC, we increased paid memberships by 2.6m (vs. 2.0m in the year ago quarter) with strong growth in both Japan and India. EMEA was our largest contributor to paid net adds in Q4 (3.5m vs. 4.5m in the prior year period) and the region delivered record quarterly revenue, exceeding $2.5 billion for the first time. LATAM paid net adds totaled 1.0m vs. 1.2m last year. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and in others it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net adds performance vs. forecast. For Q1’22, we forecast paid net adds of 2.5m vs. 4.0m in the year ago quarter. Our guidance reflects a more back-end weighted content slate in Q1’22 (for example,BridgertonS2 and our new original film The Adam Projectwill both be launching in March).In addition, while retention and engagement remain healthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels. We think this may be due to several factors including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts of the world like LATAM. 2For 2022, we are currently targeting an operating margin of 19%-20% (assuming no material swings in foreign currency from current levels). Our operating margin outlook is driven by two main factors. First, as seen in the chart below, we delivered above the three percentage point annual linear progression over the past two years (average of four percentage points per year). Second, theUS dollar has strengthened meaningfullyagainst most other currencies. With ~60% of our revenue outside of the US due to our international success, we estimate that the US dollar’s appreciation over the past six months has cost us roughly $1 billion in expected 2022 revenue (as a reminder, we don’t hedge). With the vast majority of our expenses in US dollars, this translates into an estimated two percentage point negative impact on our 2022 operating margin. As we have written in the past, over the medium term we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. In the near term, we want to continue to invest appropriately in our business and don’t want to over-react to F/X fluctuations to the detriment of our long term growth. There is no change to our goal of steadily growing our operating margin at an average increase of three percentage points per year over any few year period. 3Content Our Q4 content slate epitomizes what we strive for: a wide variety of quality TV series and films. We had a number of big hits in Q4. We released new seasons of returning shows likeThe Witcher(484 million hours viewed2),You(468m hours viewed),Emily inParis(287 million hours viewed) and on December 31, Cobra Kai(274m hours viewed*), as well as the criticallyacclaimed limited seriesMaid(469m hours viewed). The dystopian Korean thrillerSquid Game- a late Q3 release that broke through globally early in Q4 - generated 1.65 billion hours viewed in its first four weeks and is now our biggest TV season ever. The fourth quarter also featured the conclusion to one of our most popular shows -La Casa de Papelaka Money Heist(6.7 billion hours viewed over its lifetime).We’re excited to expand theLCDPuniverse with our Korean adaptation,Money Heist: Korea - JointEconomic Area, launching later this year. Over the years, we’ve learned that big hits can come from anywhere in the world (with great subtitles and dubbing), as we’ve seen withLa Casa de Papel,Squid Game, andLupinto name just a few. But our goal with non-English originals is to first and foremost thrill audiences in their home country. And in the quarter, we saw big local viewing for titles such asLove is Blind Brazil,My Namefrom Korea, superhero filmMinnal Muralifrom India and Danish thrillerThe Chestnut Man. Film is incredibly important for our members, which is why our ambition has always been to work with the world’s best filmmakers and stars to create a wide variety of quality movies. We took a large step forward in Q4 on this front with our biggest film slate ever. Our blockbusterRed Notice(starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds) quickly became our most popular movie launch of all-time with 364 million hours viewed in its first four weeks. Other hits this quarter includeThe Unforgivable,starring 2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through January 18, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 4Sandra Bullock (215m hours viewed),Army of the DeadprequelArmy of Thieves(158m hours viewed), feel-good holiday romcomLove Hardwith Jimmy O. Yangand Nina Dobrev (134m hours viewed), animated featureBack to the Outback(105m hours viewed)andThe Harder They Fall(122m hours viewed). On Christmas Eve, we released the star-studded satireDon’t Look Up(featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep), which is already our second most popular film ever with 353m* hours viewed. Overall in 2021, Netflix series accounted for six out of the 10 most searched shows globally while our films represented two of the top 10. Google Year in Search, 2021 (Global) In November we debuted our mobile games experience globally on Android and iOS. Members can now discover and launch games from within the Netflix mobile app. Since launch, we released an additional five games, bringing the total to ten for 2021. It’s still very early days but we’re pleased with our progress. In 2022, we’ll expand our portfolio of games across both casual and core gaming genres as we continue to program a breadth of game types to learn what our members enjoy most. Marketing & Communications One of our goals with marketing is to help drive conversation about and passion for our titles. We know that Netflix fans want to dive deeper into what they watch with behind-the-scenes details, interviews, and updates. To make it easier and more engaging for our fans, we’ve launched the siteTudum(named after our “sonic logo”) as a home for extending stories and conversation and further building fandom for our TV shows and films. Product & Pricing Netflix offers a wide variety of TV shows and films to its members, which we know they value. We also work hard to make it easy for members to access this content. For instance, in October, we introduced voice-driven Play Something, first on Amazon Fire TV devices (TVs, sticks, and set top boxes). Now, members can simply say “Play Something on Netflix” or “Play a movie on Netflix” and playback will start 5regardless of whether you are browsing Netflix or another service. If they don’t like what’s playing, simply saying “play something else” or “next” will play the next title in the list. Voice-driven Play Something makes choosing effectively effortless. In December, welowered our pricesin India acrossall four plans. India is fairly unique because pay TV pricing is very low. We believe these new prices will make Netflix more accessible to a broader swath of the population - strengthening our value perception. Our goal is to maximize long term revenue in each of our markets. Competition Consumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time - competition that has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering. While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth some, we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched. This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition from linear to streaming and that with under 10% of total TV screen time in the US, our biggest market, Netflix has tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$403 million vs. -$138 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)3for the quarter was-$569 million vs. -$284 million in Q4‘20. For the full year 2021, FCF amounted to -$159 million, in-line with our expectation for “approximately break-even.” We didn’t engage in share repurchases in Q4 as we funded our acquisition of the Roald Dahl Story Company from cash on hand during the quarter. We anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We’re also targeting $10-$15 billion of gross debt. We finished Q4 with gross debt of $15.5 billion and we’ll pay down $700 million of our senior notes due in Q1’22. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) While our current governance structure has served our shareholders extraordinarily well with a sustained period of substantial growth, we’ve clearly proven our business model: streaming is now an established business, we’re self-funding and expect sustained positive free cash flow, and we’ve substantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margin. So the Netflix Board has decided to evolve to a more standard large-cap governance structure and will recommend several changes at our 3For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6next annual meeting. These include declassifying our board, removing supermajority voting provisions in our charter and bylaws, and enabling shareholders to call special meetings. We will also change the voting standard for our directors in uncontested elections.

       "  \"Our revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show. Streaming is winning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently. While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth - through improvements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing - we’ll be holding our operating margin at around 20%. Key to our success has been our ability to create amazing entertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewing than our competitors. These are Netflix's core strengths and competitive advantages. Together with our strong profitability, we believe we have the foundation from which we can both significantly improve, and better monetize, our service longer term. Growth Outlook Since launching streaming in 2007, we’ve operated under the firm belief that internet-delivered, on demand entertainment will supplant linear TV, and that this transition represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a highly popular and profitable entertainment company. People love movies, TV shows and games; broadband and smart TV penetration continue to grow globally with more and more connected devices; and while hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world’s broadband homes don’t yet, representing huge future growth potential. 1In the near term though, we’re not growing revenue as fast as we’d like. COVID clouded the picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021 was due to the COVID pull forward. Now, we believe there are four main inter-related factors at work. First, it’s increasingly clear that the pace of growthinto our underlying addressable market (broadband homes) is partly dependent on factors we don’t directly control, like the uptake of connected TVs (since the majority of our viewing is on TVs), the adoption of on-demand entertainment, and data costs. We believe these factors will keep improving over time, so that all broadband households will be potential Netflix customers. Second, in addition to our 222m paying households,we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over 100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region. Account sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn’t changed much over the years, but, coupled with the first factor, means it’s harder to grow membership in many markets - an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth. Third, competition for viewing with linear TV as wellas YouTube, Amazon, and Hulu has been robust for the last 15 years. However, over the last three years, as traditional entertainment companies realized streaming is the future, many new streaming services have also launched. While our US television viewing share, for example, has been steady to up according to Nielsen, we want to grow that share faster. Higher view share is an indicator of higher satisfaction, which supports higher retention and revenue. Fourth, macro factors, including sluggish economicgrowth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID are likely having an impact as well. 2Our plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix - in particular the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our members value most. On the content side, we’re doubling down on story development and creative excellence, which we see reflected in big Q1’22 TV hits likeBridgerton(627 million hours viewed for season 21*, our biggest English language series in our history) andInventing Anna(512m hours viewed) - both from our extremely successful partnership with Shonda Rhimes - and films likeTinder Swindler(166m hours viewed, our biggest documentary film ever released) andThe Adam Project(233m hours viewed), which come on the back of our Q4 hitsRed NoticeandDon’tLook Up. On the product side, we recently launched “double thumbs up” so members can better express what they truly love versus simply like - enabling us to continue to improve our personalized recommendations and overall experience. This focus on continuous improvement has served us well over the past 25 years - from our big battle with Blockbuster nearly 20 years ago through the launch and growth of streaming, to the switch from licensed second run TV series and films to original programming, and our development from a domestic business with primarily English language content to a global entertainment service. It’s why we are now the largest subscription streaming service in the world on all key metrics: paid memberships, engagement, revenue and profit. Another focus is how best to monetize sharing - the 100M+ households using another household’s account. This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying our service. Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. And we've always tried to make sharingwithina member’shousehold easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams. While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households. So early last year we started testing different approaches to monetize sharing and, in March, introduced two newpaid sharing features, where current members have the choice to pay for additional households, in three markets in Latin America. There’s a broad range of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing. So while we won’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity. As we work to monetize sharing, growth in ARM, revenue and viewing will become more important indicators of our success than membership growth. Over the longer term, much of our growth will come from outside the US. Traditionally, US entertainment companies have viewed “international” as an export market for US content. But we saw long ago that great stories can be made anywhere and loved everywhere - dramatically broadening the pool of creators with whom we can work, increasing the variety of our programming and better serving local tastes. To support this, we’ve been building out capabilities like creative development, personalization, and language presentation/localization. Netflix is now producing films and TV in more than 50 countries with a high degree of integration in the local entertainment ecosystem resulting in the creation of blockbusters from every region. In fact, three out of our six most popular TV seasons of all time are non-English language titles:Squid Game,La Casa de PapelPart 4 andAll Of Us Are Dead, which 1Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through April 17, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 3launched in Q1’22 and has accumulated 561m hours viewed in its first four weeks. So an important focus is working to extend our lead in this area. Our goal is to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating income even faster (as we expand margins) and generate growing positive free cash flow (FCF). During this period of slower revenue growth, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange (F/X), we aim to protect our profitability and manage to a minimum operating margin roughly in line with current levels (i.e., this year’s 19-20% guidance). Once we’ve re-accelerated revenue growth, we’re committed to steadily growing our operating margin. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Our 10% revenue growth in Q1’22 was driven by an 8% year over year increase in average streaming paid memberships and 2% year over year growth in ARM2.Excluding a F/X impact of -$280 million, year over year revenue and ARM growth were +14% and +6%, respectively. Operating income of $2.0 billion was above our beginning of quarter forecast of $1.8 billion due to lower than projected content expense. EPS of $3.53 vs. $3.75 a year ago included a $162 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Paid net additions were -0.2m compared against our guidance forecast of 2.5m and 4.0m in the same quarter a year ago. The suspension of our service in Russia and winding-down of all Russian paid memberships resulted in a -0.7m impact on paid net adds; excluding this impact, paid net additions totaled +0.5m. The main challenge for membership growth is continued soft acquisition across all regions. Retention was also slightly lower relative to our guidance forecast, although it remains at a very healthy level (we believe among the best in the industry). Recent price changes are largely tracking in-line with our expectations and remain significantly revenue positive. In EMEA (-0.3M paid net adds, or +0.4m excluding the Russia impact), we saw a slowdown in our business in Central and Eastern Europe in March, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Paid net additions in LATAM totaled -0.4M; similar to recent quarters, we believe a combination of forces including macroeconomic weakness and our price changes (F/X neutral ARM grew 20% year over year) were a drag on our membership growth. UCAN paid net adds of -0.6M was largely the result of our price change which is tracking in-line with our expectations and is significantly revenue positive. We’re making good progress in APAC where we are seeing nice growth in a variety of markets including Japan, India, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2’22, we forecast paid net additions of -2.0m vs. +1.5m in the year ago quarter. Our forecast assumes our current trends persist (such as slow acquisition and the near term impact of price changes) plus typical seasonality (Q2 paid net adds are usually less than Q1 paid net adds). We project revenue to grow approximately 10% year over year in Q2, assuming roughly a mid-to-high single digit year over year 2ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 4increase in ARM on a F/X neutral basis. We still target a 19%-20% operating margin for the full year 2022, assuming no material swings in F/X rates from when we set this goal in January of 2022. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $923 million vs. $777 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow3amounted to $802 million vs.$692 million. We continue to expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. During the quarter, we completed two acquisitions (leading visual effects companyScanlineand gaming studioBoss Fight Entertainment), which had a -$125million impact on cash. We also announced our purchase of Helsinki-based gaming companyNext Games.We’ve completed the tender offer and expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2022. We finished Q1 with gross debt of $14.6 billion after repaying $700 million of our senior notes. We’re now within the top end of our gross debt target range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $6.0 billion, net debt was $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter, equating to a 1.3x LTM leverage ratio4. Given those uses of cash and our minimum cash target, we didn’t engage in share repurchase activity during the quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We recently published our2021 ESG Report(March 30,2022). We’ve made good progress on ourclimate commitmentsannounced last year - reducing or avoidingmore than 14,000 metric tons of emissions in 2021. This enabled us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 footprint by more than 10% from what it otherwise would have been and puts us on track to cut 45% of these emissions by 2030. We continue to develop our inclusion lens. In 2021, women made up 51.7% of our global workforce5, up from 48.7% in 2020. Half of our US workforce (50.5%) is made up of people from one or more historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds, including Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern, Native American, and Pacific Islander6. That’s upfrom 46.8% in the previous year. The number of US Black employees increased from 8.6% to 10.7% and Black leadership increased from 10.9% to 13.3%. The number of US Hispanic or Latino employees increased from 7.9% to 8.6%, and US Hispanic or Latino leadership grew slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%. As noted in our last investor letter and our2022preliminary proxy, the board has decided to recommend to shareholders that Netflix evolve to a more standard large cap company governance structure. At this year’s annual meeting in June, we’ll present proposals to declassify our board, remove supermajority 3For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cashprovided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 4Defined as net debt divided by last twelve months(LTM) adjusted EBITDA (Net income before interest expense and other income/expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and further adjusted to exclude other non-cash charges). 52020 numbers as of December 2020, and 2021 numbersas of December 2021. 6Categories based on US reporting requirements. 5voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings.

       "  'Q2 was better-than-expected on membership growth, and foreign exchange was worse-than-expected (stronger US dollar), resulting in 9% revenue growth (13% constant currency). Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product, content, and marketing as we’ve done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience. We’re in a position of strength given our $30 billion-plus in revenue, $6 billion in operating profit last year, growing free cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q2 Results Revenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year (or 13% excluding a -$339 million foreign currency impact), driven by a 6% and 2% increase in average paid memberships and ARM1, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), ARM rose 7% year over year. The appreciation of the US dollar (USD) vs. most other currencies since our April earnings report was the primary reason for the variance to our revenue guidance forecast. We slightly under-forecasted global paid net adds in Q2 (-1.0m vs. -2.0m forecast and compared to +1.5m in the year ago quarter).  In APAC, revenue grew 23% year over year, excluding F/X. At over $900 million of revenue, APAC is approaching the size of our LATAM business. We added 1.1m paid memberships in the region (vs. 1.0m last Q2). ARM in APAC was -2% year over year on a F/X neutral basis, due to the impact from our price decrease in India last December as well as plan mix, which was partially offset by 1ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1higher ARM in Korea and Australia. Excluding India, APAC ARM grew 4% year over year on a constant currency basis.  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM increased 13% and 6% year over year, respectively, while paid net additions totaled -0.8m vs. 0.2m in the year ago quarter.  Revenue in LATAM grew 19% year over year excluding F/X and surpassed the $1 billion quarterly mark for the first time, helped by constant currency ARM growth of 15%. Paid memberships were flat sequentially (compared to 0.8m paid net adds in Q2’21).  In UCAN, ARM and revenue each increased 10% year over year, excluding the impact of F/X. Paid net adds were -1.3m vs. -0.4m in the year ago period. Retention improved over the course of the quarter and, while churn remains slightly elevated, it is now back near pre-price change levels. We’ve adjusted our cost structure for our current rate of revenue growth. This resulted in approximately $70 million of severance costs and an $80m non-cash impairment of certain real estate leases primarily related to rightsizing our office footprint. Excluding these items totaling $150 million, and the F/X impact of the stronger US dollar since our April report, operating profit and operating margin were slightly ahead of our guidance forecast. EPS of $3.20 vs. $2.97 a year ago exceeded our guidance forecast of $3.00 due to a $305 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” Our approximately $5 billion of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge against the Euro for net income, but doesn’t affect operating income. Year to date, our gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro debt is $467 million. Q3 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the current uncertain macro-economic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. The US dollar continues to strengthen meaningfully against most currencies at ahistoric pace, withthe Euro recently falling below the US dollarfor thefirst time in two decades, a significant headwind for all multinational US companies. We have high exposure to this unprecedented appreciation in the USD because nearly 60% of our revenue comes from outside the US and swings in F/X have a large flow through to operating profit as most of our expenses are in USD and don’t benefit from a stronger USD. Our Q3 revenue growth forecast of 5% translates into 12% year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Similarly, excluding the impact of currency, operating profit growth would be -3% year over year (vs our forecast decline of -29%) and operating margin would be 20% (vs our forecast of 16%). As we have written in the past, over the medium term, we intend to continue to adjust our business as appropriate given the relative strength of the USD to protect our operating margin and try to avoid immediate actions that we believe could be detrimental to the business. We forecast paid net adds for Q3 of +1.0m vs. 4.4m in the year ago quarter. We continue to expect full year 2022 operating margin of 19%-20%, excluding the unanticipated $150m of restructuring costs in Q2 2noted above and the material movement in F/X from January 2022, as our guidance was set based on F/X at that time (see ourQ4’21 letter). Content, Marketing, and Product Last quarter, we discussed our slowing revenue growth, which we believe is the result of connected TV adoption, account sharing, competition, and macro factors such as sluggish economic growth and the impacts of the war in Ukraine. We’ve now had more time to understand these issues, as well as how best to address them. First and foremost, we need to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix. This focus on improving our core service has served us well over the past 25 years, and remains our north star to drive continuous growth. It’s why we strive for an ever better content, marketing and product experience. Also as a pure play streaming business, we’re unencumbered by legacy revenue streams. This freedom means we can offer big movies direct-to-Netflix, without the need for extended or exclusive theatrical windows, and let members binge watch TV if they want, without having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. This focus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believe to be a significant long term business advantage. Our content offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of member tastes by providing an unmatched variety and quality of titles. Our Q2 slate is emblematic of this approach, headlined by season four of Stranger Things, which returned to tremendous fanreception and was a smash hit by all measures - including an outstanding drama Emmy nomination (along withOzarkseason 4 andSquid Game). In its first four weeks,Stranger Thingsseason four generated1.3 billion hours viewed2, making it our biggest season of English TV ever. Season four also re-ignited interest in past episodes with season one through three experiencing a greater than five-fold increase in viewing in the month after the release of season four (vs. the prior month). Season four ofStranger Thingsalso showcased theeffectiveness of our marketing strategy in driving conversation around our titles. When we deliver shows and movies that members are talking about in large numbers, we can influence pop culture, build passion for Netflix and create an experience that is differentiated and difficult-to-replicate. For example, the show catapulted the 1985 songRunning Up That Hillto thetop of the music charts. Metallicaalso enjoyed a return to the charts in the US and UK with their 1986 songMaster of Puppetsafter beingfeatured in the new season ofStranger Things. The cumulative Twitter volume forStranger Thingscontinuesto outpace bothObi-Wan KenobiandTop Gun Maverick, highlighting the big conversation aroundthis title and reinforcing that our binge versus one week at a time release strategy drives lots of “water cooler conversation.” 2Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release for each title; since some titles have multiple premiere dates, whether weekly or in parts, we count the 28 days from each episode premiere date in each country. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 17, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10. 3Source: Twitter. We also delivered a wide variety of other English language series hits in Q2, including season three of The Umbrella Academy(284m view hours*) and seasonone ofThe Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama, which generated 277m hours viewed and has been renewed for a second season. We’ve also renewed the endearing, UK-produced young adult dramaHeartstopper(67m view hours) for another two seasons. In unscripted, audiences embraced season five ofSellingSunset, which recorded 95m view hours in its first four weeks, while the debut season of marriage reality showThe Ultimatumhad 148m view hours. In unscripted, we are also taking global formats and creating local versions. This quarter, we hadRhythm + Flow France, our rap competition show, which wasa big local success. The winner of season one, Fresh, was formerly unknown, working in a gym. But since his appearance on the show, he has become a star with his song CHOP that he performed in the finale hitting #1 on every streaming service in France. He was also invited to the Les Ardentes music festival where he performed for an audience of 15,000 people - another example of \"The Netflix Effect.\" We’re making good progress in film. The basketball dramaHustle(starring Adam Sandler) was our biggest Netflix movie in Q2 (186m hours viewed) and was loved by critics and audiences alike, followed by the comedySenior Year, starring Rebel Wilson,with 161m view hours. We continue to invest in animated features; building off our initial titles likeOver the MoonandBackto the Outback, we releasedThe Sea Beast(102m hoursviewed*) early in Q3 to audience and critical acclaim. Today, we announced that we will be acquiring leading animation studioAnimal Logic, with ~800 amazing people mostly in Sydney and Vancouver, which will help us accelerate the development of our animation production capabilities and reinforces our commitment to build a world-class animation studio. We’ve been partnering with Animal Logic for two years now, working onThe Magician’s Elephant (directed by Wendy Rogers) and the recently announcedThe Shrinking of the Treehorns(directed by Ron Howard). Together, we’ll create an animation studio that will produce some of our largest animated 4feature films. We’ll fund the purchase from our existing cash balance. The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals and we anticipate closing later this year. We’re building on our lead in non-English programming. We want Netflix to be relevant to audiences all over the globe and our local language titles are a differentiator for us. We focus first on telling authentic stories for local impact, but we see that great stories can travel everywhere. Another example of this In Q2 wasThe Marked Heart, a Colombian series, whichfound a global audience and ended up in the top 10 in 81 countries around the world by its second week. Similarly,The Takedown, a French film, wasin the top 10 in 91 countries around the world by its second week, again showing the power of an authentic story and our ability to serve those stories - with subtitling, dubbing, and personalized discovery - for members to enjoy around the world. While we always have room to improve, we’re very pleased with how far we’ve come in providing so much satisfaction and enjoyment to our members. For instance, in the US, which is one of the most competitive markets in the world, we drewmore TVviewing time than any other outletduring the 2021-22 TV season (see chart below), nearly matching the combined total of the two most watched broadcast networks. And, as Nielsen will announce on Thursday, our share of US TV viewing reached an all-time high of 7.7% in June (vs. 6.6% in June 2021), demonstrating our ability to grow our engagement share as we continue to improve our service. Since our launch of a small selection of licensed mobile games last November, we’ve released new games every few weeks, with the portfolio growing to the current total of 24. The games are all intended to be accessible to broad audiences, and span several genres and categories, including racing with Asphalt Xtreme, the digital version of the irreverentcard gameExploding Kittens, zombies inInto the Dead 2and the knitting for cats inKnittens. We’vehad millions of our members play games through the service and we are learning about what games work for different audiences. We’re adapting our 5licensing and partner-based development activities in response to these learnings. We’ve also acquired three games studios (Night School Studios, Boss Fight Studios, and Next Games) which gives us a range of expertise in multiple geographies to accelerate the buildout of our internal development capacity. We are building a solid pipeline of new games that will launch over the next several years and are excited to see our members engage with these titles. Near Term Focus In the near term, a key priority to re-accelerate revenue growth is to evolve and improve our monetization. In the early days of streaming, we kept our pricing very simple with just one plan level. In 2014, we introduced three price tiers to better segment demand. Going forward, we will focus on better monetizing usage through both continued optimization of our pricing and tiering structures as well as the addition of a new, lower-priced ad-supported tier. Advertising Our lower priced advertising-supported offering will complementour existing plans, which will remain ad-free. Our global ARM has grown at a 5% compoundannual rate from 2013 to 2021, so it makes sense now to give consumers a choice for a lower priced option with advertisements, if they desire it. We recentlyannouncedMicrosoft as our technologyand sales partner and we’re targeting to launch this tier around the early part of 2023. They are investing heavily to expand their multi-billion advertising business into premium television video, and we are thrilled to be working with such a strong global partner. We’re excited by the opportunity given the combination of our very engaged audience and high quality content, which we think will attract premium CPMs from brand advertisers. We’ll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant. Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So, our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one. Over time, our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that’s more seamless and relevant for consumers, and more effective for our advertising partners. While it will take some time to grow our member base for the ad tier and the associated ad revenues, over the long run, we think advertising can enable substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth (through ad revenues). Paid Sharing We’re in the early stages of working to monetize the 100m+ households that are currently enjoying, but not directly paying for, Netflix. We know this will be a change for our members. As such, we have launchedtwo different approachesin Latin Americato learn more. Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023. We’re encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America. 6Simplicity At Netflix, focus remains very important to us. These initiatives - paid sharing and advertising - do introduce some additional complexity, but our approach has always been tokeep our business model as simple as possible within the context of our growth objectives. In this vein, these initiatives are similar to expanding into originals, launching our service across the world, and building our own studio, each of which also increased complexity but are natural extensions intended to enhance our existing business. F/X Neutral Operating Margin Disclosure To provide additional transparency around our operating margin, we’ll now disclose our year-to-date (YTD) operating margin based on F/X ratesat the beginningof each year. This will allow investors to see how our operating margin is tracking against our target (which was set in January of 2022 based on F/X rates at that time), absent intra-year fluctuations in F/X (which have beensubstantial in 2022). As can be seen from the table below, F/X-driven changes to our revenue have a high flow through to operating income (the operating profit impact ranges from ~75% to 80%+ of the revenue impact). This is because the bulk of our expenses don’t change with F/X fluctuations.  Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year. YTD 2022 through June 30, 2022. Note: There were no adjustments to content amortization for the purposes of this calculation, as titles are amortized at the historical blended rate at the time of capitalization. 7Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was +$103 million vs. -$64 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)3in the quarter totaled+$13 million, compared with -$175 million in Q2’21. Cash declined $190m sequentially, primarily due to our Next Games acquisition ($69m) and the F/X impact on cash ($145m). As we’ve discussed previously, we are now self-funding. For the full year 2022, we expect FCF to be approximately +$1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars (assuming no material further movements in F/X). We expect annual positive FCF going forward (with substantial growth in FCF in 2023 vs. 2022) due to our increasing revenue, solid profitability, and the successful multi-year evolution of our content model. We’re now more than a decade into transforming our service from licensed second run content to mostly Netflix originals - including more than five years into building out our internal studio to produce the majority of our original titles (60% of our net content assets on our balance sheet are Netflix-produced). We’re now through the most cash-intensive part of that transition. As a result, our cash content spend-to-content amortization expense ratio peaked at 1.6x (along with peak negative FCF of -$3.3B in 2019) and is expected to be about 1.2-1.3x in 2022 and to decline going forward, based on our current plans, which assume no material expansion into new content categories in ‘23. 2022 estimate based on the midpoint of 1.2x-1.3x range. 3For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 8Gross debt at quarter end amounted to $14.3 billion, within our targeted range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $5.8 billion, net debt totaled $8.5 billion, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA4. Our capital structure policy remains unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (eg, about $5.3 billion based on Q2 revenue). After meeting those needs, our intent is to return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) At this year’s annual meeting in June, shareholders approved proposals to declassify our board, remove supermajority voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings. We’ve also changed the voting standard for our directors to simple majority in uncontested elections. Our governance structure is now similar to other large cap company governance structures. With more than one billion people living with some form of disability, we want to ensure Netflix is as accessible as possible. In Q2, we announced that we are expanding the availability of audio descriptions and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing to a total of 20 languages - work that recently won the prestigiousDr. Jacob Bolotin Award. We’ve also introducednew badges for our titles that have audio descriptions and subtitles on laptop and iOS, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first. Summary Reaccelerating our revenue growth is a big challenge. But we’ve been through hard times before. We’ve built this company to be flexible and adaptable and this will be a great test for us and our high performance culture. We’re fortunate to be in a position of strength as the leader in streaming entertainment by all metrics (revenue, engagement, subscribers, profit and free cash flow). We’re confident and optimistic about the future.

       "  \"Summary:  Revenue, operating income and membership slightly exceeded our forecast in Q3’22.  We had big hits across TV and film in Q3 – launching some of our most watched series and films of all time, including:  Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,Stranger ThingsS4,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, The Gray Man, andPurple Hearts  Our lower priced ad-supported plan launches in 12 countries in November – just six months after our initial announcement. Our existing plans remain ad free.  Netflix has higher engagement than any other streamer – with room for growth:  In the UK, Netflix accounts for 8.2% of video viewing, 2.3x Amazon and 2.7x Disney+1;  In the US, Netflix accounts for 7.6% of TV time, 2.6x Amazon and 1.4x Disney + Hulu + Hulu Live2.  Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix's $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit. After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth. The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us. 1Based on reporting fromBARB, as of September 2022 2Based onNielsen’s Gauge, as of August 2022 Q3 Results Our 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 5% increase in average paid memberships and a 1% rise in ARM3. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), revenue and ARM grew 13% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. The sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to F/X. We under-forecasted paid net additions, which totaled 2.4 million vs. our 1.0m forecast and compared to 4.4m in the year ago quarter.  In APAC, revenue grew 19% excluding F/X as average paid memberships rose 23% year-over-year. ARM was -3% year-over-year, excluding F/X, partially driven by lower ARM in India, somewhat offset by higher ARM in Australia and Korea. We added 1.4m paid memberships in the region (vs. 2.2m last Q3).  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM grew 13% and 7%, respectively. Paid net adds totaled 0.6m vs. 1.8m in the year ago quarter.  In LATAM, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, supported by ARM growth of 16% vs. the year ago quarter excluding F/X. We added 0.3m paid memberships, in-line with membership growth in Q3’21.  In UCAN, our most penetrated market, ARM and revenue grew by 12% and 11%, respectively, excluding F/X. Paid net adds totaled 0.1m (similar to the 0.1m in Q3’21). For Q3, operating income totaled $1.5 billion vs. $1.8 billion in Q3’21. Operating income was above our beginning-of-quarter forecast, partially due to higher revenue, as well as a shift in timing of some spend from Q3 to Q4. As a result, operating margin of 19% was above our 16% forecast. The four percentage point year-over-year decline in operating margin is almost entirely due to the appreciation in the US dollar vs. most other currencies during this period. EPS of $3.10 vs. $3.19 a year ago included a $348 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Q4 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. The appreciation of the US dollar remains a significant headwind for us (and US-based multinationals in general). For Q4’22, we’re expecting revenue of $7.8 billion with the sequential decline entirely due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar vs. other currencies. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Our revenue growth forecast is driven by our expectation for 4.5m paid net adds (vs. 8.3m in Q4’21) and ARM growth of 6% year-over-year, excluding F/X. Our paid net adds forecast assumes that we experience our usual seasonality as well as the impact of a strong content slate, counterbalanced by macroeconomic weakness which leads to less-than-normal visibility. While we’re very optimistic about our new advertising business, we don’t expect a material contribution in Q4’22 as we’re launching our Basic with Ads plan intra-quarter and anticipate growing our membership in that plan gradually over time. Our aim 3ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 2is to give our prospective new members more choice - not switch members off their current plans. Members who don’t want to change will remain on their current plan, without ads, at the current price. We forecast Q4’22 operating margin of 4% vs. 8% in the year ago period. The fourth quarter is typically our lowest operating margin quarter of the year as it’s usually our largest quarter in terms of content and marketing spend. In addition, the aforementioned F/X impact has a high flow through to operating income (~75%-80% of the revenue impact) as most of our costs are in US dollars. Excluding the year-over-year impact of F/X, our Q4’22 operating margin forecast would be 10% vs. 8% in Q4’21. TheUS dollar has strengthenedagainst most othercurrencies at a historic rate this year. Based on our YTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negatively impact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. As a reminder, our 2022 and 2023 operating margin target of 19%-20% is based on F/X rates in January 2022, as we discussed in ourQ4’21 letterand subsequentearnings calls. We’re on track to meet this F/X neutral operating margin objective for 2022 (excluding the $150m of restructuring costs in Q2) and for 2023. With the appreciation of the US dollar though, our reported operating margin would be lower than 19%-20% should the US dollar remain above January 2022 levels relative to other currencies. Over the medium term, we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. Our long term goal remains unchanged - to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating profit even faster (as we expand margins) and deliver growing positive free cash flow. Guidance Evolution As discussed in previous letters, we are increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top line metric. This will become particularly important heading into 2023 as we develop new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing, where membership is just one component of our revenue growth. So, 3starting with our Q4’22 letter in January of 2023, we’ll continue to provide guidance for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and fully diluted shares outstanding for the following quarter, but not paid membership. Similar to our regional membership disclosure, we’ll continue to report our global and regional membership each quarter as part of our earnings release. Content & Marketing We started our original programming strategy about a decade ago as we anticipated that some competitors would eventually stop licensing their content to Netflix. It’s been a huge challenge to build a lifetime of entertainment in just ten years in multiple languages and across so many different genres- series, films, animation, stand-up and non-fiction. And while we’ve had our share of misses, we’ve managed to create a very broad slate with many great series and films, for whatever your mood or tastes, from amazing storytellers around the world. Given everything we’ve learned, we’re confident we can deliver even more member value per content investment dollar over time. One of the best ways to understand the success of our content is by understanding our engagement. So we’re excited that BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board), the leading audience measurement and video ratings organization in the UK, is now reporting the share of video viewing for streaming services and broadcast groups in the UK on a monthly basis. In September, Netflix accounted for 8.2% of viewing, and we have more than 2x the monthly engagement of our next closest streaming competitor. This reporting is similar to Nielsen’s Gauge, which launched in May 2021 when Netflix accounted for 6% of viewing compared to 7.6% in August 2022. Our hope is that other measurement companies around the world will join Nielsen and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming and the viewing share of relevant entertainment companies. We think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles. This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love. As theGoogle Trends chartshows, the ability to watch all ofMonster: The Jeffrey DahmerStoryhelped drive significant interest in the show. 4It’s hard to imagine, for example, how a Korean title likeSquid Gamewould have become a mega hit globally without the momentum that came from people being able to binge it. We believe the ability for our members to immerse themselves in a story from start to finish increases their enjoyment but also their likelihood to tell their friends, which then means more people watch, join and stay with Netflix. Our Q3 content slate was especially strong. In English scripted TV, we kicked off the quarter with Stranger ThingsS4, which generated 1.35 billion hoursviewed4- our biggest season of an English language series ever. This was followed in August byThe Sandman(351 million hours viewed), which was loved by fans and critics alike. Near the end of the quarter, we launched season five of fan favoriteCobra Kai(270 million hours viewed) and limited seriesMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story*(824 million hours viewed) from Ryan Murphy, which is now our second largest English series. We continue to see great success with our non-English programming too, withSquid Gamemaking awards history by becoming the first foreign language title to win an Emmy - withsix awards, including for directing, production design and lead actor. Also from Korea,Extraordinary Attorney Woo, a unique series about an autistic lawyer, has reached #1 on our weekly non-English series list in 28 countries, notching up 402 million hours viewed and making it our sixth largest non-English TV show ever through 28 days.Narco-Saintshas been another huge K-Contentwin this quarter, with 128 million hours viewed since launch.Sintoniahas been a big hit for Netflixin Brazil, with season three generating 38 million hours viewed. And while it is still early days for German seriesThe Empress*, it launched with a very strong start (136 million hours viewed). Our goal is to create authentic local stories for members in the home territory, which we also make available globally. Film is incredibly important to our members. We expanded into original film in 2016 because producing our own movies across all budgets and genres has advantages over the next best alternative: only licensing from other studios in the first pay TV window (the “pay-one” window). Those advantages include first window availability on Netflix (pay-one movies debut generally well after theatrical release), global rights (pay-one movies are licensed by country), the ability to carry the films on Netflix in perpetuity (typically only for 18-24 months for pay-one films) and copyright ownership, enabling us to create derivatives like sequels and to use the intellectual property (IP) in games and consumer products. We continue to complement our original films with 3rd party licensed films - they remain an important and valued part of our service, but they are just one component of our broader programming strategy. We’re pleased with the progress of our original film initiative. The big budget action filmThe Gray Man (254 million hours viewed) reflects the scope of our ambition to create theatrical quality blockbusters that can reach huge audiences on Netflix: 118 million households (many of which are multi person) if you divide the total hours viewed by the film’s run time of 2 hours and 9 minutes. But since we’re not limited by the need to optimize for theatrical attendance, we can also produce a wider variety of films that consumers can enjoy. For example, the romantic dramaPurple Heartswas a hit among our members with 229 million hours viewed. We’re at an even earlier stage with animated feature films but in early Q3 we releasedThe Sea Beast(165 millionhours viewed), which is our biggest original animated 4Hours viewed data is based on viewing in the first 28 days of release for each episode. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through October 16, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed atNetflix Top 10, whereyou can also find our detailed methodology. 5film to date. On the non-English language film side,Darlings(33 million hours viewed), starring Alia Bhatt, launched to rave reviews and huge fandom in India.Loving Adults(67 million hours viewed), a psychological thriller from Denmark, andCarter(65million hours viewed), a Korean blockbuster, were our two biggest non-English films of the quarter and are now our seventh and ninth most popular non-English films ever. We also continue to invest heavily in marketing, with a particular focus on innovative ways to drive conversation around our titles, which in turn boosts engagement for Netflix. For example, our campaigns for Stranger ThingsS4 andThe Gray Mandrove more than9.8 billion and 1.2 billion impressions, respectively, across paid marketing, social media platforms and events. And content forTudum, our global fan eventthat ran for its second year in September, generated almost1 billion views- up over 30% from last year. Beyond TV and movies, we’re coming up on the one year anniversary of our gaming launch. As we’ve said, this will be a multi-year journey for us to learn how to please game players. Our first year was about establishing our gaming infrastructure and understanding how our members interact with games. We now have 35 games on service (all included in every Netflix subscription without in-game ads or in-app purchases) and we’re seeing some encouraging signs of gameplay leading to higher retention. With 55 more games in development, including more games based on Netflix IP, we’re focused in the next few years on creating hit games that will take our game initiative to the next level. More generally, we see a big opportunity around content that crosses between TV or film and games. For example, after the launch of the animeCyberpunk: Edgerunners(49million hours viewed) in Q3use of CD Projekt’s game surgedon PCs. Product and Pricing As we’ve been discussing over the past few quarters, improving our pricing strategy is an important near-term focus. Last week, weannouncedthat we’llbe launching an ad-supported subscription plan on November 1 in Canada and Mexico; November 3 in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the US; and November 10 in Spain. Cumulatively, these 12 markets account for ~$140 billion of brand advertising spend across TV and streaming, or over 75% of the global market5. To start, we’re keeping it simple by offering one low-priced ad plan – Basic with Ads – at a price that’s 20%-40% below our current starting price. So in the US, for example, Netflix will now start at $6.99 per month (compared to $9.99 today). The Basic with Ads plan will have ~5 minutes of advertising per hour, frequency capping and strong privacy protections. The reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice, especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue and operating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue. Finally, we’ve landed on a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing and we’ll begin rolling this out more broadly starting in early 2023. After listening to consumer feedback, we are going to offer the 5Excluding China and Russia, where we don’t operate. 6ability for borrowers to transfer their Netflix profile into their own account, and for sharers to manage their devices more easily and to create sub-accounts (“extra member”), if they want to pay for family or friends. In countries with our lower-priced ad-supported plan, we expect the profile transfer option for borrowers to be especially popular. Competition As we’ve long said, we operate in a highly competitive industry, where people have many different entertainment choices – from linear TV to streaming, YouTube to TikTok and gaming to social media. The silver lining is that the opportunity is very large and growing, and Netflix is still very small relative to that opportunity (for example, ~8% of total TV time in the US and the UK, two of our most established countries). In the 190 countries in which we operate, our $30 billion-plus of annual revenue is roughly 5% of the combined estimated ~$300 billion pay TV/streaming industry, ~$180 billion branded advertising market, and $130 billion consumers spend annually on gaming6. So, we believe that we have a long runway for growth if we can continue to improve our offering steadily over time. As it’s become clear that streaming is the future of entertainment, our competitors – including media companies and tech players – are investing billions of dollars to scale their new services. But it's hard to build a large and profitable streaming business – our best estimate is that all of these competitors are losing money on streaming, with aggregate annual direct operating losses this year alone that could be well in excess of $10 billion, compared with our +$5-$6 billion of annual operating profit. For incumbent entertainment companies, this high level of investment is understandable given the accelerating decline of linear TV, which currently generates the bulk of their profit. Ultimately though, we believe some of our competitors will seek to build sustainable, profitable businesses in streaming - either on their own or through continued industry consolidation. While it’s early days, we’re starting to see this increased profit focus - with some raising prices for their streaming services, some reigning in content spending, and some retrenching around traditional operating models which may dilute their direct-to-consumer offering. Amidst this formidable, diverse set of competitors, we believe our focus as a pure-play streaming business is an advantage. Our aim remains to be the first choice in entertainment, and to continue to build an amazingly successful and profitable business. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $557 million vs. $82 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF)7amounted to $472 million,compared with -$106 million in Q3’21. We continue to expect FCF of +$1 billion for the full year 2022, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars and substantial growth in FCF in 2023 (assuming no further material appreciation of the US dollar) . Gross debt at quarter end was $14 billion, within our $10-$15 billion target range. Cash increased $300 million sequentially to $6.1 billion. Net debt amounted to $7.9 billion at the end of Q3’22, or 1.2x LTM 6Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimatesand excludes China and Russia.

We have no debt maturities in 2023. In early October, we closed our previously announced acquisition of leading animation studio Animal Logic. We funded the transaction with cash, which will be reflected in our Q4’22 cash flow statement. There’s no change to our capital allocation approach. Our first priority is to continue to invest appropriately in our business for the long term, including new initiatives such as games and advertising, followed by selective acquisitions. After that, excess cash above our minimum cash levels (equivalent to roughly two months of revenue) will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.

Ted said: “I want to thank Reed for his visionary leadership, mentorship and friendship over the last 20 years. We’ve all learned so much from his intellectual rigor, honesty and willingness to take big bets – and we look forward to working with him for many more years to come. Since Reed started to delegate management to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values and like-minded approach to growth.

Ted and I have worked together for many years – building tremendous trust and respect for each other. We\\'re also motivated by the same goal: a desire to better serve our members so that we can continue to grow our business.” In addition to these changes, Bela Bajaria, formerly Head of Global TV, has become Chief Content Officer and Scott Stuber has become Chairman of Netflix Film. Ted said: “Bela and Scott are outstanding creative executives with proven track records at Netflix. In 2022 we premiered many of our most popular series and films in Netflix history, including Wednesday, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Purple Hearts, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, The Adam Project and Harry & Meghan – a testament to their leadership and creativity.

Q4 Results Year over year revenue growth of 2% in Q4 (10% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis2) was driven by a 4% increase in average paid memberships. ARM3declined 2% year over year, but grew 5% on a F/X neutral basis2. Revenue was slightly above our beginning-of-quarterprojection, as paid net adds of 7.7M (vs. 8.3M in Q4’21) came in higher than our 4.5M forecast, due to both strong acquisition and retention, driven primarily by the success of our Q4 content slate. In addition, the US dollar depreciated vs. most other currencies during the quarter, which resulted in slightly higher than projected ARM. Operating income of $550M in Q4 was down vs. $632M in Q4 ‘21. This was above our guidance forecast of $330M primarily due to higher than expected revenue as well as slower-than-forecasted hiring. Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 7% compared to 8% in Q4’21. This year over year decline was due to the appreciation of the US dollar. For the full year 2022, our operating margin amounted to 18% vs. 2Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchangerate movements. Assumes foreign exchange rates remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. 3ARM(Average Revenue per Membership) is defined asstreaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 221% in FY21. Based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022 and excluding the $150M in restructuring charges in Q2’22, this translates into an operating margin of 20%, at the high end of the 19%-20% target we set inJanuary of 2022. F/X Neutral Operating Margin (Excluding Restructuring Charges in Q2 2022)  Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year (and excluding the $150M of restructuring costs in Q2 2022). Note: Excludes F/X impact on content amortization, as titles are amortized at a historical blended rate based on timing of spend. EPS in Q4’22 was $0.12 vs. $1.33 in Q4‘21. This was below our $0.36 forecast due to a $462M non-cash unrealized loss from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt as a result of the depreciation of the US dollar vs. the Euro during Q4’22. As a reminder, our approximately $5B of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge on the relative value of the Euro for net income. However, it doesn’t affect operating income as unrealized gains or losses are recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” For the full year, we recognized a non-cash unrealized gain of $353M from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro bonds. Forecast As we noted in our Q3’22 shareholder letter, revenue is our primary top line metric, particularly as we develop additional revenue streams where membership is just one component of our growth (like advertising and paid sharing). The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the rollout of major new initiatives (paid sharing and ads) plus current uncertain macroeconomic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. We forecast Q1’23 revenue growth of 4% (8% on a F/X neutral basis). We expect our F/X neutral revenue growth to be driven by a combination of year over year growth in average paid memberships and ARM. This translates into modest positive paid net adds in Q1 ‘23 (vs. paid net adds of -0.2M in Q1’22). Our 3expectation of fewer paid net adds in Q1’23 vs. Q4’22 is consistent with normal seasonality and factors in our strong member growth in Q4’22, which likely pulled forward some growth from Q1’23. In addition, we expect to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1’23 (more details below in the Product and Pricing section). We anticipate that this will result in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2’23 than in Q1’23. From our experience in Latin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing, which impacts near term member growth. But as borrower households begin to activate their own standalone accounts and extra member accounts are added, we expect to see improved overall revenue, which is our goal with all plan and pricing changes. Our long term financial objectives remain unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expand operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. For the full year 2023, as we continue to improve our service, grow our advertising business and launch paid sharing, we expect constant currency revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. We also expect year over year operating profit growth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F/X). We have been targeting a FY23 operating margin of 19%-20% based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022. We now expect to deliver roughly 21%-22% operating margin on this basis (above the 19%-20% range). Rolling forward to F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, this translates into a FY23 operating margin target of 18%-20%. For Q1’23, we expect operating margin to be down year over year (20% vs. 25%) due primarily to the timing of content spend. Content and Marketing People have more choice of films and TV shows than ever so we need to ensure that there’s always something great for them to watch on Netflix, regardless of their taste, mood, or who they’re watching with. It’s why we’re so focused on continuing to improve our content and broaden our slate. 2022\\'s successful slate was the result of having the best creative executives working with best in class creators. Last year alone we launched4:  Five of our Top 10 most popular English language TV seasons ever –Stranger Things 4and Wednesday(both of which hit 1B hours viewed), Monster:The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,Bridgerton S2 andInventing Anna– as well asHarry & Meghan,our second most successful doc series ever;  Four of our Top 10 most popular English language films ever–The Adam Project, The Gray Man, Purple HeartsandGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery– as well asThe Sea BeastandThe Tinder Swindler, our most successful animated and documentaryfilms respectively;  Seven of our Top 10 most popular non-English films ever –Troll(Norway),All Quiet on the Western Front(Germany),Black Crab(Sweden),ThroughMy Window(Spain),The Takedown (France),My Name is Vendetta(Italy), andLovingAdults(Denmark);  Two of our Top 10 most popular non-English TV shows ever–All of Us Are Deadand Extraordinary Attorney Woo, both from Korea. 4For View Hours for these titles, please visitNetflixTop 10. 4We’re also pleased with the progress we’ve made with returning titles. Members watched more Netflix returning seasons and sequels in 2022 than ever before across a broad range of genres – from film (Enola Holmes2,Lost Bullet2 and two365 Dayssequels) and unscripted (Selling SunsetS5 andLove is BlindS3) to award winning drama (OzarkS4 andThe CrownS5),local language series (SintoniaS3,Young RoyalsS2 andAlice in BorderlandS2, whose success pushed S1back into the Top 10 after its launch) and animation (Big MouthS6). It’s hard to think of two titles that more successfully pierced the zeitgeist this year thanStranger Things4 andWednesday. Both pushed old songs into the musiccharts: Kate Bush’sRunning Up That Hillwent to number 1 on Billboard’s Global charts for the first time, 37 years after it was first released, and Lady Gaga’sBloody Marymade it onto the Billboard top40 list for the first time ever, 11 years after it was first released. We get amazing results when we have aWednesday,Glass OnionorMonstermoment with our members. We believe people typically sign up for a streaming service because they’ve heard about a title “you simply must watch” from a friend, seen the excitement on social media or read about it in the press. Generating conversation is our primary marketing goal because we see that it drives acquisition and encourages existing members to watch more, which in turn helps with retention. For Ryan Murphy’s The Watcher, conversation about the series led tofans flocking to the house, aSaturday Night Livespoof and a spike inhome security sales. OurWednesdaycampaign, with all our marketing in Wednesday’s iconic voice, generated 1.5B organic social impressionspre-launch, a record for a Netflix season one. Over time, we hope to have more and more of these moments across film and TV, and to replicate these successes on the games side. It’s now slightly over a year since we launched games on the Netflix service. We’ve madegood progress in that time - creating the infrastructure to deliver games to mobile devices, building a portfolio of 50 games across many genres and acquiring four game studios to bolster our internal production capabilities. In Q4, we launched season four of unscripted seriesToo Hot to Handle,which was a top 10 title for us globally for three consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, we debuted ourToo Hot to Handle game, which has been our biggest game launch to date and is another encouraging sign in the long term opportunity to entertain members with Netflix intellectual property (IP) across different mediums. In 2023, we’ll continue toexpand our offeringwith moregames, with a focus on Netflix-related IP. Product and Pricing As discussed over the past few quarters, we’re working to give people more choice when it comes to price as well as greater control over their Netflix account. In November, we successfully launched our new, lower priced ad-supported plan in 12 countries. We believe branded television advertising is a substantial long term incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Netflix, and our ability to stand up this business in six months underscores our commitment both to give members more choice and to reaccelerate our growth. While it’s still early days for ads and we have lots to do (in particular better targeting and measurement), we are pleased with our progress to date across every dimension: member experience, value to advertisers, and incremental contribution to our business. Engagement, which is consistent with members on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected and we believe the lower 5price point is driving incremental membership growth. Also, as expected, we’ve seen very little switching from other plans. Overall the reaction to this launch from both consumers and advertisers has confirmed our belief that our ad-supported plan has strong unit economics (at minimum, in-line with or better than the comparable ad-free plan) and will generate incremental revenue and profit, though the impact on 2023 will be modest given that this will build slowly over time. Later in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business. While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change for members who share their account more broadly. So we’ve worked hard to build additional new features that improve the Netflix experience, including the ability for members to review which devices are using their account and to transfer a profile to a new account. As we roll out paid sharing, members in many countries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t live with. As is the case today,allmembers will be ableto watch while traveling, whether on a TV or mobile device. As we work through this transition – and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don’t convert to extra members or full paying accounts – near term engagement, as measured by third parties like Nielsen’s The Gauge, could be negatively impacted. However, we believe the pattern will be similar to what we’ve seen in Latin America, with engagement growing over time as we continue to deliver a great slate of programming and borrowers sign-up for their own accounts. Competition We continue to operate in a highly competitive market as consumers have a vast number of entertainment choices. Beyond our direct streaming competitors, we also vie for consumers’ time against linear TV, YouTube, short form entertainment like TikTok, and gaming, to name just a few. The silver lining is that the market for entertainment is huge and Netflix is still very small by comparison. For example, in the more than 190 countries we operate in, our $30B+ of annual revenue compares against the combined annual estimated ~$300B pay TV/streaming industry, $180B branded TV advertising spend and $130 billion consumer spend on gaming5. It’s not easy to build a large and profitable streaming business. But we’re competing from a position of strength, as we lead the industry in terms of engagement, revenue and streaming profit. As a pure-play streaming company, we’re also not anchored to shrinking legacy business models, like traditional entertainment firms, allowing us to lean hard into the big growth opportunity ahead of us. As we’ve said before, beyond revenue and profitability, another way to look at our business is through engagement, and we are pleased to have Kantar join Nielsen – who have expanded their efforts – and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming as well as the viewing share of different entertainment companies in Brazil, Mexico, and Poland. 5Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludes hardware sales. 6As can be seen in the newly reported markets of Mexico, Brazil, and Poland, we are less than 5% of TV viewing. And in our largest markets like the US and the UK, we are still less than 10% of TV screen time. As one of the leaders in streaming across all markets, we’re encouraged by the fact that streaming overall accounts for less than 40% of viewing across these markets (and as little as 6% in Poland). We believe ultimately the vast majority of time spent on TV will happen via streaming, which should provide a long runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. tablet and laptop), all others are TV only. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities was $0.4B in Q4’22 (vs. -$0.4B in the prior year period) and $2.0B for FY22 (vs. $0.4B in FY21). Free cash flow (FCF)6for Q4 totaled $0.3B, compared with -$0.6Bin the year ago quarter. For FY22, we generated FCF of $1.6B (vs. -$0.2B in FY21), above our forecast of approximately $1B. Now that we are a decade into our original programming initiative and have successfully scaled it, we are past the most cash intensive phase of this buildout. As a result, we believe we will now be generating sustained, positive annual free cash flow going forward. Assuming no material swings in F/X, we expect at least $3B of FCF for the full year 2023. We closed two previously announced acquisitions in Q4 - leading animation studioAnimal Logicand games studioSpry Fox. We funded these purchases fromcash on hand. 6Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activitiesless purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. 7Gross debt at quarter end totaled $14B, in-line with our targeted range of $10-$15B. With cash and short term investments of $6B, net debt totaled $8B, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA.7We don’t have any scheduled debt maturities in FY23 and only $400M of debt maturities in FY24. All of our debt is fixed rate. Our capital structure policy is unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (e.g., about $5.2B based on Q4 revenue). After meeting those needs, we intend to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Assuming no material acquisitions, we anticipate resuming our share buyback program in 2023. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Two years ago we increased our focus on sustainability and related initiatives8– building a team of experts, announcing an ambitious environmentalcommitment,and exploring creative-friendly ways to reduce emissions in our productions (which account for more than half of our emissions as a company). As a result,Netflix production sets are becomingmore sustainablethrough cleaner technologies, including electric vehicles and clean alternatives to diesel generators. In 2021, we created theNetflix Fund for CreativeEquity, committing $100M over five years to further develop our pipeline for underrepresented talent. Through the fund, Netflix supports external organizations committed to creating equitable opportunities in the TV and film industries, as well as bespoke Netflix programsthat help us to identify,train and provide job placement for emerging talent globally. To date we\\'ve committed $29M towards these initiatives, supporting over 1,000 up-and-coming creatives and more than 35 programs around the world.
