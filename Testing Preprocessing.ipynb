Combined with a 9% increase in  ASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5%  margin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating  margin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year.   EPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items  that affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X  remeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which  partially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed  repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform.   In Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last  year’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than  expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet  entertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based.  In the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3  million. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although  contribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the  marketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter.   Internationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record  for quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue  and ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments  in a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017  (4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution  profit in our history.   We took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward  with. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected  expense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger  than expected member growth and the timing of international content spend.  Forecast  The guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net  adds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally.  As we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year  2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year.   We believe our big investments in content are paying off.  In 2017, average streaming hours per  membership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more  revenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018.   2  Big hits like \\u200b13 Reasons Why\\u200b, \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b and \\u200bBright \\u200bresult from a combination of great content and  great marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about  $1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content,  and we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll  grow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018.   Content  Q4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b and \\u200bBlack  Mirror\\u200b as well as \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon\\u200b.\\u200b In the quarter, we  also successfully launched new titles like the limited series \\u200bGodless\\u200b, \\u200bMarvel’s The Punisher\\u200b and  Mindhunter\\u200b (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s  amazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had \\u200bthree of the Top  5\\u200b most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row.   Our largest investment in original films to date, \\u200bBright, \\u200ba fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a  major success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, \\u200bBright\\u200b has become one of our  most viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well  as additional investment in original films.   We’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of \\u200bClub de  Cuervos \\u200bas well as \\u200bThe Day I Met El Chapo,\\u200b both of which are from Mexico; \\u200bSuburra\\u200b from Italy; and an  unscripted series from the UK, \\u200bJack Whitehall: Travels with My Father\\u200b. We also debuted \\u200bDark\\u200b, our first  German original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for  instance, \\u200bDark\\u200b, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions  of members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with  attractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this  initiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland,  India, Korea and Japan.   We are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall  deals with \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b producer Shawn Levy and \\u200bOrange is the New Black\\u200b and \\u200bGLOW\\u200b creator Jenji  Kohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over  the world.  Product and Partnerships  We are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our  mutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix,  while our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of  these types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche  Telekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC  removed the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net  3  neutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the  FCC’s action.   Competition  We have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend  becomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On  the commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large  content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with  Apple Music or with iOS.   Facebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their  multi-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for  entertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix.   Traditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring  most of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand  and great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful  services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content  offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower  end of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of  content payments, which will now occur in 2018.   Our operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is  content. When we develop a title like \\u200bBright\\u200b, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated  membership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for  self-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect  that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend  will turn our business FCF positive.   In the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re  growing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had  planned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018.  Given our track record of content  investments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the  increased investments we are making in original content this year.   We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of  interest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to  grow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt.  High yield has rarely seen  an equity cushion so thick.  4  Board of Directors  We are pleased to add \\u200bRodolphe Belmer\\u200b to our board of directors. Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+  Group in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing  percentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our  board.   Summary  Our goal is to entertain people. We are thrilled to be able to do that at great scale.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q1-18-Shareholder-Letter': \"Fellow shareholders,    We strive to entertain and to bring joy to people across the world through amazing stories. Our 125  million members provided us with $3.6 billion in streaming revenue in Q1. Our job is to spend this  money wisely to increase our members’ delight.           1  Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast   Revenue grew 43% year over year in Q1, the fastest pace in the history of our streaming business, due to  a 25% increase in average paid streaming memberships and a 14% rise in ASP. Operating margin of 12%  rose 232 bps year over year. This was higher than our beginning of quarter guidance, due primarily to  the timing of content spend. Diluted EPS of $0.64 vs. $0.40 included a $41m non-cash unrealized loss  from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond.  Global net adds totaled a new Q1-record of 7.41m, up 50% year over year and ahead of our 6.35m  forecast. The variance relative to our guidance was driven by continued strong acquisition trends across  the globe which we attribute to the growing breadth of our content and the worldwide adoption of  internet entertainment.  In the US, we added 1.96m memberships (compared with forecast of 1.45m). We completed our price  adjustment during this past quarter, resulting in 12% ASP growth for the domestic segment. Outside of  the US, membership grew by 5.46m (vs. forecast of 4.90m). Our international segment now accounts for  50% of revenue and 55% of memberships. Excluding a F/X impact of +$114 million, international  revenue and ASP rose 59% and 13% year over year, respectively.   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2,  we expect 6.2 million global net additions (1.2m in the US and 5.0m for the international segment) vs.  5.2 million in the year ago quarter. Q2 operating margin is expected to be 12%. We are now targeting a  full year operating margin of 10%-11%. We continue to anticipate content and marketing spend to be  weighted towards the second half of 2018.   Content  We’ll have $7.5-$8 billion of content expense (on a P&L basis) in 2018 across a wide variety of formats  (series, films, unscripted, docs, comedy specials, non-English language) to serve the diverse tastes of our  growing global membership base.   Q1 scripted original series debuts included the dark, coming of age story \\u200bThe End of the F***ing World  and sci-fi thriller \\u200bAltered Carbon\\u200b as well as returning seasons of \\u200bMarvel’s Jessica Jones\\u200b, \\u200bGrace\\u200b \\u200band  Frankie, Santa Clarita Diet \\u200band\\u200b A Series of Unfortunate Events\\u200b.   Last year, we expanded our efforts in original programming to unscripted shows across several genres.  Our output in this area is now comparable to similarly-focused US domestic cable networks. Shows like  Queer Eye\\u200b and \\u200bNailed It\\u200b are great examples of our ambitions in this area: engaging, buzz-worthy shows  that drive lots of enjoyment around the world.  Our investment in international production continued to increase with big, non-English originals like \\u200bO  Mecanismo (The Mechanism)\\u200b. Loosely inspired by real events and from \\u200bNarcos\\u200b creator José Padilha, this  drama is tracking to be one of our most viewed originals in Brazil. We are also seeing more examples of  non-English content transcending borders. This quarter, \\u200bLa Casa de Papel\\u200b (\\u200bMoney Heist\\u200b in English  2  language territories), a Spanish language heist thriller, became the most watched non-English series on  Netflix ever.   On Super Bowl Sunday, we surprise-announced and launched \\u200bThe Cloverfield Paradox\\u200b, the third film in  the \\u200bCloverfield\\u200b franchise. Through tight coordination among our original film, product, marketing and PR  teams, the event showcased how a big branded film can be marketed and delivered to consumers  instantaneously across the globe without a wait for the theatrical window. Outside of North America, we  premiered the Alex Garland-directed \\u200bAnnihilation\\u200b, starring Natalie Portman, just weeks after its US  theatrical debut and it has enjoyed large audiences in nearly every country for us. We also released a  broad range of original films: from \\u200bBenji\\u200b for kids and families; to the Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg  produced comedy \\u200bGame Over, Man\\u200b; to the Sundance hip-hop biopic \\u200bRoxanne, Roxanne\\u200b.  We regret our films not being able to compete at this year’s Cannes film festival. The festival adopted a  new rule that means if a film is in competition at Cannes, it can not be watched on Netflix in France for  the following three years . We would never want to do that to our French members. We will continue to  1 celebrate our films and filmmakers at other festivals around the world but unfortunately we will have to  sit out Cannes for now so that our growing French membership can continue to enjoy our original films.   This past quarter, we signed an overall deal with Ryan Murphy, the prolific hit-maker behind \\u200bAmerican  Crime Story: The People vs. OJ Simpson\\u200b, \\u200bNip/Tuck\\u200b, \\u200bGlee\\u200b, \\u200bAmerican Horror Story \\u200band many others. This  comes on the heels of similar partnerships with Shonda Rhimes, Shawn Levy and Jenji Kohan. While  these overall deals are a substantial investment for us, they allow us to work directly with prolific and  talented creators with a proven track record of success. Instead of having to license their shows for a  finite period from outside suppliers, we will own the projects we produce with them. This approach also  allows us to reduce our reliance on third-party studios and forego the corresponding license premiums  we’ve historically paid.   We were proud to celebrate our first feature Academy Award with Bryan Fogel and Dan Cogan, makers  of our documentary \\u200bIcarus. \\u200b We’re thrilled when the creators with whom we partner are recognized for  their exceptional work. The Oscar win helps to reinforce that Netflix is a great home for both  documentary lovers and creators.   Marketing  We’re investing in more marketing of new original titles to create more density of viewing and  conversation around each title (i.e bigger hit in a nation or demographic). We believe this density of  viewing helps on both retention and acquisition, because it makes our original titles even less  substitutable. Because we operate in so many countries, we are able to try different approaches in  different markets, and continue to learn.     1 \\u200bSpecifically, the Cannes festival’s new rule is that a French theatrical opening is required of films in competition, and French  law in essence requires that if a film is in French theatres, then it cannot be on an SVOD service in France for 36 months. While  in other countries we can offer simultaneous exhibition in theatres and on Netflix, that is not permitted in France, so we have  to be Netflix-only for our films in France.   3  Product and Partnerships  Last year, we launched bundle offers with Proximus (in Belgium), SFR Altice (France) and T-Mobile (US).  They have proven to be very successful and we are now adding similar bundle offers with additional  MVPD partners. Recently, we announced that we are bundling the Netflix service with packages from  Sky which will begin later this year and with Comcast in the US, which are currently being rolled out.  These relationships allow our partners to attract more customers and to upsell existing subscribers to  higher ARPU packages, while we benefit from more reach, awareness and often, less friction in the  signup and payment process. We believe that the lower churn in these bundles offsets the lower Netflix  ASP. We remain primarily a direct-to-consumer business, but we see our bundling initiative as an  attractive supplemental channel.   In March, we rolled out additional \\u200bfeatures\\u200b providing members with greater information and control  over their Netflix viewing. While we had already offered PIN protection for all content at a certain  maturity level, there is now a parental PIN control for individual movies and shows. These new features  are part of our ongoing effort to give our members tools to manage how they and their families enjoy  Netflix.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow in Q1 was -$287 million (less negative than we expected due to content payment timing  differences), compared with -$524 million in Q4’17. We continue to forecast free cash flow of -$3 to -$4  billion in 2018, and to be free cash flow negative for several more years as our original content spend  rapidly grows.   We have about $2.6 billion in cash and we will continue to raise debt as needed to fund our increase in  original content. Our debt levels are quite modest as a percentage of our enterprise value, and we  believe the debt is lower cost of capital compared to equity.   Board of Directors  We’re pleased to add \\u200bAmbassador Susan Rice\\u200b to our board of directors. Susan is a former National  Security Advisor and United States Ambassador to the United Nations. As a global company operating in  over 190 countries, Susan’s expertise in international affairs will be valuable.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding content and marketing spend and strategy, including  outside the US; content performance; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total and  paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic  international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income,  earnings per share and free cash flow.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  5  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 5, 2018. The Company provides internal  forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast  numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as  amended by Form 10-K/A.

       " 'FINAL-Q1-19-Shareholder-Letter': \"Fellow shareholders,  Revenue surpassed $4.5 billion in Q1 and we recorded the highest quarterly paid net adds in our history  (9.6m, up 16% year over year). For 20 years, we’ve had the same strategy: when we please our  members, they watch more and we grow more.     Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast  In Q1’19, average streaming paid memberships increased 26% year over year, while ARPU decreased 2%  year over year due to currency headwinds. Excluding F/X, global streaming ARPU improved 3% year over  year and 2% sequentially. Year over year total revenue growth of 22% compares against 40% in Q1’18,  which benefited from several price changes that took place in Q4’17 as well as F/X. On a F/X-neutral  basis, Q1’19 revenue grew 28% year over year.   Operating margin of 10.2% exceeded our beginning-of-quarter expectation as some spending was  shifted from Q1 to later in the year. EPS of $0.76, vs. $0.64 in the prior year period, included a $58  million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming  content obligations dipped sequentially in Q1 due in part to the timing of run-of-series commitments. In  addition, as we shift to more original content, there will be greater variability in content obligations  1  quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of when productions start. We early-adopted the new content  accounting standard (ASU 2019-2) in Q1’19. There is no material impact as our content accounting  policies are already consistent with the new rules.   Paid net adds in Q1 were 9.6 million (with 1.74m in the US and 7.86m internationally), up 16% year over  year, representing a new quarterly record. As always, our quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at  the time we report. For Q2’19, we project total paid net adds of 5.0m (-8% year over year), with 0.3m in  the US and 4.7m for the international segment. This would put us at 14.6m paid net adds for the first  half of 2019, up 7% year over year.     We’re working our way through a series of price increases in the US, Brazil, Mexico and parts of Europe.  The response in the US so far is as we expected and is tracking similarly to what we saw in Canada  following our Q4’18 increase, where our gross additions are unaffected, and we see some modest  short-term churn effect as members consent to the price change. We’re looking forward to a strong  slate of global content in the second half of the year, including new seasons of some of our biggest  series, \\u200bStranger Things \\u200b(July 4th), \\u200b13 Reasons Why, Orange is the New Black\\u200b, \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b and \\u200bLa\\u200b \\u200bCasa de  Papel (\\u200baka\\u200b Money Heist)\\u200b as well as big films like Michael Bay’s \\u200bSix Underground\\u200b and Martin Scorsese’s  The Irishman\\u200b, and expect another year of record annual paid net adds in 2019.  We forecast an acceleration in both streaming ARPU (+2% vs. -2%) and total revenue growth (26% vs.  22%) in Q2 vs. Q1. Excluding currency, we forecast streaming ARPU and total revenue would rise 7% and  32%, respectively in Q2. While there will be some quarter-to-quarter lumpiness in operating margins  due to the timing of spending, our full year 2019 operating margin target of 13% is unchanged, which  means that we expect operating margin in the second half of the year will be higher than the first half.   2  As a result of US tax reform, we took the opportunity to simplify our corporate structure. This will result  in a higher effective tax rate in 2019, including an expected effective tax rate of 48% in Q2’19 due to one  time discrete events. Longer term, we expect our effective tax rate to trend down toward U.S. federal  rates.  Content  We program Netflix with a wide breadth of content to satisfy the diverse tastes of our nearly 150m paid  members and the hundreds of millions of people we hope will one day join Netflix. We continue to see  big successes across our programming categories. For Q1’19, in scripted English language TV, we  premiered another big hit in \\u200bUmbrella Academy\\u200b, based on the comic book by Gerard Way and Gabriel  Bá, which has been watched by 45 million member households in its first four weeks on service.   Our original films effort built on the momentum from our Q4 blockbuster \\u200bBird Box\\u200b with \\u200bTriple Frontier\\u200b,  starring Ben Affleck and directed by J.C. Chandor. This action/heist movie has been watched by over 52  million member households in its first four weeks on Netflix. \\u200bThe Highwaymen \\u200b(starring Kevin Costner  and Woody Harrelson as two lawmen that bring Bonnie and Clyde to justice) is on track to being  watched by over 40 million member households in its first month.   Our documentary feature \\u200bFYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened\\u200b has been watched by over 20  million member households in its first month on Netflix. In early April, we unveiled \\u200bOur Planet\\u200b, our most  ambitious entry into the popular nature documentary genre. More than four years in the making and  shot in 50 different countries, \\u200bOur Planet\\u200b is off to a strong start and is tracking to be one of our most  successful global documentary series launches yet, with over 25 million member households projected  to watch in the first month of release.  We launched our originals effort for the unscripted genre two years ago with several successful  English-language formats like the light hearted cooking competition \\u200bNailed It!\\u200b. We’re building on that  success by launching locally adapted versions in Mexico, France, Germany and Spain. \\u200b¡Nailed It!: México  was the first and launched on February 8, achieving three times more first-month watchers in Mexico  than the dubbed US version.   Our non-English language originals continue to be successful for us and we recently announced that Bela  Bajaria, who has overseen some of our most successful scripted and unscripted titles, will now lead this  programming category for original series in LatAm, EMEA and India. We premiered our first large scale  Korean original series, \\u200bKingdom\\u200b, in January. This period piece with zombies is our most successful season  one show in Korea to date and has also been watched by millions of members outside of Korea with  particularly strong viewing throughout Asia. \\u200bDurante la Tormenta\\u200b (aka \\u200bMirage)\\u200b is a successful  Spanish-language original film that debuted in the quarter and has seen broad viewing across the world.  We’re thrilled for the creators of our content when they are recognized for their exceptional work.  We’re proud that last year Netflix became the most nominated network at the Emmys and now has tied  to become the #2 most nominated studio at the Oscars; we tied for most wins in both, including major  3  Oscar wins for Alfonso Cuarón for Best Director and Best Cinematographer for \\u200bRoma\\u200b, which also won for  Best Foreign Language Feature.   Marketing  Our CMO, Kelly Bennett, will be retiring this year after an amazing seven year run. During this time, Kelly  was a key contributor to the transformation of Netflix from a primarily domestic service with only 2nd  run content to a global service launching an unprecedented amount of original programming and we  thank Kelly for his hard work. Ted Sarandos has led content for nearly 20 years here, and is ready to run  both content and marketing, so he is leading the search for the new CMO, who will report to him.   Product and Partnerships  We’ve been expanding our bundling initiative and we are now distributing Netflix through ten different  operator bundles across the globe. To date, these bundles have had a positive effect on our business,  driving incremental acquisition at similar economics to other partnerships where Netflix is offered ȧ la  carte.   Later in Q2 we’ll be running a test to improve our UK member experience by releasing weekly top 10  lists of the most popular content on our UK service across various programming categories.  For those  who want to watch what others are watching, this may make choosing titles even easier.  After a few  months we’ll decide whether to end or expand the test.  Competition  Recently, Apple and Disney each unveiled their direct-to-consumer subscription video services. Both  companies are world class consumer brands and we’re excited to compete; the clear beneficiaries will  be content creators and consumers who will reap the rewards of many companies vying to provide a  great video experience for audiences.   We don’t anticipate that these new entrants will materially affect our growth because the transition  from linear to on demand entertainment is so massive \\u200band because of the differing nature of our  content offerings\\u200b. We believe we’ll all continue to grow as we each invest more in content and improve  our service and as consumers continue to migrate away from linear viewing (similar to how US cable  networks collectively grew for years as viewing shifted from broadcast networks during the 1980s and  1990s).   We believe there is vast demand for watching great TV and movies and Netflix only satisfies a small  portion of that deman\\u200bd\\u200b. Last quarter, we talked about how our streaming hours in the US (our most  mature market) on TV still only represents roughly 10% of total TV usage. We are much smaller and have  even more room to grow in other countries and on other devices like mobile. For instance, Sandvine  estimates our share of global  downstream mobile internet traffic is about 2%.  1 1 The Sandvine data does not include significant data from either China or India.  4    Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Net cash used in operating activities in Q1’19 was -$380 million vs. -$237 million in the prior year period.  Free cash flow  totaled -$460 million vs. -$287 million in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, the gap  2 between net income and free cash flow is primarily driven by our investment in originals and self  produced content where the cash spending is more front end loaded than for second run licensed  programming (where cash payments are generally spread over the term of the license).  We now expect 2019 free cash flow deficit to be modestly higher at approximately -$3.5 billion due to  higher cash taxes related to the change in our corporate structure and additional investments in real  estate and other infrastructure. We’re still expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 and each year  thereafter, driven by our growing member base, revenues, and operating margins.   There’s no change to our plan to use the high yield market to finance our cash needs. We recently  upsized our revolving credit facility from $500 million to $750 million (which remains undrawn) at the  same cost and extended the term from 2022 to 2024.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bJanuary 2019\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2018\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2018\\u200b,  April 2018\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2018\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2017\\u200b,  \\u200bJuly 2017\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2017\\u200b.    2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the  reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.   5  Appendix    April 16, 2019 Earnings Interview, 3pm PST  Our video interview with Eric Sheridan of UBS will be on \\u200byoutube/netflixir\\u200b at 3pm PST today.  \\u200bQuestions  that investors would like to see asked should be sent to \\u200beric.sheridan@ubs.com\\u200b. \\u200bReed Hastings, CEO,  Spence Neumann, CFO, Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Greg Peters, Chief Product Officer and  Spencer Wang, VP of IR/Corporate Development will all be on the video to answer Eric’s questions.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  6  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding future content offerings; variability of content  obligations; product tests; impact of competition; future capital raises; ARPU; global streaming  membership growth; tax rate; impact of the change in corporate structure; U.S. and international  streaming paid memberships, paid net additions, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution  margin; consolidated revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and  earnings per share; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on February 8,  2019. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual  performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above  and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A.

       " 'FINAL-Q1-20-Shareholder-Letter': \"In our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has  reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one  knows how or when this terrible crisis will end. What’s clear is the escalating human cost in terms of lost  lives and lost jobs, with tens of millions of people now out of work.   At Netflix, we’re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to  people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to  medium term. Like other home entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and  increased membership growth. In our case, this is offset by a sharply stronger US dollar, depressing our  international revenue, resulting in revenue-as-forecast. \\u200bWe expect viewing to decline and membership  growth to decelerate as home confinement ends, which we hope is soon.   By helping people connect with stories they love, we are able to provide comfort and escape as well as a  sense of community during this pandemic. So our focus has been on maintaining the quality of our  service while our employees around the world adapt to working from home.   For the most part, this has gone smoothly. Our product teams, for example, have been relatively  unaffected. As a precaution, we have temporarily reduced the number of product innovations we try,  while continuing to release features that we know will add meaningful value for our members, such as  improved parental controls.   However, we have seen significant disruption when it comes to customer support and content  production. On the customer support side, we’ve now fixed most of our work-from-home challenges. In  addition, we’ve taken on another 2,000 agents (all working remotely), so our customer service levels are  almost fully restored despite the increased demand.   When it comes to production, almost all filming has now been stopped globally, with the exception of a  few countries like Korea and Iceland. This has been devastating for millions of workers in the TV and film  industry - electricians, hair and make-up artists, carpenters and drivers who are often paid hourly wages  and work project-to-project.   In March, we created a \\u200b$100 million fund\\u200b to help with hardship in the industry, starting with the hardest  hit workers on our productions, where Netflix has the greatest responsibility. We will have paid these  crews for about seven weeks, with the goal of providing a bridge until government safety nets kick in. In  addition, we’re donating $30 million to third parties and non-profits, providing emergency relief to  out-of-work crew and cast across the broader TV and film industry in countries where we have a large  production base.   This includes donations of $1 million each to the \\u200bSAG-AFTRA Foundation COVID-19 Disaster Fund\\u200b, the  Motion Picture and Television Fund\\u200b and the \\u200bActors Fund Emergency Assistance\\u200b in the US, and $1 million  between the \\u200bAFC\\u200b and \\u200bFondation des Artistes\\u200b in Canada. These are all well established hardship funds. In  1  other countries where no such funds exist, we’ve been working to set them up, including in the UK (£1  million) with the \\u200bBritish Film Institute\\u200b, in Italy (€1 million) with the \\u200bItalian Film Commission\\u200b, in France (€1  million) with \\u200bAudiens\\u200b, in Brazil (R$5 million) with the \\u200bBrazilian Institute of Audiovisual Content\\u200b, in Mexico  ($1 million) with the \\u200bMexican Academy of Film Arts and Sciences\\u200b, in Spain (\\u200b€\\u200b1 million) with the \\u200bMinistry  of Culture and Sport, Accion Cultural and the Film Academy\\u200b and in the Netherlands (\\u200b€\\u200b1 million) with the  Netherlands Film Fund\\u200b.   In total, we have committed to spend $150 million supporting the industry through this crisis.   Netflix’s culture is designed to empower decision making at all levels of the company. Throughout this  crisis, our employees have been working tirelessly to maintain the quality of our service and to find  quick, practical solutions to the problems Netflix and our partners face.   For example, within two weeks of the shelter-in-place orders coming into effect in Los Angeles, most of  our animation production team was back up and running, working from home. On the post production  side, we’ve been able to get 200+ projects going remotely. Most of our series writers’ rooms are  operating virtually. However, we’ve been unable to create dubs in Italian and some other languages due  to home confinement of our voice talent for a handful of titles launching in April and May. But we hope  that with the help of guilds around the world, voice actors can be set up from home, ensuring that they  can stay safe and continue to earn a living. Similar efforts are underway for both music and visual  effects.   This pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a strong Internet like never before. Over the years,  we’ve invested heavily in Open Connect, a pioneering caching system that puts our library of content as  close to members’ homes as possible. This enables ISPs to run their networks more efficiently and at a  lower cost. However, given the surge in internet use, networks in some countries have struggled to  cope.   In March, we were asked by a number of governments and ISPs to temporarily reduce the network  traffic of our members. Using our Open Connect technology, our engineering team was able to respond  immediately, \\u200breducing network use by 25 percent\\u200b virtually overnight in those countries, while also  substantially maintaining the quality of our service, including in higher definition. We’re now working  with ISPs to help increase capacity so that we can lift these limitations as conditions improve.   Netflix employees have been outstanding and to help them support their local communities, we’ve  doubled our charitable match giving program for 2020. So for every $1 donated by our employees to an  organization, we now donate an additional $2 to that organization.   Last, and most important of all, we want to say thank you on behalf of all our employees to the heroic  doctors, nurses and first responders fighting this pandemic on the frontlines and the grocery, restaurant  and other essential workers who take risks to make sure our families are fed and taken care of. We are  truly inspired and humbled by you.  Our summary results for Q1 and our Q2 forecast can be found in the table below.   2    Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast  Despite paid net additions that were higher than forecast, revenue was in-line with our guidance due to  the appreciation in the US dollar vs. other currencies. Excluding a -$115m impact from F/X, streaming  ARPU grew 8% year over year. Operating margin of 16.6% (vs. 10.2% in the prior year quarter) was lower  than our 18.0% forecast as we incurred $218m in incremental content costs due to paused productions  and hardship fund commitments (a 3.8 percentage point impact to operating margin).   There are three primary effects on our financial performance from the crisis. First, our membership  growth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement. Second, our international revenue will  be less than previously forecast due to the dollar rising sharply. Third, due to the production shutdown,  some cash spending on content will be delayed, improving our free cash flow, and some title releases  will be delayed, typically by a quarter. More on each of these three effects below.   During the first two months of Q1, our membership growth was similar to the prior two years, including  in UCAN. Then, with lockdown orders in many countries starting in March, many more households  joined Netflix to enjoy entertainment. This timing of paid membership additions also affected our Q1’20  global streaming ARPU; this was the primary driver of the sequential decline in streaming ARPU as the  revenue impact from these additions late in the quarter will be mostly felt in Q2’20 and beyond.  Hopefully, progress against the virus will allow governments to lift the home confinement soon. As that  happens, we expect viewing and growth to decline. Our internal forecast and guidance is for 7.5 million  global paid net additions in Q2. Given the uncertainty on home confinement timing, this is mostly  guesswork. The actual Q2 numbers could end up well below or well above that, depending on many  3  factors including when people can go back to their social lives in various countries and how much people  take a break from television after the lockdown. Some of the lockdown growth will turn out to be  pull-forward from the multi-year organic growth trend, resulting in slower growth after the lockdown is  lifted country-by-country. Intuitively, the person who didn’t join Netflix during the entire confinement is  not likely to join soon after the confinement. Plus, last year we had new seasons of \\u200bMoney Heist\\u200b and  Stranger Things\\u200b in Q3, which were not planned for this year’s Q3. Therefore, we currently guess that  Q3’20 and Q4’20 will have lower net additions than last year due to these effects.   Second, partially due to the crisis, the US dollar has appreciated significantly, which creates a drag on  international revenue growth. As an example, the price for our standard plan in Brazil is R$33, which  used to be $8.5 last year but now is $6.5 based on April 2020 F/X rates, so we have a ~25% decline in US  dollar average subscription price from Brazil, which offsets strong membership growth.   Third, we’ve paused most of our productions across the world in response to government lockdowns  and guidance from local public health officials. In Q2, there is only a modest impact on our new releases,  which is primarily language dubbing. No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart  physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible,  and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages, and post-production) will play out. The  impact on us is less cash spending this year as some content projects are pushed out. We are working  hard to complete the content we know our members want and we’re complementing this effort with  additional licensed films and series.   Our content competitors and suppliers will be impacted about as much as we are, in terms of new titles.  Since we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our  member satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers’ by a shortage of new content, but it will take  time to tell.   We continue to target a 16% operating margin for the full year 2020, despite the extra costs in Q1. As a  reminder, more than half of our revenue is not denominated in US dollars and we don’t hedge our  foreign exchange exposure. If the US dollar remains at these elevated levels (or strengthens further), we  may target modestly slower growth in our annual operating margin progression next year. Given that  lead time, we believe we can readjust our model to be appropriate in that new stronger US dollar world.  Content  As people shelter at home, our hope is that we can help make that experience more bearable by  providing a diverse range of high quality content for our members. While our productions are largely  paused around the world, we benefit from a large pipeline of content that was either complete and  ready for launch or in post-production when filming stopped.  For Q2, we’re looking forward to releasing all of our originally planned shows and films (with some  language dubbing impacts on a few titles). We’re also finding ways to bolster our programming this year  - including the recent acquisition of Paramount’s and Media Rights Capital’s \\u200bThe Lovebirds\\u200b, a comedy  starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, for Q2’20 and Legendary Pictures’ \\u200bEnola Holmes\\u200b starring Millie  Bobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin, for Q3 ‘20. So, while we’re certainly  4  impacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety  of new titles throughout 2020 and 2021.  Our Q1 slate highlighted the variety of content that people enjoy en masse all over the world on Netflix:  scripted English language series like \\u200bOzark\\u200b season 3 (a projected 29m member households will have  chosen to watch this season in its first four weeks), the riveting docu-series \\u200bTiger King: Murder, Mayhem  and Madness \\u200b(64m), our breakthrough unscripted dating show \\u200bLove is Blind\\u200b (30m), original film \\u200bSpenser  Confidential\\u200b (85m), and season four of the Spanish language hit \\u200bLa Casa de Papel\\u200b, aka \\u200bMoney Heist\\u200b (a  projected 65m), which debuted in early April.  In Q2, we are looking forward to the launch of\\u200b Space Force\\u200b, our new original comedy series created by  Greg Daniels (\\u200bThe Office\\u200b) and Steve Carell, starring Carell, John Malkovich and Lisa Kudrow. We just  launched our latest buzzy unscripted series \\u200bToo Hot to Handle,\\u200b \\u200b#BlackAF\\u200b from Kenya Barris and, outside  the US, the Michael Jordan documentary \\u200bThe Last Dance\\u200b, which we co-produced with ESPN (launching  on Netflix in the US on July 19)\\u200b. \\u200bWe will also premiere\\u200b \\u200bHollywood\\u200b \\u200bfrom Ryan Murphy, and, later this  week, \\u200bExtraction\\u200b, a large scale action film starring Chris Hemsworth and directed by Sam Hargrave, who  was the stunt coordinator and choreographer on films like \\u200bAvengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War,  Deadpool 2, \\u200band\\u200b Captain America: Civil War.   Product  In February, we rolled out our \\u200bTop 10 most popular lists\\u200b to nearly 100 countries, after testing this  feature last year in the UK and Mexico. In each of these countries, there are now three daily lists: Top 10  overall, Top 10 series and Top 10 films. Our goal with this feature is to help members find great TV  shows and films and enable them to be part of the cultural zeitgeist in their country.  Recently, we’ve also enhanced our parental controls for our service to improve the experience for family  members of all ages. \\u200bUpdates\\u200b include (i) PIN-controlled access to content by maturity level; (ii) the  ability to PIN protect specific titles as well as profiles; (iii) Profile-level content filtering; (iv) the ability to  create kids’ experiences that can be customized for different age groups (‘teens and below,’ ‘older kids  and below’ and ‘little kids’); and (v) the ability to disable post-play for kids from account settings.   Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q1, net cash used in operating activities was +$260 million vs. -$380 million in the prior year period.  Free cash flow  totaled +$162 million compared with -$460 million in the year ago quarter. As we stated  1 last quarter, our FCF profile is beginning to improve due to growing operating margin and profits and as  we digest our big move into the production of Netflix originals (which requires more cash upfront vs.  later-window content) that started five years ago.   With our productions currently paused, this will shift out some cash spending on content to future  years. As a result, we’re now expecting 2020 FCF of -$1 billion or better (compared with our prior 2020  expectation of -$2.5 billion and -$3.3 billion actual in 2019). This dynamic may result in more lumpiness  1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the  reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.  5  in our path to sustained FCF profitability (as, prior to the pandemic, we had been planning for annual  improvement in FCF). However, there has been no material change to our overall time table to reach  consistent annual positive FCF and we believe that 2019 will still represent the peak in our annual FCF  deficit.  We finished the quarter with cash of $5.2 billion, while our $750m unsecured credit facility remains  undrawn. Combined with our improved FCF outlook for 2020, we have more than 12 months of liquidity  and substantial financial flexibility. Our financing strategy remains unchanged - our current plan is to  continue to use debt to finance our investment needs.

However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter': 'Revenue grew 24% year over year and was in line with our beginning of quarter forecast, while operating profit and margin reached all-time highs. We finished Q1’21 with 208m paid memberships, up 14% year over year, but below our guidance forecast of 210m paid memberships. We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays. We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup. In the short-term, there is some uncertainty from Covid-19; in the long-term, the rise of streaming to replace linear TV around the world is the clear trend in entertainment. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Average revenue per membership rose 6% year over year, or 5%, excluding a foreign exchange impact of 1 +$80m. Operating income of $2 billion vs. $958 million more than doubled vs. Q1’20. This exceeded our guidance forecast primarily due to the timing of content spend. EPS of $3.75 vs. $1.57 a year ago included a $253m non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The extraordinary events of Covid-19 led to unprecedented membership growth in 2020, as it pulled forward growth from 2021, and delayed production across every region. In turn, we ended 2020 with a bigger membership and revenue base than we would otherwise have had, contributing to record Q1’21 revenues. And since we were still ramping production levels late last year, we had lower content spend in 1 Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 Q1’21 - content amortization only grew 9.5% year over year in Q1’21 vs. 17% in FY20. The result was a 10 percentage point year over year jump in our operating margin to 27% in Q1, which is an all-time high. As we discussed in past letters, these dynamics are also contributing to a lighter content slate in the first half of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth. In Q1, paid net additions of 4m were below our 6m guidance (and the 16m net additions in the year ago quarter) primarily due to acquisition, as retention in Q1 was in line with our expectations. We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor in the variance as the over-forecast was across all of our regions. We also saw similar percentage year-over-year declines in paid net adds in all regions (see our Regional Breakdown table below), whereas the level of competitive intensity varies by country. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and, in others, it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net additions performance vs. forecast. With similar pull forward and delayed slate dynamics plus our typical seasonality expected to impact Q2’21, we project paid net additions of 1m (vs. 10m in the prior year quarter) with our UCAN and LATAM regions expected to be roughly flattish in memberships (+/- a couple hundred thousand paid net adds). We anticipate paid membership growth will re-accelerate in the second half of 2021 as we ramp into a very strong back half slate with the return of big hits like Sex Education, The Witcher, La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), and You, as well as an exciting array of original films including the finale to The Kissing Booth trilogy and large scale, star-driven features like Red Notice (starring Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds) and Don’t Look Up (with an all-star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and Meryl Streep). We’ll also have our most comprehensive offering to date of local language titles including Too Hot to Handle for Brazil and Mexico, 2 a special based on our Korean hit franchise Kingdom, the action-thriller Dhamaka (India), as well as new seasons of Sintonia (Brazil), and Control Z (Mexico). As always, we’re focusing on the fundamentals of our business, which remain healthy. In addition to our record financial results, engagement per member household grew solidly year over year in Q1’21. We’re also seeing how much members value Netflix with Q1’21 churn below Q1‘20 levels, demonstrating that as we improve the service, we can charge a bit more. Our FY21 operating margin target of 20% vs. 18% last year remains unchanged. We are optimistic about the future and believe we are still in the early days of the adoption of internet entertainment, which should provide us with many years of growth ahead. Content As seen in the weekly growth chart above, in early Q1, with the benefit of Bridgerton, Lupin and Cobra Kai, we were following a growth trajectory similar to recent years. As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will lead to a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises. And while the roll out of vaccines is very uneven across the world, we are back up and producing safely in every major market, with the exception of Brazil and India. Assuming this continues, we’ll spend over $17 billion in cash on content this year and we’ll continue to deliver an amazing range of titles for our members with more originals this year than last. There are several facets to our content strategy. First and foremost, we want to deliver a wide variety of best-in-class stories that our members love and watch in big numbers. Examples of this breadth in Q1 include season one of Firefly Lane (49m chose to watch this title in its first 28 days), season 3 of Cobra Kai (45m), Fate: The Winx Saga (57m), and Ginny & Georgia (52m). Our top movies in Q1 include I Care A Lot (56m), YES DAY (62m), Outside the Wire (66m) and the last installment of To All the Boys I’ve Loved 3 Before trilogy (51m). We program across many genres because tastes are very diverse. Even for one person, what they desire will vary widely depending on their mood or who they are watching with. Another goal is to create great, locally authentic stories in countries all around the world. It’s why our priority for local language titles is to have a big impact in the home territory so we don’t sacrifice local impact for “travelability.” But we’re increasingly seeing that these local titles find significant audiences around the world, which supports our thesis that great stories are universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Notable standouts this quarter include Below Zero from Spain (47m chose to watch in its first four weeks), Space Sweepers from Korea (26m), Squared Love from Poland (31m) and Who Killed Sara? from Mexico (an estimated 55m), which is also our most popular non-English title ever in the US in its first 28 days (with season 2 launching on May 19). We want our titles to be talked about by audiences across the globe. Because of our broad distribution and highly engaged members, our titles not only generate high levels of viewing but also can pierce the cultural zeitgeist and transcend the film and TV industry. There were two recent standout examples of this: Lupin, our French language series about a daring gentleman burglar played by Omar Sy, was not only our most popular new title this quarter on Netflix (76m member households chose to watch in the first 28 days), but it also propelled book sales of the novel in France; Lupin: Part 2 will debut later in Q2’21. Similarly, driven by the late December launch of season one of Bridgerton, Julia Quinn’s books hit The New York Times bestseller list for the first time in 18 years. Netflix led all studios for recent award nominations including the Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG Awards, BAFTA and the NAACP Image Awards, among others. Heading into the Academy Awards this weekend, we have 36 nominations across 17 films including two nominees in each of the Best Picture (Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7), Best Documentary Feature (Crip Camp, My Octopus Teacher), and Best Animated Feature (Over the Moon, A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon) categories. Mank led all films with 10 nominations. Product We are constantly working to make it easier for members to access and enjoy something they will love, regardless of their location or mood. In Q1, we launched an opt-in Downloads for You feature for Android (with iOS coming soon) that automatically downloads recommended shows and movies onto a member\\'s mobile device, ensuring that they always have something to watch irrespective of connectivity. Knowing that bandwidth and storage can be precious, this feature tries to choose only the most relevant content to download. This quarter we also launched Fast Laughs, a mobile feed of short comedy clips from Netflix favorites - it\\'s initially available in several countries including the US on iOS and will be on Android soon. For television viewers, this month we unveiled an updated and improved experience for Kids Profile that more vividly and easily connects children with their favorite titles and characters. 4 Competition We compete with many activities for consumers’ entertainment time, ranging from watching linear TV, video gaming, and viewing user generated content, just to name a few. Against this backdrop, the entertainment market is huge, giving us plenty of room to grow, if we can continue to improve our service. We believe we are less than 10% of TV screen time in the US and even smaller in other regions and when including mobile devices. More and more new streaming services are launching, reinforcing our vision that linear TV will slowly give way to streaming entertainment. Despite our 10+ year head start, we are continually seeking operational and creative excellence; we’re working as hard as ever to continually improve our service so that we are the best entertainment option available with best in class stories, an ever-improving product experience and authentic local titles that our members love. Our ability to evolve from a DVD-by-mail to an internet entertainment business, from a US-only to a global service, and from a licensor of second window content to a producer of original content across so many different categories fuels our confidence and optimism for our next decade of challenges, growth and innovation. When comparing services, subscriber figures alone tell only part of the story (given bundles, discounts and other promotions) so it’s important to also focus on engagement and revenue as key indicators of success; they drive the flywheel of investment in even more amazing stories for our members and future growth. It’s our job to please our members so much on Monday, that on Tuesday, they start with us, and then they stick with us as their first choice for entertainment. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $777 million vs. $260 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was $692 million vs. $162 million in Q1‘20. We are on track 2 for full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately break even. As we discussed last quarter, we believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive and that we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repaid our 5.375% February 1, 2021 bond ($500 million principal) out of balance sheet cash, reducing our total gross debt balance to $15.7 billion as of March 31, 2021. We intend to maintain $10-$15 billion of gross debt. Our board has approved a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock beginning in 2021 with no fixed expiration date. We expect our buyback program will begin this quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We’ve added a new section to our investor relations site that collates all of our ESG information for our investors, including our recently published 2020 ESG Report (filed March 30, 2021). Our 2020 ESG report includes our commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022. We also 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5 released our first Inclusion Report around the makeup of our workforce and a third-party diversity audit of our content by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, designed to set industry benchmarks around these important issues.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

       " 'FINAL-Q1-22-Shareholder-Letter': 'Our revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show. Streaming is winning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently. While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth - through improvements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing - we’ll be holding our operating margin at around 20%. Key to our success has been our ability to create amazing entertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewing than our competitors. These are Netflix\\'s core strengths and competitive advantages. Together with our strong profitability, we believe we have the foundation from which we can both significantly improve, and better monetize, our service longer term. Growth Outlook Since launching streaming in 2007, we’ve operated under the firm belief that internet-delivered, on demand entertainment will supplant linear TV, and that this transition represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a highly popular and profitable entertainment company. People love movies, TV shows and games; broadband and smart TV penetration continue to grow globally with more and more connected devices; and while hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world’s broadband homes don’t yet, representing huge future growth potential. 1 In the near term though, we’re not growing revenue as fast as we’d like. COVID clouded the picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021 was due to the COVID pull forward. Now, we believe there are four main inter-related factors at work. First, it’s increasingly clear that the pace of growth into our underlying addressable market (broadband homes) is partly dependent on factors we don’t directly control, like the uptake of connected TVs (since the majority of our viewing is on TVs), the adoption of on-demand entertainment, and data costs. We believe these factors will keep improving over time, so that all broadband households will be potential Netflix customers. Second, in addition to our 222m paying households, we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over 100m additional households, including over 30m in the UCAN region. Account sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn’t changed much over the years, but, coupled with the first factor, means it’s harder to grow membership in many markets - an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth. Third, competition for viewing with linear TV as well as YouTube, Amazon, and Hulu has been robust for the last 15 years. However, over the last three years, as traditional entertainment companies realized streaming is the future, many new streaming services have also launched. While our US television viewing share, for example, has been steady to up according to Nielsen, we want to grow that share faster. Higher view share is an indicator of higher satisfaction, which supports higher retention and revenue. Fourth, macro factors, including sluggish economic growth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID are likely having an impact as well. 2 Our plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix - in particular the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our members value most. On the content side, we’re doubling down on story development and creative excellence, which we see reflected in big Q1’22 TV hits like Bridgerton (627 million hours viewed for season 2 *, our 1 biggest English language series in our history) and Inventing Anna (512m hours viewed) - both from our extremely successful partnership with Shonda Rhimes - and films like Tinder Swindler (166m hours viewed, our biggest documentary film ever released) and The Adam Project (233m hours viewed), which come on the back of our Q4 hits Red Notice and Don’t Look Up. On the product side, we recently launched “double thumbs up” so members can better express what they truly love versus simply like - enabling us to continue to improve our personalized recommendations and overall experience. This focus on continuous improvement has served us well over the past 25 years - from our big battle with Blockbuster nearly 20 years ago through the launch and growth of streaming, to the switch from licensed second run TV series and films to original programming, and our development from a domestic business with primarily English language content to a global entertainment service. It’s why we are now the largest subscription streaming service in the world on all key metrics: paid memberships, engagement, revenue and profit. Another focus is how best to monetize sharing - the 100M+ households using another household’s account. This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying our service. Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. And we\\'ve always tried to make sharing within a member’s household easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams. While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households. So early last year we started testing different approaches to monetize sharing and, in March, introduced two new paid sharing features, where current members have the choice to pay for additional households, in three markets in Latin America. There’s a broad range of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing. So while we won’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity. As we work to monetize sharing, growth in ARM, revenue and viewing will become more important indicators of our success than membership growth. Over the longer term, much of our growth will come from outside the US. Traditionally, US entertainment companies have viewed “international” as an export market for US content. But we saw long ago that great stories can be made anywhere and loved everywhere - dramatically broadening the pool of creators with whom we can work, increasing the variety of our programming and better serving local tastes. To support this, we’ve been building out capabilities like creative development, personalization, and language presentation/localization. Netflix is now producing films and TV in more than 50 countries with a high degree of integration in the local entertainment ecosystem resulting in the creation of blockbusters from every region. In fact, three out of our six most popular TV seasons of all time are non-English language titles: Squid Game, La Casa de Papel Part 4 and All Of Us Are Dead, which 1 Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through April 17, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed at Netflix Top 10. 3 launched in Q1’22 and has accumulated 561m hours viewed in its first four weeks. So an important focus is working to extend our lead in this area. Our goal is to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating income even faster (as we expand margins) and generate growing positive free cash flow (FCF). During this period of slower revenue growth, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange (F/X), we aim to protect our profitability and manage to a minimum operating margin roughly in line with current levels (i.e., this year’s 19-20% guidance). Once we’ve re-accelerated revenue growth, we’re committed to steadily growing our operating margin. Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast Our 10% revenue growth in Q1’22 was driven by an 8% year over year increase in average streaming paid memberships and 2% year over year growth in ARM . Excluding a F/X impact of -$280 million, year over 2 year revenue and ARM growth were +14% and +6%, respectively. Operating income of $2.0 billion was above our beginning of quarter forecast of $1.8 billion due to lower than projected content expense. EPS of $3.53 vs. $3.75 a year ago included a $162 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Paid net additions were -0.2m compared against our guidance forecast of 2.5m and 4.0m in the same quarter a year ago. The suspension of our service in Russia and winding-down of all Russian paid memberships resulted in a -0.7m impact on paid net adds; excluding this impact, paid net additions totaled +0.5m. The main challenge for membership growth is continued soft acquisition across all regions. Retention was also slightly lower relative to our guidance forecast, although it remains at a very healthy level (we believe among the best in the industry). Recent price changes are largely tracking in-line with our expectations and remain significantly revenue positive. In EMEA (-0.3M paid net adds, or +0.4m excluding the Russia impact), we saw a slowdown in our business in Central and Eastern Europe in March, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Paid net additions in LATAM totaled -0.4M; similar to recent quarters, we believe a combination of forces including macroeconomic weakness and our price changes (F/X neutral ARM grew 20% year over year) were a drag on our membership growth. UCAN paid net adds of -0.6M was largely the result of our price change which is tracking in-line with our expectations and is significantly revenue positive. We’re making good progress in APAC where we are seeing nice growth in a variety of markets including Japan, India, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q2’22, we forecast paid net additions of -2.0m vs. +1.5m in the year ago quarter. Our forecast assumes our current trends persist (such as slow acquisition and the near term impact of price changes) plus typical seasonality (Q2 paid net adds are usually less than Q1 paid net adds). We project revenue to grow approximately 10% year over year in Q2, assuming roughly a mid-to-high single digit year over year 2 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 4 increase in ARM on a F/X neutral basis. We still target a 19%-20% operating margin for the full year 2022, assuming no material swings in F/X rates from when we set this goal in January of 2022. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $923 million vs. $777 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow amounted to $802 million vs. $692 million. We continue to expect to be free cash 3 flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. During the quarter, we completed two acquisitions (leading visual effects company Scanline and gaming studio Boss Fight Entertainment), which had a -$125 million impact on cash. We also announced our purchase of Helsinki-based gaming company Next Games. We’ve completed the tender offer and expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2022. We finished Q1 with gross debt of $14.6 billion after repaying $700 million of our senior notes. We’re now within the top end of our gross debt target range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $6.0 billion, net debt was $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter, equating to a 1.3x LTM leverage ratio . Given those uses 4 of cash and our minimum cash target, we didn’t engage in share repurchase activity during the quarter. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We recently published our 2021 ESG Report (March 30, 2022). We’ve made good progress on our climate commitments announced last year - reducing or avoiding more than 14,000 metric tons of emissions in 2021. This enabled us to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 footprint by more than 10% from what it otherwise would have been and puts us on track to cut 45% of these emissions by 2030. We continue to develop our inclusion lens. In 2021, women made up 51.7% of our global workforce , up 5 from 48.7% in 2020. Half of our US workforce (50.5%) is made up of people from one or more historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds, including Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern, Native American, and Pacific Islander . That’s up from 46.8% in the previous year. The number of US 6 Black employees increased from 8.6% to 10.7% and Black leadership increased from 10.9% to 13.3%. The number of US Hispanic or Latino employees increased from 7.9% to 8.6%, and US Hispanic or Latino leadership grew slightly from 4.3% to 4.4%. As noted in our last investor letter and our 2022 preliminary proxy, the board has decided to recommend to shareholders that Netflix evolve to a more standard large cap company governance structure. At this year’s annual meeting in June, we’ll present proposals to declassify our board, remove supermajority 6 Categories based on US reporting requirements. 5 2020 numbers as of December 2020, and 2021 numbers as of December 2021. 4 Defined as net debt divided by last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA (Net income before interest expense and other income/expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and further adjusted to exclude other non-cash charges). 3 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 5 voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings.

Regional Breakdown 6 April 19, 2022 Earnings Interview, 3pm PT Our video interview with Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan will be on youtube/netflixir at 3pm PT today. Questions that investors would like to see asked should be sent to douglas.anmuth@jpmorgan.com. Reed Hastings, co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, co-CEO & Chief Content Officer, Greg Peters, COO & Chief Product Officer, Spence Neumann, CFO, and Spencer Wang, VP of IR/Corporate Development will all be on the video to answer Doug’s questions. IR Contact: Spencer Wang VP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development 408 809-5360 PR Contact: Jonathan Bing Director, Corporate Communications 818 643-0146 Use of Non-GAAP Measures This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of free cash flow, last twelve months (“LTM”) leverage ratio, and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow, LTM leverage ratio and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       " 'Final-Q1-23-Shareholder-Letter': 'Summary:  Q1‘23 revenue and operating profit were in-line with our forecast.  We delivered a strong content slate in Q1 with: ○ Successful returning seasons like Outer Banks, You, Ginny & Georgia and a big sequel film Murder Mystery 2. ○ New hits across nearly every genre of TV like The Night Agent (now our 6th most popular English language TV show ever), The Glory (our 5th most popular non-English TV show ever), Full Swing, That 90s Show and films You People and Luther: The Fallen Sun.  With Moody’s recent upgrade, we achieved investment grade status. Netflix is the leading streaming service based on engagement, revenue and profit and we are working to build on that in ‘23, by seeking to expand operating margin to 18%-20% and to generate at least +$3.5B of free cash flow (up from our prior expectation of at least $3.0B of FCF).  In Q1, we launched paid sharing in four countries and are pleased with the results. We are planning on a broad rollout, including in the US, in Q2.  Given current healthy performance and trajectory of our per-member advertising economics, particularly in the US, we’re upgrading our ads experience with more streams and improved video quality to attract a broader range of consumers. In short, we’re off to a good start in 2023. As always, our focus remains pleasing our members and attracting great creators so that we can continue to build a wildly successful business. (in millions except per share data) Q1\\'22 Q2\\'22 Q3\\'22 Q4\\'22 Q1\\'23 Q2\\'23 Forecast Revenue $7,868 $7,970 $7,926 $7,852 $8,162 $8,242 Y/Y % Growth 9.8% 8.6% 5.9% 1.9% 3.7% 3.4% Operating Income $1,972 $1,578 $1,533 $550 $1,714 $1,565 Operating Margin 25.1% 19.8% 19.3% 7.0% 21.0% 19.0% Net Income $1,597 $1,441 $1,398 $55 $1,305 $1,283 Diluted EPS $3.53 $3.20 $3.10 $0.12 $2.88 $2.84 Global Streaming Paid Memberships 221.64 220.67 223.09 230.75 232.50 Y/Y % Growth 6.7% 5.5% 4.5% 4.0% 4.9% Global Streaming Paid Net Additions -0.20 -0.97 2.41 7.66 1.75 Net cash provided by operating activities $923 $103 $557 $444 $2,179 Free Cash Flow* $802 $13 $472 $332 $2,117 Shares (FD) 453.0 450.2 450.3 451.6 452.4 1 Q1 Results Revenue grew 4% year over year in Q1 (+8% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis ), consistent with 1 our beginning-of-quarter forecast. Average paid memberships increased 4% year over year, while ARM2 was -1% vs. Q1’22 (+4% on an F/X neutral basis). Paid net adds amounted to 1.8M for Q1 vs. -0.2M in the year ago quarter. Regional highlights include:  UCAN revenue grew 8% year over year (both reported and F/X neutral) driven by a 9% increase in ARM (both reported and F/X neutral).  EMEA revenue was down 2% year over year (+6% on an F/X neutral basis), due primarily to a decline of 6% in ARM (+1% on an F/X neutral basis), offset partially by a 4% increase in average paid memberships.  LATAM revenue increased 7% year over year (+13% F/X neutral), with a 3% rise in ARM (+8% F/X neutral). Paid membership dipped by 0.4M, which we believe is due to pull forward from Q4 (when we had a big quarter with 1.8M paid net adds) and ongoing macroeconomic softness.  APAC revenue grew 2% year over year (+10% F/X neutral). Average paid memberships increased 17% year over year. This offset a 13% decrease in ARM (-6% F/X neutral), which was due to plan mix and a higher mix of member growth in countries with lower pricing. Operating income totaled $1.7B vs. $2.0B in Q1‘22 - above our guidance forecast of $1.6B due to ongoing expense management and timing of hiring and content spend. Operating margin was 21% compared to 25% in the year ago period. The year over year decline in operating margin was primarily due to F/X - the appreciation of the US dollar accounted for roughly three percentage points of the year over year change in operating margin. Q1’23 EPS of $2.88 (vs. $3.53 in Q1‘22) was in-line with our guidance of $2.82 and included an $81 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Forecast Our primary financial metrics are revenue for growth and operating margin for profitability. Our long term financial objectives are unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expand operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. We strive for accuracy although the rollout of major new initiatives (paid sharing and ads) leads to less-than-normal visibility. We’re on track to meet our full year 2023 financial objectives. For Q2’23, we forecast revenue of $8.2B, up 3% year over year, or 6% growth on an F/X neutral basis. We’re pleased with the most recent launches of paid sharing, and while we could have launched broadly in Q1, we found opportunities to improve the experience for members. We learn more with each rollout and we’ve incorporated the latest learnings, which we think will lead to even better results. To implement these changes, we shifted 2 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchange rate movements. Assumes foreign exchange rates remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. 2 out the timing of the broad launch from late Q1 to Q2. While this means that some of the expected membership growth and revenue benefit will fall in Q3 rather than Q2, we believe this will result in a better outcome for both our members and our business (more details in the Monetization and Revenue section). The majority of our year over year F/X neutral revenue growth in Q2 is expected to come from growth in our paid membership base. This translates into Q2 paid net adds that are roughly similar to Q1’23 and a slight increase in year over year F/X neutral ARM (limited price increases during paid sharing rollout). We forecast Q2’23 operating income of $1.6B (roughly flat year over year) and an operating margin of 19% vs. 20% in Q2’22. The year over year decline in operating margin is attributable to the appreciation of the US dollar against most other currencies over the past year. We expect constant currency revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the second half of 2023 as we continue to improve our service, more broadly roll out paid sharing in Q2 and grow our advertising business. We also expect year over year operating profit growth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F/X). We’re still targeting a 2023 operating margin of 18%-20%, based on F/X rates as of January 1, 2023. We believe our ability to deliver on our long term financial targets will hinge on 1) growing engagement and 2) improving our monetization to fuel revenue growth and increased profitability. Engagement Engagement is important to success in streaming because it drives both retention (increased member 3 satisfaction) and acquisition (greater word of mouth). The third party data in the chart below shows that Netflix and YouTube are the clear leaders in streaming engagement – and that the opportunity ahead is significant as streaming still accounts for the minority of viewing in every country. We remain highly confident that streaming’s share of engagement will continue to grow at the expense of linear since it offers a better experience (on demand, availability across devices). We believe this gives Netflix tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service – increasing our share of total viewing by multiples higher than today’s 2-4% share in Brazil, Mexico and Poland, or 7- 9% share in the US and the UK. 3 For View Hours for titles, please visit Netflix Top 10. 3 tablet and laptop), all others are TV only. As our Netflix Top 10 lists show, people have very diverse tastes. To please our members we need to connect them with a title they’ll love in that moment – whether it’s an elevated drama, comedy, action adventure or reality show, versus simply engagement for engagement’s sake. The more we can consistently deliver the right titles to the right audiences at the right time, the more our members will choose Netflix when they next turn on their TV or recommend our service to their friends. It’s a virtuous flywheel, which is why our content teams are so focused on working with the best creators, and the variety and quality of our slate. In March, for example, All Quiet on the Western Front (the Oscar and BAFTA winning film) and Too Hot To Handle Germany hit our German Top 10 – two very different must watch, much loved titles that speak to the breadth of our programming ambitions. In Q1, we had several big returning series and films – demonstrating our growing ability to develop stories across genres – including Outer Banks S3, You S4, Ginny & Georgia S2, Soy Georgina S2, The Glory’s new installment and a big sequel to our hit film Murder Mystery. Building anticipation and buzz before and after titles premiere is a key goal for our Marketing team as it helps drive acquisition and retention. For example, excitement for Murder Mystery 2 drove the original film back into the top 10. For Outer Banks S3, we held our first ever live music event – Poguelandia – to drive fandom, with the title generating 2.2B social impressions to date, just ahead of You S4 with 2.1B. Our unique ability to connect creators with huge audiences of passionate fans through our near global reach, personalization, innovative marketing and publicity are key reasons storytellers want to tell their stories on Netflix. In addition, we successfully launched big new titles across a broad variety of genres – including The Night Agent, La chica de nieve, Rana Naidu, and the movie Kill Boksoon all in the thriller/action space, the golf docu series Full Swing and new dating show Perfect Match. These series are all being renewed for subsequent seasons. We’re also starting to find greater success in scripted comedies with the returning 4 season of The Upshaws and the Q1 debut of That 90’s Show (a spinoff of That 70’s Show), Machos Alfas and En Place. Similarly, our Q1 film offering included You People (with Jonah Hill and Eddie Murphy), the romantic comedy Your Place or Mine (starring Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon), as well as Murder Mystery 2 (featuring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston). In stand-up, Chris Rock’s Selective Outrage – now the most-streamed comedy special of all time in the US according to Nielsen – was one of our buzziest titles this quarter. Monetization and Revenue As we improve our member experience with more must watch stories, we also need to improve our monetization. This will not only help reaccelerate revenue growth and increase operating margin, it will also enable us to invest more in great entertainment. We want to be more sophisticated around pricing so that we offer a range of price points and feature sets to suit consumers’ differing needs. For example, when we launched globally in 2016, we took a fairly uniform approach to pricing across most countries given our focus on early adopters. Over time we’ve adapted our prices to meet local needs and to further deepen our penetration, including lowering prices in India by 20%-60% in December ‘21. These reductions – combined with an improved slate – helped grow engagement in India by nearly 30% year on year while F/X neutral revenue growth in 2022 accelerated to 24% (versus 19% in 2021). Learning from this success, we reduced prices in an additional 116 countries in Q1. While they represented less than 5% of our FY‘22 revenue, we believe that increasing adoption in these markets will help to maximize our revenue longer term. Similarly, our new ads plan allows us to offer consumers a lower price point. While it’s still very early days, we continue to be pleased with our progress across all key dimensions: member experience, value to advertisers and incremental contribution to our business. Engagement on our ads tier is above our initial expectations and, as expected, we’ve seen very little switching from our standard and premium plans. Also, thanks to our most recent set of licensing deals, our ad-supported plan now has on average ~95% content parity globally (by viewing) with our ads-free plans, including all the latest Netflix shows and movies. On the advertiser side, we are launching a programmatic private marketplace to enable more buying options for Netflix ad inventory using Microsoft’s sales platform. Our partnerships with Integral Ad Science and Double Verify are also now live – validating campaign engagement of ads viewership on Netflix. We are pleased with the current performance and trajectory of our per-member advertising economics. In the US for instance, our ads plan already has a total ARM (subscription + ads) greater than our standard plan. So this month we’ll upgrade the feature set of our ads plan to include 1080p versus 720p video quality and two concurrent streams in all 12 ads markets – starting with Canada and Spain today. We believe these enhancements will make our offering even more attractive to a broader set of consumers and further strengthen engagement for existing and new subscribers to the ads plan. Paid sharing is another important initiative as widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our ability to invest in and improve Netflix for our paying members, as well as build our business. We’re pleased with the results of our Q1 launches in Canada, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal, strengthening our confidence that we have the right approach. As with Latin America, we see a cancel 5 reaction in each market when we announce the news, which impacts near term member growth. But as borrowers start to activate their own accounts and existing members add “extra member” accounts, we see increased acquisition and revenue. For example, in Canada, which we believe is a reliable predictor for the US, our paid membership base is now larger than prior to the launch of paid sharing and revenue 4 growth has accelerated and is now growing faster than in the US. With each launch, we learn more about how best to roll out these changes and what matters to members the most, in particular maintaining travel/watching on the go and the ability for people to better control access to their accounts as well as transfer profiles to separate accounts. We could have launched broadly in late Q1, but we found enough improvement opportunities in these areas to shift a broad launch to Q2 to implement those changes. As noted above, while this will shift some of the membership growth and revenue benefit from Q2 to Q3, we believe it will result in a better outcome for our members and our business. Longer term, paid sharing will ensure a bigger revenue base from which we can grow as we improve our service. As a reminder, as we roll out paid sharing – and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don’t convert to extra members or full paying accounts – near term engagement, as measured by third parties like Nielsen, will likely shrink modestly. However, we believe the pattern will be similar to what we’ve seen in Latin America, with engagement growth resuming over time as we continue to improve our programming and borrowers sign-up for their own accounts. Competition Competition remains intense as we compete with so many forms of entertainment (linear TV, gaming, user generated content, premium streaming content, and social media to name just a few). Among our streaming video competitors, our traditional entertainment peers appear to be focused on revenue diversification (across theatrical, linear TV and third party licensing) as they manage through the hard transition from legacy businesses to streaming – whereas we are “all in” on streaming and already generating significant profit and free cash flow. The large tech companies continue to invest heavily in streaming, with a particular focus on live sports recently. We don’t focus too much on the competition because we\\'ve learned over the years that consistently great execution (better movies, TV series, and now games, better discovery and buzzier, more creative marketing) is the key to our long term success. We succeed by getting a bit better, a bit faster than the competition every month. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q1 was $2.2B vs. $0.9B in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) in Q1 totaled $2.1B compared with $0.8B in last Q1. Assuming no material swings in F/X, we 5 now expect at least $3.5B of FCF for the full year 2023, up from our prior expectation of at least $3.0B. This reflects lower cash spend on content than we originally forecasted, resulting in a year over year decrease in cash content spend (bringing our 2023 cash content to content amortization ratio closer to 5 Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. 4 Our paid membership count does not include “extra members.” Instead, they lift ARM. 6 1.0x in 2023). For 2024, we still expect our cash content spend to be in the range of roughly $17B, consistent with our prior expectations for the 2022-2024 period. In Q1, Moody’s upgraded our credit rating to Baa3. Combined with our BBB credit rating from S&P, we are now investment grade. Gross debt at quarter end totaled $14.5B, in-line with our targeted range of $10-$15B. With cash and short term investments of $7.8B, net debt totaled $6.7B, or 1.1x LTM EBITDA.6 Our capital structure policy is unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new opportunities like gaming and ads, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (e.g., about $5.4B based on Q1 revenue). After meeting those needs, we anticipate returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases. We bought back 1.2M shares for $400M in Q1. We currently expect to accelerate our share repurchases over the course of 2023. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We recently published an update on progress in our sustainability program. We continue the work to decarbonize our operations and we’ve delivered on our commitment to net all remaining emissions to zero by the end of 2022 through investing in nature-based projects that capture carbon. DVD After an incredible 25 year run, we’ve decided to wind down DVD.com later this year. Our goal has always been to provide the best service for our members but as the DVD business continues to shrink that’s going to become increasingly hard. So we want to go out on a high, and will be shipping our final DVDs on September 29, 2023. From the very beginning, our members loved the choice and control that direct-to-consumer entertainment offered, including the variety and quality of our titles and the ability to binge watch entire series. DVD paved the way for streaming, ensuring that so much of what we started will continue long into the future. We feel so privileged to have been able to share movie nights with our DVD members for so long, so proud of what our employees have achieved and excited to continue pleasing entertainment fans for many more decades to come. Thanks to all our employees over the years that worked so hard to build the booster rocket that got streaming to a leading position.

Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F/X neutral revenue and operating margin allow investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currency fluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. We are not able to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the exact amount or timing of the reconciling items, including property and equipment and change in other assets, and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our expected results for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023 and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023; adoption and growth of streaming entertainment; growth outlook and market opportunity; competitive position; core strategy and business model; content offerings; our games strategy; monetization through pricing and tiering structures, including paid sharing; ad-supported tier and its prospects; product features; our competitors’ performance; impact of foreign exchange rates; seasonality; cash balance and spend; stock repurchases; paid net additions, membership growth and retention; engagement; consolidated revenue, revenue and ARM growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, content amortization, and earnings per share; emissions commitments; advertising; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively, including for consumer engagement with different modes of entertainment; timing and adoption of the ads plan and paid sharing; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; macroeconomic conditions and timing of content releases. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on 10 January 26, 2023. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter. 11 Netflix,�Inc.�

       " 'FINAL-Q2-18-Shareholder-Letter': \"Fellow shareholders,    We had a strong but not stellar Q2, ending with 130 million memberships. Membership growth was  5.2m, the same as Q2 last year, but lower than our 6.2m forecast. Earnings, margins, and revenue were  all in-line with forecast and way up from prior year. Internet video is growing globally and we are  fortunate to be one of the leaders. In addition to succeeding commercially, we are starting to lead  artistically in some categories, with our creators earning enough Emmy nominations this year to  collectively break\\u200b HBO’s amazing 17-year run\\u200b.     1  Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast  Streaming revenue in Q2 rose 43% year over year, driven by a 26% and 14% increase in average paid  memberships and ASP, respectively. Operating margin of 11.8% expanded 720 bps year over year,  resulting in 262% growth in operating income. EPS of $0.85 vs. $0.15 included an $85 million non-cash  unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond.  As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report  and we strive for accuracy, meaning in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to  our guidance. This Q2, we over-forecasted global net additions which amounted to 5.2m vs. a forecast of  6.2m and flat compared to Q2 a year ago, as acquisition growth was slightly lower than we projected.  Paid net adds totaled 5.5m in Q2, compared with 4.7m last year and forecast of 6.1m.     US net adds of 0.7m (vs. guidance of 1.2m) were down vs. last year’s Q2-record 1.1m, but consistent  with previous Q2 performance (0.5m in Q2’12, 0.6m in Q2’13, 0.6m in Q2’14, 0.9m in Q2’15, and 0.2m in  Q2’16). Through the first six months of the year, our US net adds are slightly ahead of last year.   Internationally, 4.5m net additions grew 8% year over year on broad market growth.  Currency had a  +$65 million impact on international revenue year over year (+13% international ASP growth on a FX  neutral basis), but this positive impact was smaller than we had forecast 90 days ago as the US dollar  strengthened meaningfully\\u200b against many currencies since our Q1’18 earnings report in April. As a  reminder, we do not hedge our revenue with derivatives.  Faster growth in international markets relative to the US creates a net revenue exposure to non-USD  currencies. With the growth of our content production in 80 countries and expanding, we’ll move more  of our operating costs to non-USD to provide a little more natural hedging but we anticipate we’ll still  2  continue to have much more expense in USD than revenue. We slowly adjust pricing over time to  mitigate forex moves over the longer term, but when currency movements are rapid, they will affect our  near term operating margin. We’ll tend to outperform our near term operating margin targets on dollar  weakness and underperform on dollar strength. For the full year 2018, current F/X rates have pushed  our expectations on operating margin to be near the lower end of our 10-11% target range. We continue  to expect steady growth in operating margin in 2019 and beyond.  For Q3, we forecast global net adds of 5.0m (compared with 5.3m in Q3’17), with 0.65m and 4.35m in  the US and international segment, respectively. Paid net adds are forecast to be 5.2m, up from 5.0m in  Q3’17.   Content  Our broad slate of programming in Q2 highlights the diversity of programming we are providing. We  debuted sci-fi action series \\u200bLost in Space\\u200b, which we’ve renewed for another season. In addition, we  released the second season of one of our biggest originals \\u200b13 Reasons Why\\u200b, as well as \\u200bSanta Clarita Diet\\u200b,  A Series of Unfortunate Events\\u200b, \\u200bMarvel’s Jessica Jones\\u200b, \\u200bLa Casa de Papel\\u200b (\\u200bMoney Heist\\u200b), \\u200bGLOW\\u200b and  Marvel’s\\u200b \\u200bLuke Cage\\u200b. In original kids programming, \\u200bBoss Baby: Back in Business\\u200b became one of our  biggest kids series ever.   We continue to ramp up our production of non-English originals. In Q2, we debuted season 2 of \\u200b3%\\u200b, our  sci-fi original from Brazil\\u200b \\u200band premiered \\u200bThe Rain\\u200b, our Danish original thriller which became one of our  biggest non-English original productions yet, with viewing all over the world.  This serves as another data  point that our international originals can be important to specific countries and regions and also play  well outside of their home markets. Late in the quarter, we launched \\u200bLust Stories\\u200b, a new Indian original  film, which has been a major success as our largest watched original in percentage terms in any  individual market in its first month. \\u200bSacred Games\\u200b, our first Indian original series, launched on July 6 and  is off to a similarly strong start. We will follow \\u200bSacred Games\\u200b up in India with \\u200bGhoul\\u200b on August 24.   We were honored last week with the most Emmy nominations of any network. The 112 Netflix  nominations include five best series and best limited series nominations and are spread across 40  different scripted and unscripted series, TV movies, limited series, documentaries, talk shows, comedy  specials and series for kids. This is a testament to the fantastic creators we work with across all forms of  television.   We are making good progress with our original feature films. As traditional exhibition focuses  increasingly on superheroes and sequels, our on demand service allows us to serve a wide variety of  tastes. For example, in Q2, we had success with several \\u200bromantic comedies\\u200b such as \\u200bSet It Up\\u200b, starring  Lucy Liu, Zoey Deutch, Taye Diggs and Glen Powell and \\u200bThe Kissing Booth\\u200b, which peaked at #4 on IMDB’s  chart of most popular movies, behind only \\u200bDeadpool 2\\u200b, \\u200bThe Avengers: Infinity War\\u200b and \\u200bSolo: A Star Wars  Story\\u200b. \\u200bKissing Booth\\u200b and \\u200bSet it Up \\u200bhave been watched and loved by tens of millions of Netflix members  and the young stars of these films have seen their social media followings grow from a few thousand  into the millions in the weeks following release.  Of course, we also produce big event movies as well  and we recently announced that Michael Bay, one of the most commercially successful action directors,  will make his next film, \\u200bSix Underground\\u200b (starring Ryan Reynolds) for Netflix. Bay joins Martin Scorsese,  3  Alfonso Cuaron, Susanne Bier, Paul Greengrass, Chris Columbus and many other top directors who are  making their next feature films for Netflix.   Product and Partnerships  We continue to invest in our mobile experience. Last week, we unveiled our “Smart Downloads” feature  on Android for members that use our offline mode, which is particularly popular in emerging markets.  Now, when members finish watching a downloaded episode, it will be automatically deleted and the  next episode will be automatically downloaded. Smart Downloads works only when the device is  connected to WiFi so cellular data plans won’t be used and device storage won’t be affected since the  last watched episode will always be deleted first before the next episode is downloaded. Members also  have the option to toggle this feature on and off.   We are expanding our partner-based bundle offerings, announcing deals with Telefonica in Spain and  Latin America as well as KDDI in Japan. While the majority of our acquisition happens by consumers  signing up with us directly, bundles continue to be a high-performing additional acquisition channel. We  expect to continue to add such deals with partners around the world.  Competition  YouTube and Netflix are two leading global (ex-China) internet entertainment services.  HBO and Disney  are evolving to focus on internet entertainment services. Amazon and Apple are investing in content as  part of larger ecosystem subscriptions. Each of these firms has unique content and is striving to find the  best creators from around the world to entertain its viewers. There has never been a better time to be a  creator or consumer of content.   We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties  to have attractive offerings. We anticipate more competition from the combined AT&T/Warner Media,  from the combined Fox/Disney or Fox/Comcast as well as from international players like Germany’s  ProSieben and \\u200bSalto\\u200b in France. Our strategy is to simply keep improving, as we’ve been doing every year  in the past.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow in Q2 totaled -$559 million vs. -$608 million in the year ago quarter. We continue to  anticipate FCF of -$3 to -$4 billion for the full year 2018, which implies that our content cash spending  will be weighted to the second half of 2018. During Q2, we completed our latest bond deal, raising $1.9  billion. At the end of Q2, our gross debt balance stood at $8.4 billion and we had a cash balance of $3.9  billion and a $500 million undrawn credit facility. Our debt-to-EV is currently about 5%.  While interest rates have risen and the federal tax rate is now lower (reducing the tax shield on interest  costs), we judge that our after-tax cost of debt continues to be lower than our cost of equity, so we  anticipate that we’ll continue to finance our capital needs in the high yield market.     4  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bApril 2018\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2018\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2017\\u200b,  July 2017\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2017\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2017\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2016\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2016\\u200b.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding foreign exchange rate fluctuations and impact on  revenue; growth of content production; accuracy of guidance; paid net adds; operating cost currency;  operating margin; seasonality; profitability; content strategy, including future content launches; partner  based bundled offerings; impact of competition; mergers and acquisitions involving competitors; free  cash flow; future capital raises; our credit rating and its impact on interest rates for capital raises;  domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating  income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  5  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February  5, 2018. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual  performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above  and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A.

       " 'FINAL-Q2-20-Shareholder-Letter-V3-with-Tables': \"Fellow shareholders,  We live in uncertain times with restrictions on what we can do socially and many people are turning to  entertainment for relaxation, connection, comfort and stimulation. In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant  pull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million  paid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million). As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020  compared to the prior year. As we navigate these turbulent circumstances, we’re focused on our  members by continuing to improve the quality of our service and bringing new films and shows to  people's screens. Our Q2 summary results and forecast for Q3 are in the table below.     Ted Sarandos appointed co-CEO and elected to Board of  Directors  Ted joined Netflix over 20 years ago, and we are thrilled to appoint him to be co-CEO with Reed.  “Ted  has been my partner for decades. This change makes formal what was already informal -- that Ted and I  share the leadership of Netflix,” says Hastings.  Lead Independent director Jay Hoag says “Having  watched Reed and Ted work together for so long, the board and I are confident this is the right step to  evolve Netflix’s management structure so that we can continue to best serve our members and  shareholders for years to come.”   1  Ted will also continue to serve as Chief Content Officer. In addition, Greg Peters has been appointed  COO adding to his Chief Product Officer role. “We want Greg to help us stay aligned and effective as we  grow so quickly around the world,” said Hastings.  Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast  In Q2, revenue grew 25% year over year, while quarterly operating income exceeded $1 billion. Average  streaming paid memberships in Q2 rose 25% year over year while streaming ARPU increased 0.4% year  over year. Excluding a -$289m impact from foreign exchange (F/X), streaming ARPU grew 5% year over  year. Operating margin expanded 770 basis points year over year to 22.1%, above our guidance forecast  due to higher than expected membership and revenue growth. In addition, content and marketing  expenses were lower than we expected, as the pandemic delayed some planned spend. EPS of $1.59 vs.  $0.60 a year ago included a $119m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro  denominated debt and a $220m non-cash valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (due to recent  legislation limiting the use of California R&D credits). Our Q2 effective tax rate of 30.5% includes about a  21% point negative impact due to the valuation allowance.   We added a Q2-record 10.1m paid memberships vs. 2.7m in last year’s Q2. The positive variance relative  to our 7.5m forecast was due to better-than-forecast acquisition and retention. In the first half of this  year, we’ve added 26m paid memberships, nearly on par with the 28m we achieved in all of 2019.  However, as we expected (and can be seen in the graph below), growth is slowing as consumers get  through the initial shock of Covid and social restrictions. Our paid net additions for the month of June  also included the subscriptions we \\u200bcancelled\\u200b for the small percentage of members who had not used the  service recently.      2  The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for  accuracy. We forecast 2.5m paid net adds for Q3’20 vs. 6.8m in the prior year quarter. As we indicated in  our Q1’20 letter, we’re expecting paid net adds will be down year over year in the second half as our  strong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year. In  addition, Q3’19 included the positive impact of new seasons of both \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b and \\u200bLa Casa de  Papel (\\u200baka\\u200b Money Heist)\\u200b. We continue to view the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not  that meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment which we believe  provides us with many years of strong growth ahead.   For the full year 2020, we’re still targeting a 16% operating margin. We’re currently on track to exceed  16% although F/X (and the relative strength of the US dollar) remains a wildcard. As always, our  intention is to grow our annual operating margin year over year - we’re currently targeting 19% for  2021.  Content  As the world slowly re-opens, our main business priority is to restart our productions safely and in a  manner consistent with local health and safety standards to ensure that our members can enjoy a  diverse range of high quality new content. Given the significant differences between countries (e.g.,  incidence of new Covid-19 cases, availability of testing, government and industry regulations), there is  no one-size-fits-all approach, and we’re adapting to local circumstances.   Today, we’re slowly resuming productions in many parts of the world. We are furthest along in Asia  Pacific (where we never fully shut down in Korea, for example) and are now shooting live action series  like season 2 of our Japanese original \\u200bThe Naked Director\\u200b. In EMEA, we are now back in production in  many countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Italy, and the UK. While we recently resumed  production on two films in California and two stop-motion animation projects in Oregon and expect  some more of our US productions to get going this quarter, current infection trends create more  uncertainty for our productions in the US. Parts of the world like India and some of Latin America are  also more challenging and we are hoping to restart later in the year in these regions.  Since our content production lead time is long, our 2020 plans for launching original shows and films  continue to be largely intact. For 2021, based on our current plan, we expect the paused productions  will lead to a more second half weighted content slate in terms of our big titles, although we anticipate  the total number of originals for the full year will still be higher than 2020. We’ll also round out our  content offering with film acquisitions like \\u200bThe Trial of the Chicago 7\\u200b from Aaron Sorkin and \\u200bThe  Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run\\u200b (global excluding US and China). We also acquired nearly  completed seasons of unreleased original series like \\u200bCobra Kai \\u200b(seasons 1, 2 and a brand new season 3)  and \\u200bEmily in Paris \\u200bstarring Lily Collins.   The pandemic and pauses in production are impacting our competitors and suppliers similarly. With our  large library of thousands of titles and strong recommendations, we believe our member satisfaction  will remain high.  3  In Q2, we notched successes in many of our key content verticals. In English scripted TV, \\u200bNever Have I  Ever\\u200b, a fun, young adult dramedy from Mindy Kaling, broke through with 40m households choosing to  watch this show in its first four weeks, and 40m households for our new comedy \\u200bSpace Force\\u200b (starring  Steve Carell). On the heels of \\u200bLove is Blind\\u200b, \\u200bToo Hot to Handle\\u200b and \\u200bFloor is Lava\\u200b are the latest in our line  of buzzy unscripted shows (51m and a projected 37m households, respectively, in the first four weeks).   In original films, 27 million households chose to watch Spike Lee’s \\u200bDa 5 Bloods\\u200b, which was celebrated as  a “\\u200bsoul stirring film for the ages\\u200b.” \\u200bExtraction\\u200b (starring Chris Hemsworth) and \\u200bThe Wrong Missy\\u200b, a comedy  starring David Spade and Lauren Lapkus, were also big hits with audiences (99m and 59m households,  respectively, chose to watch in their first 28 days). In addition, \\u200bThe Willoughbys\\u200b (38m households in the  first four weeks) is an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster  our offering for kids and families.   We also saw increased viewing for some older titles like \\u200b13th\\u200b, \\u200bAmerican Son\\u200b and \\u200bDear White People\\u200b - all  part of our \\u200bBlack Lives Matter Collection\\u200b - as our members sought out stories that speak to racial  injustice and the Black experience in America.   Our local language originals - like \\u200bDark\\u200b in Germany, \\u200bControl Z\\u200b in Mexico, \\u200bExtracurricular\\u200b in Korea, \\u200bThe  Woods\\u200b in Poland, or \\u200bBlood & Water\\u200b in South Africa - continue to be highly impactful, driving large  viewing, buzz and sign-ups in their home countries. We continue to see these stories find audiences all  over the world. The best example of this was \\u200bLa Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist): Part 4\\u200b, which we  launched on April 3; through its first 28 days, 65m households chose to watch this hit show.   For Q3, we recently released \\u200bThe Old Guard\\u200b (starring Charlize Theron), which continues our recent string  of adrenaline-filled action movies. Later in July, we’re looking forward to launching season 2 of \\u200bThe  Umbrella Academy\\u200b, followed by \\u200bThe Kissing Booth 2\\u200b (the sequel to our hit romantic comedy), \\u200bProject  Power\\u200b (an action movie starring Jamie Foxx) and \\u200bEnola Holmes\\u200b (featuring Millie Bobbie Brown as the  sister of Sherlock Holmes, played by Henry Cavill) later in the quarter.  Product and Partnerships  We continue to test different pricing approaches in some countries including lower priced, mobile-only  plans and our bundled offerings with MVPDs and ISPs. While some of these carry lower ARPU, the goal is  to accelerate membership growth on neutral-to-better short term revenue (with incremental acquisition  and improved retention offsetting the lower price). We think this strategy will increase long term  revenue as a larger membership base can generate more word-of-mouth around our content and help  us better understand peoples’ needs in that country - so that we can more quickly improve our catalog  and product experience, which would then lead to higher member satisfaction and growth as well as  improved long term retention.   A very small percentage of our members have not watched anything for the last two years and although  we make it easy for people to cancel their subscriptions with just a few clicks, they have not taken  advantage of that ability. So we decided to stop billing them and will do so for members meeting the  same criteria going forward. Like all of our former members, they can easily restart their membership in  the future. While this change resulted in a slight hit to revenue, we believe that pro-consumer policies  4  like this are the right thing to do and that the long term benefits will outweigh the short term costs. In a  world where consumers have many subscriptions, auto-pause on billing after an extended period of  non-use should be how leading services operate.   Competition  All of the major entertainment companies like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal are pushing their  own streaming services and two of the most valuable companies in the world, Apple and Amazon, are  growing their investment in premium content. In addition, TikTok’s growth is astounding, showing the  fluidity of internet entertainment. Instead of worrying about all these competitors, we continue to stick  to our strategy of trying to improve our service and content every quarter faster than our peers. Our  continued strong growth is a testament to this approach and the size of the entertainment market.   Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Net cash generated in operating activities in Q2 was +$1 billion vs. -$544 million in the prior year period.  Free cash flow  was positive for a second consecutive quarter at +$899m vs. -$594 million. Free cash  1 flow was higher than net income due primarily to the loss on FX remeasurement and the valuation  allowance for deferred tax assets, both of which were non-cash items that reduced net income.   Our FCF profile is continuing to improve, which is being driven in part by our growing operating margin  and the digestion of our big move into the production of Netflix originals that requires more cash  upfront vs. licensed content. In addition, the pause in production has also pushed out cash spending on  content into the second half of 2020 and into 2021.  Due to the pause in production from the pandemic combined with higher-than-forecast paid net adds  year to date, we now expect free cash flow for the full year 2020 to be breakeven to positive, compared  with our prior expectation for -$1 billion or better. As we indicated last quarter, in 2021 we project that  full year free cash flow will dip back to being negative again, although we believe the FCF deficit will be  materially better than our peak deficit level of -$3.3 billion in 2019. There has been no material change  in our overall estimated timetable to reach consistent annual positive FCF within the next few years.   We’re often asked by investors what our FCF profile would be at “steady state” or when our cash  content spending matches our content amortization. The pandemic and the resulting pause in  productions provides one early snapshot of what that may look like. In Q2’20, our cash spending on  content was $2.6 billion, equivalent to our content amortization of $2.6 billion, or a 1x cash  content-to-content amortization ratio . This resulted in a FCF margin of +15% in Q2. Of course, our plan  2 is to continue to grow our content spend (as we don’t believe we are anywhere near maturity), but the  above analysis may prove illustrative. And by the time our cash content-to-content amortization ratio  1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer  to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes  thereto.  2 For additional details on these concepts, please refer to our Content Accounting Overview slide deck on  our investor relations \\u200bsite\\u200b.  5  reaches 1x on a sustained basis (which is still many years away), we hope to have many more members  and much greater revenue, operating margin and FCF.   In April, we raised $1 billion of debt at a blended rate of ~3.3% across both US dollar and Euro tranches.  We ended Q2 with more than $7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.   As part of our commitment to racial equity, we allocated about two percent of our cash holdings -  initially up to $100 million - into financial institutions and organizations that directly \\u200bsupport Black  communities\\u200b in the US. We hope other US large-caps will also consider taking this small and relatively  easy step to bolster US racial economic equity.   With our cash balance, $750 million credit facility (which remains undrawn) and improving FCF profile,  we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for over 12 months. As a result, we don’t expect to  access the debt markets for the remainder of 2020 and we believe our need for external financing is  diminishing.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.  Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding future content offerings and the timing of such offerings,  including the uncertainty introduced by the Coronavirus pandemic; restarting productions; watch  metrics for certain titles; product tests, including those around pricing, and the anticipated impact of  such tests; impact of competition; future capital raises and external financing needs; global streaming  paid members, paid net additions and membership growth; paid net additions, consolidated revenue,  revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and free cash  flow, including future free cash flow profile and margin. The forward-looking statements in this letter  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including,  without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to  compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in  consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks, including those related to the  Coronavirus pandemic; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2020, as updated  in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

       " 'FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter': 'In Q2, revenue increased 19% year over year to $7.3 billion, while operating income rose 36% year over year to $1.8 billion. We finished the quarter with over 209m paid memberships, slightly ahead of our forecast. COVID has created some lumpiness in our membership growth (higher growth in 2020, slower growth this year), which is working its way through. We continue to focus on improving our service for our members and bringing them the best stories from around the world. Our summary results and forecast for Q3 are below. Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast Revenue growth was driven by an 11% increase in average paid streaming memberships and 8% growth in average revenue per membership (ARM) . ARM rose 4%, excluding a foreign exchange (FX) impact of 1 +$277m. Operating margin of 25.2% expanded 3 percentage points compared with the year ago quarter. EPS of $2.97 vs. $1.59 a year ago included a $63m non-cash unrealized loss from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. The pandemic has created unusual choppiness in our growth and distorts year-over-year comparisons as acquisition and engagement per member household spiked in the early months of COVID. In Q2’21, our engagement per member household was, as expected, down vs. those unprecedented levels but was still up 17% compared with a more comparable Q2’19. Similarly, retention continues to be strong and better than pre-COVID Q2’19 levels, even as average revenue per membership has grown 8% over this two-year 1 Average revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 period, demonstrating how much our members value Netflix and that as we improve our service we can charge a bit more. We added 1.5m paid memberships in Q2, slightly ahead of our 1.0m guidance forecast. The APAC region represented about two-thirds of our global paid net adds in the quarter. As expected, Q2 paid memberships in the UCAN region were slightly down sequentially (-0.4m paid net adds). We believe our large membership base in UCAN coupled with a seasonally smaller quarter for acquisition is the main reason for this dynamic. This is similar to what we experienced in Q2’19 when our UCAN paid net adds were -0.1m; since then we’ve added nearly 7.5m paid net adds in UCAN. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For Q3’21, we forecast paid net additions of 3.5m vs. 2.2m in the prior year period. If we achieve our forecast, we will have added more than 54m paid net adds over the past 24 months or 27m on an annualized basis over that time period, which is consistent with our pre-COVID annual rate of net additions. We forecast that ARM will grow roughly 5% year over year on a FX neutral basis in Q3’21. We continue to target a 20% operating margin for the full year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. After our big global launch in January 2016, we committed to steadily growing our operating margin thereafter at an average rate of three percentage points per year over any few-year period. Some years we’ll be a little over (like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021). Assuming we achieve our margin target this year, we will have quintupled our operating margin in the last five years and are tracking ahead of this average annual three percentage point pace. 2 With revenue and margin both increasing, our operating profit dollars have risen dramatically as well (even as we have been investing heavily), from about $100 million per quarter in 2016 to nearly $2 billion per quarter so far in 2021. Our belief is that as we steadily improve our service to better please our members, this will lead to continued growth in our membership base, ARM, revenue, operating margin and profit dollars. Content We launched our first original scripted TV series in 2012 and we’ve since expanded our original programming effort to many additional categories, from all over the world. Our goal is to be everyone’s first choice for entertainment because of the variety and quality of our titles. And despite the COVID-related production delays in 2020, we were able to deliver an exciting portfolio of titles in Q2’21 that exemplify this ambition. For example, Shadow and Bone, a fantasy series based on the popular Grishaverse book series, proved to be very popular with our members. Over 55m member households chose to watch this show in its first 28 days and we’ve renewed it for a second season. Sweet Tooth, based on the beloved DC comic, was another hit series with 60m member households choosing this title in its first four weeks. Our expansion into non-fiction series is going well. This past quarter, standout unscripted titles include season two of dating show Too Hot to Handle and social experiment reality program The Circle (an estimated 29m and 14m, respectively, chose to watch in the first 28 days) as well as the true crime docu-series The Sons of Sam (19m). We’re building out some of these unscripted titles with local versions of the same formats. As one example, Too Hot to Handle: Brazil and Too Hot to Handle: Latino will be launching later in July and September, respectively, to serve our LATAM region. 3 We’re also quickly growing both our live action and animated original film offering, with several impactful titles in Q2. Zack Snyder’s Army of the Dead was a blockbuster as 75m member households chose to watch this action packed zombie spectacle in its first 28 days of release. As an extension to Army of the Dead, a prequel, Army of Thieves, will be released in Q4’21 along with a spinoff anime series later in 2022. Fatherhood, a dramedy starring Kevin Hart, was another hit, drawing an estimated 74m member households in its first 28 days. And Q2 also featured our biggest Netflix animated film to date with 53m member households choosing to watch The Mitchells vs. The Machines. Last week, Netflix series and specials received 129 Emmy nominations. With 24 nominations, The Crown tied for the most nominated series. Bridgerton with 12 nominations was also nominated for Best Drama series while The Queen’s Gambit received 18 nominations including Best Limited Series. Cobra Kai, Emily In Paris and the finale season of The Kominsky Method were all nominated for Best Comedy series. Beyond this acclaim, these are also among our popular series on Netflix. Our non-English content investments are growing both in scope and impact. Our P&L content expense for this content category has more than doubled in the past two years. Illustrating how great stories can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere, part two of Lupin from France was our largest non-English title in the quarter with 54m member households choosing this title in its first four weeks. Season four of Elite from Spain drew 37m member households in its first 28 days, while season two of Who Killed Sara? built on the success of the first season with 34m households choosing the latest installment of this gripping thriller from Mexico. As discussed in previous letters, COVID-related production delays in 2020 have led to a lighter first half of 2021 slate that will build through the course of the year. In the first six months of 2021, content amortization grew only 9% year over year (as compared to 17% in FY20). COVID and its variants make predicting the future hard, but with productions largely running smoothly so far, we’re optimistic in our ability to deliver a strong second half slate. Through the first half of 2021 we’ve already spent $8 billion in cash on content (up 41% yr-over-yr and 1.4x our content amortization) and we expect content amortization to be around $12 billion for the full year (+12% year over year). Our Q3 slate will include new seasons of fan favorites La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), Sex Education, Virgin River and Never Have I Ever as well as live action films including Sweet Girl (starring Jason Momoa), Kissing Booth 3, and Kate (starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the animated feature film Vivo, featuring all-new songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda. We’re also in the early stages of further expanding into games, building on our earlier efforts around interactivity (eg, Black Mirror Bandersnatch) and our Stranger Things games. We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV. Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscription at no additional cost similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games for mobile devices. We’re excited as ever about our movies and TV series offering and we expect a long runway of increasing investment and growth across all of our existing content categories, but since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games. Product 4 We’re constantly innovating across a broad range of areas to improve the viewing experience and better serve our members. That’s why this quarter we globally launched Play Something on television, our new feature that lets Netflix do the work when you don’t feel like choosing what to watch. Recognizing that broadband quality and cost varies around the world, we also improved the Netflix download experience to enable you to start watching a show or film even if it hasn’t finished downloading. Once you reconnect, you can complete the partial download and keep watching — also helping members avoid exceeding their data limits. We recently expanded our low-cost mobile-only plan to an additional 78 countries across South East Asia and sub-saharan Africa. Like in our other markets, this plan complements our existing three tiers of service. In the five markets where we had previously launched a mobile-only plan, we have found that the mobile only plan has been an effective way to introduce more consumers to Netflix while being roughly revenue neutral as the lower average revenue per membership is offset by incremental acquisition and generally better retention. Competition We are still very much in the early days of the transition from linear to on-demand consumption of entertainment. Streaming represents just 27% of US TV screen time, compared with 63% for linear television, according to Nielsen. Based on this same study, Nielsen estimates that we are just 7% of US TV screen time. Considering that we are less mature in other countries and that this excludes mobile screens (where we believe our share of engagement is even lower), we are confident that we have a long runway for growth. As we improve our service, our goal is to continue to increase our share of screen time in the US and around the world. 5 Share of Total US TV Time, June 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) The planned combination of Warner Media Group and Discovery and Amazon’s pending acquisition of MGM are examples of the ongoing industry consolidation as firms adapt to a world where streaming supplants linear TV. The industry has consolidated materially over the years (Time Warner/AT&T, Viacom/CBS, Discovery/Scripps, Disney/Fox, Comcast/NBCU/Sky, etc.) and we don’t believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if at all. While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as “must-have” and we haven’t yet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon. In the race to entertain consumers around the world, we continue to compete for screen time with a broad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok (to name just a few). But, we are mostly competing with ourselves to improve our service as fast as we can. If we can do that, we’re confident we can maintain our strong position and continue to grow nicely as we have been over the past two-plus decades. Cash Flow and Capital Structure In Q2, net cash generated by operating activities was -$64 million vs. $1 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was -$175 million vs. $899 million in Q2‘20. FCF in last year’s 2 Q2 benefited from COVID-related production shutdowns. We are still expecting full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately break even. As we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6 During Q2, we increased our revolving credit facility (which remains undrawn) to $1 billion from $750 million and extended the maturity from 2024 to 2026. We also repurchased 1m shares for $500 million (at an average per share price of about $500) under our $5 billion share authorization. Our main priority is to invest in the organic growth of our business while maintaining strong liquidity and retaining financial flexibility for strategic investments. Our growing operating profit allows us to complement this priority with a return of capital to shareholders. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In June, the independent sustainability think tank The Carbon Trust published a white paper examining the carbon impact of video streaming. Key findings of the work include:  The average carbon footprint for Europe per hour of video streaming is approximately 55gCO2e, equivalent to driving 250 metres in an average petrol car.  Devices (TVs, laptops/PCs, smartphones, tablets) make up the largest portion of carbon emissions from streaming (over 50%), compared to other components like energy from data centers or networks. Good news: Devices are getting more efficient over time and total device usage is fairly constant (with Netflix gaining share from linear).  Changing resolutions and other viewing settings were found to result in only a very small change in the carbon impact. Changing from standard definition to 4K resolution grows transmission emissions from just under 1g CO2e/hour to just over 1g CO2e/hour.  As demand for streaming and other internet services increases, the carbon intensity of these services will decrease over time. This is due to (1) networking equipment becoming less energy-intensive with technological advances, and (2) increased use of renewable electricity.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q2-22-Shareholder-Letter': 'Q2 was better-than-expected on membership growth, and foreign exchange was worse-than-expected (stronger US dollar), resulting in 9% revenue growth (13% constant currency). Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product, content, and marketing as we’ve done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience. We’re in a position of strength given our $30 billion-plus in revenue, $6 billion in operating profit last year, growing free cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q2 Results Revenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year (or 13% excluding a -$339 million foreign currency impact), driven by a 6% and 2% increase in average paid memberships and ARM , respectively. Excluding the impact of 1 foreign exchange (F/X), ARM rose 7% year over year. The appreciation of the US dollar (USD) vs. most other currencies since our April earnings report was the primary reason for the variance to our revenue guidance forecast. We slightly under-forecasted global paid net adds in Q2 (-1.0m vs. -2.0m forecast and compared to +1.5m in the year ago quarter).  In APAC, revenue grew 23% year over year, excluding F/X. At over $900 million of revenue, APAC is approaching the size of our LATAM business. We added 1.1m paid memberships in the region (vs. 1.0m last Q2). ARM in APAC was -2% year over year on a F/X neutral basis, due to the impact from our price decrease in India last December as well as plan mix, which was partially offset by 1 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 higher ARM in Korea and Australia. Excluding India, APAC ARM grew 4% year over year on a constant currency basis.  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM increased 13% and 6% year over year, respectively, while paid net additions totaled -0.8m vs. 0.2m in the year ago quarter.  Revenue in LATAM grew 19% year over year excluding F/X and surpassed the $1 billion quarterly mark for the first time, helped by constant currency ARM growth of 15%. Paid memberships were flat sequentially (compared to 0.8m paid net adds in Q2’21).  In UCAN, ARM and revenue each increased 10% year over year, excluding the impact of F/X. Paid net adds were -1.3m vs. -0.4m in the year ago period. Retention improved over the course of the quarter and, while churn remains slightly elevated, it is now back near pre-price change levels. We’ve adjusted our cost structure for our current rate of revenue growth. This resulted in approximately $70 million of severance costs and an $80m non-cash impairment of certain real estate leases primarily related to rightsizing our office footprint. Excluding these items totaling $150 million, and the F/X impact of the stronger US dollar since our April report, operating profit and operating margin were slightly ahead of our guidance forecast. EPS of $3.20 vs. $2.97 a year ago exceeded our guidance forecast of $3.00 due to a $305 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” Our approximately $5 billion of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge against the Euro for net income, but doesn’t affect operating income. Year to date, our gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro debt is $467 million. Q3 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the current uncertain macro-economic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. The US dollar continues to strengthen meaningfully against most currencies at a historic pace, with the Euro recently falling below the US dollar for the first time in two decades, a significant headwind for all multinational US companies. We have high exposure to this unprecedented appreciation in the USD because nearly 60% of our revenue comes from outside the US and swings in F/X have a large flow through to operating profit as most of our expenses are in USD and don’t benefit from a stronger USD. Our Q3 revenue growth forecast of 5% translates into 12% year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Similarly, excluding the impact of currency, operating profit growth would be -3% year over year (vs our forecast decline of -29%) and operating margin would be 20% (vs our forecast of 16%). As we have written in the past, over the medium term, we intend to continue to adjust our business as appropriate given the relative strength of the USD to protect our operating margin and try to avoid immediate actions that we believe could be detrimental to the business. We forecast paid net adds for Q3 of +1.0m vs. 4.4m in the year ago quarter. We continue to expect full year 2022 operating margin of 19%-20%, excluding the unanticipated $150m of restructuring costs in Q2 2 noted above and the material movement in F/X from January 2022, as our guidance was set based on F/X at that time (see our Q4’21 letter). Content, Marketing, and Product Last quarter, we discussed our slowing revenue growth, which we believe is the result of connected TV adoption, account sharing, competition, and macro factors such as sluggish economic growth and the impacts of the war in Ukraine. We’ve now had more time to understand these issues, as well as how best to address them. First and foremost, we need to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix. This focus on improving our core service has served us well over the past 25 years, and remains our north star to drive continuous growth. It’s why we strive for an ever better content, marketing and product experience. Also as a pure play streaming business, we’re unencumbered by legacy revenue streams. This freedom means we can offer big movies direct-to-Netflix, without the need for extended or exclusive theatrical windows, and let members binge watch TV if they want, without having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. This focus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believe to be a significant long term business advantage. Our content offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of member tastes by providing an unmatched variety and quality of titles. Our Q2 slate is emblematic of this approach, headlined by season four of Stranger Things, which returned to tremendous fan reception and was a smash hit by all measures - including an outstanding drama Emmy nomination (along with Ozark season 4 and Squid Game). In its first four weeks, Stranger Things season four generated 1.3 billion hours viewed , making it our biggest 2 season of English TV ever. Season four also re-ignited interest in past episodes with season one through three experiencing a greater than five-fold increase in viewing in the month after the release of season four (vs. the prior month). Season four of Stranger Things also showcased the effectiveness of our marketing strategy in driving conversation around our titles. When we deliver shows and movies that members are talking about in large numbers, we can influence pop culture, build passion for Netflix and create an experience that is differentiated and difficult-to-replicate. For example, the show catapulted the 1985 song Running Up That Hill to the top of the music charts. Metallica also enjoyed a return to the charts in the US and UK with their 1986 song Master of Puppets after being featured in the new season of Stranger Things. The cumulative Twitter volume for Stranger Things continues to outpace both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Top Gun Maverick, highlighting the big conversation around this title and reinforcing that our binge versus one week at a time release strategy drives lots of “water cooler conversation.” 2 Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release for each title; since some titles have multiple premiere dates, whether weekly or in parts, we count the 28 days from each episode premiere date in each country. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 17, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed at Netflix Top 10. 3 We also delivered a wide variety of other English language series hits in Q2, including season three of The Umbrella Academy (284m view hours*) and season one of The Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama, which generated 277m hours viewed and has been renewed for a second season. We’ve also renewed the endearing, UK-produced young adult drama Heartstopper (67m view hours) for another two seasons. In unscripted, audiences embraced season five of Selling Sunset, which recorded 95m view hours in its first four weeks, while the debut season of marriage reality show The Ultimatum had 148m view hours. In unscripted, we are also taking global formats and creating local versions. This quarter, we had Rhythm + Flow France, our rap competition show, which was a big local success. The winner of season one, Fresh, was formerly unknown, working in a gym. But since his appearance on the show, he has become a star with his song CHOP that he performed in the finale hitting #1 on every streaming service in France. He was also invited to the Les Ardentes music festival where he performed for an audience of 15,000 people - another example of \"The Netflix Effect.\" We’re making good progress in film. The basketball drama Hustle (starring Adam Sandler) was our biggest Netflix movie in Q2 (186m hours viewed) and was loved by critics and audiences alike, followed by the comedy Senior Year, starring Rebel Wilson, with 161m view hours. We continue to invest in animated features; building off our initial titles like Over the Moon and Back to the Outback, we released The Sea Beast (102m hours viewed*) early in Q3 to audience and critical acclaim. Today, we announced that we will be acquiring leading animation studio Animal Logic, with ~800 amazing people mostly in Sydney and Vancouver, which will help us accelerate the development of our animation production capabilities and reinforces our commitment to build a world-class animation studio. We’ve been partnering with Animal Logic for two years now, working on The Magician’s Elephant (directed by Wendy Rogers) and the recently announced The Shrinking of the Treehorns (directed by Ron Howard). Together, we’ll create an animation studio that will produce some of our largest animated 4 feature films. We’ll fund the purchase from our existing cash balance. The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals and we anticipate closing later this year. We’re building on our lead in non-English programming. We want Netflix to be relevant to audiences all over the globe and our local language titles are a differentiator for us. We focus first on telling authentic stories for local impact, but we see that great stories can travel everywhere. Another example of this In Q2 was The Marked Heart, a Colombian series, which found a global audience and ended up in the top 10 in 81 countries around the world by its second week.  Similarly, The Takedown, a French film, was in the top 10 in 91 countries around the world by its second week, again showing the power of an authentic story and our ability to serve those stories - with subtitling, dubbing, and personalized discovery - for members to enjoy around the world. While we always have room to improve, we’re very pleased with how far we’ve come in providing so much satisfaction and enjoyment to our members. For instance, in the US, which is one of the most competitive markets in the world, we drew more TV viewing time than any other outlet during the 2021-22 TV season (see chart below), nearly matching the combined total of the two most watched broadcast networks. And, as Nielsen will announce on Thursday, our share of US TV viewing reached an all-time high of 7.7% in June (vs. 6.6% in June 2021), demonstrating our ability to grow our engagement share as we continue to improve our service. Since our launch of a small selection of licensed mobile games last November, we’ve released new games every few weeks, with the portfolio growing to the current total of 24. The games are all intended to be accessible to broad audiences, and span several genres and categories, including racing with Asphalt Xtreme, the digital version of the irreverent card game Exploding Kittens, zombies in Into the Dead 2 and the knitting for cats in Knittens. We’ve had millions of our members play games through the service and we are learning about what games work for different audiences. We’re adapting our 5 licensing and partner-based development activities in response to these learnings. We’ve also acquired three games studios (Night School Studios, Boss Fight Studios, and Next Games) which gives us a range of expertise in multiple geographies to accelerate the buildout of our internal development capacity. We are building a solid pipeline of new games that will launch over the next several years and are excited to see our members engage with these titles. Near Term Focus In the near term, a key priority to re-accelerate revenue growth is to evolve and improve our monetization. In the early days of streaming, we kept our pricing very simple with just one plan level. In 2014, we introduced three price tiers to better segment demand. Going forward, we will focus on better monetizing usage through both continued optimization of our pricing and tiering structures as well as the addition of a new, lower-priced ad-supported tier. Advertising Our lower priced advertising-supported offering will complement our existing plans, which will remain ad-free. Our global ARM has grown at a 5% compound annual rate from 2013 to 2021, so it makes sense now to give consumers a choice for a lower priced option with advertisements, if they desire it. We recently announced Microsoft as our technology and sales partner and we’re targeting to launch this tier around the early part of 2023. They are investing heavily to expand their multi-billion advertising business into premium television video, and we are thrilled to be working with such a strong global partner. We’re excited by the opportunity given the combination of our very engaged audience and high quality content, which we think will attract premium CPMs from brand advertisers. We’ll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant. Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So, our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one. Over time, our hope is to create a better-than-linear-TV advertisement model that’s more seamless and relevant for consumers, and more effective for our advertising partners. While it will take some time to grow our member base for the ad tier and the associated ad revenues, over the long run, we think advertising can enable substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth (through ad revenues). Paid Sharing We’re in the early stages of working to monetize the 100m+ households that are currently enjoying, but not directly paying for, Netflix. We know this will be a change for our members. As such, we have launched two different approaches in Latin America to learn more. Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023. We’re encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America. 6 Simplicity At Netflix, focus remains very important to us. These initiatives - paid sharing and advertising - do introduce some additional complexity, but our approach has always been to keep our business model as simple as possible within the context of our growth objectives. In this vein, these initiatives are similar to expanding into originals, launching our service across the world, and building our own studio, each of which also increased complexity but are natural extensions intended to enhance our existing business. F/X Neutral Operating Margin Disclosure To provide additional transparency around our operating margin, we’ll now disclose our year-to-date (YTD) operating margin based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year.  This will allow investors to see how our operating margin is tracking against our target (which was set in January of 2022 based on F/X rates at that time), absent intra-year fluctuations in F/X (which have been substantial in 2022). As can be seen from the table below, F/X-driven changes to our revenue have a high flow through to operating income (the operating profit impact ranges from ~75% to 80%+ of the revenue impact). This is because the bulk of our expenses don’t change with F/X fluctuations. * Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year. YTD 2022 through June 30, 2022. Note: There were no adjustments to content amortization for the purposes of this calculation, as titles are amortized at the historical blended rate at the time of capitalization. 7 Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was +$103 million vs. -$64 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) in the quarter totaled +$13 million, compared with  -$175 million in Q2’21. 3 Cash declined $190m sequentially, primarily due to our Next Games acquisition ($69m) and the F/X impact on cash ($145m). As we’ve discussed previously, we are now self-funding. For the full year 2022, we expect FCF to be approximately +$1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars (assuming no material further movements in F/X). We expect annual positive FCF going forward (with substantial growth in FCF in 2023 vs. 2022) due to our increasing revenue, solid profitability, and the successful multi-year evolution of our content model. We’re now more than a decade into transforming our service from licensed second run content to mostly Netflix originals - including more than five years into building out our internal studio to produce the majority of our original titles (60% of our net content assets on our balance sheet are Netflix-produced). We’re now through the most cash-intensive part of that transition. As a result, our cash content spend-to-content amortization expense ratio peaked at 1.6x (along with peak negative FCF of -$3.3B in 2019) and is expected to be about 1.2-1.3x in 2022 and to decline going forward, based on our current plans, which assume no material expansion into new content categories in ‘23. 2022 estimate based on the midpoint of 1.2x-1.3x range. 3 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 8 Gross debt at quarter end amounted to $14.3 billion, within our targeted range of $10-$15 billion. With cash of $5.8 billion, net debt totaled $8.5 billion, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA . Our capital structure policy 4 remains unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (eg, about $5.3 billion based on Q2 revenue). After meeting those needs, our intent is to return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) At this year’s annual meeting in June, shareholders approved proposals to declassify our board, remove supermajority voting provisions in our charter and enable shareholders to call special meetings. We’ve also changed the voting standard for our directors to simple majority in uncontested elections. Our governance structure is now similar to other large cap company governance structures. With more than one billion people living with some form of disability, we want to ensure Netflix is as accessible as possible. In Q2, we announced that we are expanding the availability of audio descriptions and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing to a total of 20 languages - work that recently won the prestigious Dr. Jacob Bolotin Award. We’ve also introduced new badges for our titles that have audio descriptions and subtitles on laptop and iOS, eliminating the inconvenient need to play a title first. Summary Reaccelerating our revenue growth is a big challenge. But we’ve been through hard times before. We’ve built this company to be flexible and adaptable and this will be a great test for us and our high performance culture. We’re fortunate to be in a position of strength as the leader in streaming entertainment by all metrics (revenue, engagement, subscribers, profit and free cash flow). We’re confident and optimistic about the future.

Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F/X neutral operating margin allows investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currency fluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q2-23-Shareholder-Letter': 'In May, we successfully launched paid sharing in 100+ countries, representing more than 80% of our revenue base. ○ Revenue in each region is now higher than pre-launch, with sign-ups already exceeding cancellations. ○ Paid net additions were 5.9M in Q2, and today we’re rolling out paid sharing to almost all of the remaining countries.  Q2‘23 revenue of $8.2B and operating profit of $1.8B were generally in-line with our forecast—and we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of ‘23 as we start to see the full benefits of paid sharing plus continued steady growth in our ad-supported plan. We’re still targeting a full year 2023 operating margin of 18% to 20%.  We’re a leader in terms of streaming engagement and, per Nielsen, we had the top original streaming series in the US for 24 of the first 25 weeks of 2023, and the top movie for 21 weeks. While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth. We remain focused on: creating a steady drumbeat of must watch shows and movies; improving monetization; growing the enjoyment of our games; and investing to improve our service for members. (in millions except per share data) Q2\\'22 Q3\\'22 Q4\\'22 Q1\\'23 Q2\\'23 Q3\\'23 Forecast Revenue $7,970 $7,926 $7,852 $8,162 $8,187 $8,520 Y/Y % Growth 8.6% 5.9% 1.9% 3.7% 2.7% 7.5% Operating Income $1,578 $1,533 $550 $1,714 $1,827 $1,890 Operating Margin 19.8% 19.3% 7.0% 21.0% 22.3% 22.2% Net Income $1,441 $1,398 $55 $1,305 $1,488 $1,580 Diluted EPS $3.20 $3.10 $0.12 $2.88 $3.29 $3.52 Global Streaming Paid Memberships 220.67 223.09 230.75 232.50 238.39 Y/Y % Growth 5.5% 4.5% 4.0% 4.9% 8.0% Global Streaming Paid Net Additions -0.97 2.41 7.66 1.75 5.89 Net cash provided by operating activities $103 $557 $444 $2,179 $1,440 Free Cash Flow $13 $472 $332 $2,117 $1,339 Shares (FD) 450.2 450.3 451.6 452.4 451.6 1 Q2 Results Revenue in Q2 grew 3% year over year (+6% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis ). Revenue growth 1 was driven by a 6% increase in average paid membership, while ARM declined 3% year over year (-1% 2 F/X neutral). The year-over-year ARM decline was driven by a combination of limited price increases over the past 12 months (leading up to the launch of paid sharing), timing of paid net additions (primarily late in the quarter due to the May 23 rollout of paid sharing in Q2), and a higher mix of membership growth from lower ARM countries. We had paid net additions of 5.9M for Q2’23 (with over 1M paid net adds in each region) vs. -1.0M in Q2’22 as we successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries (representing over 80% of our revenue). Q2 operating income totaled $1.8B, up 16% vs. $1.6B in the year ago quarter. Operating margin was 22%, compared with 20% in Q2’22. Both were slightly ahead of our beginning-of-quarter forecast due to ongoing expense management, slower-than-projected headcount growth and timing of content spend. EPS in Q2 amounted to $3.29 vs. $3.20 in Q2’22 and included a $29 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in “interest and other income/expense.” Forecast Our primary financial metrics are revenue for growth, and operating margin for profitability. Our goal is to accelerate revenue growth, expand our operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. Now that we’ve launched paid sharing broadly, we have increased confidence in our financial outlook. We expect revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of 2023 as monetization grows from our most recent paid sharing launch and we expand our initiative across nearly all remaining countries plus the continued steady growth in our ad-supported plan (more details in the Monetization and Revenue section). For Q3, we forecast revenue of $8.5B, up 7% year over year on both a reported and F/X neutral basis, a slight acceleration from our Q2’23 F/X neutral revenue growth rate of 6%. Our revenue growth in Q3 will come from growth in average paid memberships. We expect F/X neutral ARM to be flat to slightly down year over year, as we are lapping price increases in 2022 and we generally haven’t had price increases in our largest revenue markets since the first half of last year (limited during paid sharing rollout). Revenue from advertising and our extra member feature are not yet material enough to offset these factors. We 3 anticipate Q3’23 paid net adds will be similar to Q2’23 paid net additions. We expect that our revenue 3 As a reminder, extra member accounts are not included in our paid membership count but add revenue that is included in ARM. 2 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchange rate movements. Assumes foreign exchange rates remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. 2 growth will accelerate more substantially in Q4’23 as we further monetize account sharing between households and steadily grow our advertising revenue. We expect Q3 operating income of $1.9B vs. $1.5B in Q3’22 and operating margin of 22% compared with 19% in the year ago period. We’re still targeting a full year 2023 operating margin of 18%-20%, based on F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, up from 17.8% in FY22. Engagement We focus on engagement because it\\'s the best proxy we have for satisfaction. It’s also closely linked to retention, an important driver of our business. Key for Netflix members is the variety and quality of our content, with the understanding that quality is in the eye of the beholder. We’re often asked “what is a Netflix show?” The answer is one that super serves the audience, leaving them highly satisfied and excited for more. It’s the satirical dramedy Beef (starring Ali Wong and Steven Yeun) and the dating show Love is Blind S4 (both of which were in the Netflix Top 10 throughout April), the romance of Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story and the action of The Night Agent (both of which were in our top 10 throughout May)—stories that could not be more different and yet thrilled millions. The combination of content variety and personalization means that each person easily finds titles they will love. We learned the importance of variety back in the DVD days, and it’s become even more important with streaming. Because if you aspire to serve hundreds of millions of people all around the world, you can’t program for one set of tastes or sensibilities. You need to invest across genres, cultures and languages. Q2 was a good example of the range to which we aspire. Members could choose dramas like The Diplomat and Sanctuary (Japan), adrenaline-filled action with Arnold Schwarzenegger in FUBAR (followed by Arnold, a documentary about his life) and Fake Profile (Colombia), satire with Black Mirror, sports with the Tour de France: Unchained, romantic young adult comedy with XO Kitty (a TV spinoff from the To All Boys I’ve Loved Before film trilogy) or rap competition with Rhythm & Flow France S2. All these titles not only hit Netflix’s Top 10 list in their own country but also across multiple countries and our Global Top 10—showing that, with good subtitles and dubbing, plus easy discovery, great stories can truly come from anywhere and excite audiences everywhere. Even in the US, which has historically had incredibly local viewing habits, we’ve seen non-English language titles gain increasing popularity. Shows like Physical 100 (Korea), The Glory (Korea), Alice in Borderland (Japan), Marked Heart (Colombia), The Snow Girl (Spain) and Que Viva Mexico! (Mexico) and films such as Hunger (Thailand) and AKA (France) have all hit Nielsen’s weekly original streaming TV or film top 10 lists in the US for at least one week this year. As always, we strive for constant improvement and to increase the impact of our slate investments over time. Film is a good example of our steady progress, as our Q2 film slate demonstrated a consistent string of hits. We kicked off the quarter with Murder Mystery 2, featuring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston (114.3M views in its first three months). This was followed by the thriller The Mother* (starring 4 4 Views are based on the first 91 days of release. For titles released less than 91 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 16, 2023. We publish weekly our top titles based on engagement at Netflix Top 10. 3 Jennifer Lopez) in May, which spent six weeks atop our Top 10 weekly films list and has now become one of our most popular films of all time with 131.6 million views. We closed the quarter with the Chris Hemsworth-led action blockbuster Extraction 2*, which garnered 116.7M views in only 31 days. Murder Mystery 2 and Extraction 2 also sparked renewed interest in the original films, with both surging back into the Global Top 10 in Q2, several years after they first premiered on Netflix, highlighting the durability of these titles and talent. We see similar fandom on the TV side too. Bridgerton S1 reappeared in Netflix’s Top 10 in May when Queen Charlotte*—our latest story in the Bridgerton franchise—launched (79.6M views), Never Have I Ever S1 re-emerged in June when we premiered the fourth and final season of this beloved coming of age story and The Witcher S1 and S2 returned to our Top 10 in July as fans re-immerse themselves in the third season of this fantasy drama. This success demonstrates the progress we’ve made building lasting intellectual property (IP) from a standing start just a decade ago. This year we’ll have more returning seasons than any other streamer with The Crown, Top Boy, The Upshaws, Sweet Magnolias, Heartstopper, Virgin River, Too Hot To Handle and more still to come. In June, we evolved our Netflix Top 10, which provides weekly engagement data for our top shows and movies, across 93 countries. We continue to provide total hours viewed, but now rank titles by the number of views (i.e. total hours viewed divided by the runtime ). We think this new approach is more 5 intuitive and it also adjusts for runtime (i.e. longer films or series don’t get an inherent advantage). We’ve also extended our Most Popular lists of all time from 28 days to 91 days so people can see how great stories grow over time. We believe sharing this engagement data on a regular basis helps talent and the broader industry understand what success looks like on Netflix—and we hope that other streamers become more transparent about engagement on their services over time. Below is a consolidated list of our global Top 10 all-time most popular TV shows and movies based on views.6 We build on the success of our titles with marketing to fuel conversation, fandom and discovery (the thrill of the find). In June, we hosted our third annual fan event Tudum in person for the first time. Over 10,000 fans attended live in Brazil and the show generated 78M views across our social platforms, an 6 As of July 16 2023. 5 We’ll publish all three data sets - views, total hours viewed and runtime - each week. 4 86% year-over-year increase and up over 200% from 2021’s 25.7M. It’s inspiring to witness the passion that exists for our shows and films, something we believe truly sets Netflix apart. Monetization and Revenue In addition to delivering an ever-improving slate and product experience, we’ve been working to improve our monetization through initiatives like paid sharing and advertising. This will allow us to generate more revenue off a bigger base, which we can reinvest to make Netflix even better for our members. Advertising enables us to offer consumers a lower price point and, eight months post launch, we’re working hard to scale the business. Our key focus is improving the ads experience for both members and advertisers. In addition to now offering 95% content parity globally (by viewing), more streams plus improved video quality on our ads plan, we’re partnering with Nielsen and EDO to improve measurement and innovating for advertisers. Brands can also now target media buys on our Top 10, which is updated daily and enables them to connect with audiences during our biggest viewing moments. While we continue to grow our reach—ads plan membership has nearly doubled since Q1— it’s still off a small membership base, so current ad revenue isn’t material for Netflix. Building an ads business from scratch isn’t easy and we have lots of hard work ahead, but we’re confident that over time we can develop advertising into a multi-billion dollar incremental revenue stream. Increased sophistication on pricing and plans strategy is important to improved monetization. In Q1, we lowered prices in a number of less penetrated markets, and in Q2, we phased out our Basic ads-free plan for new and rejoining members in Canada (existing members on the Basic ads-free plan are unaffected). We’re now doing the same in the US and the UK. We believe our entry prices in these countries – $6.99 in the US, £4.99 in the UK and $5.99 in Canada – provide great value to consumers given the breadth and quality of our catalog. Tackling account sharing between households has been another focus as it undermines our ability to invest to improve Netflix for our paying members and grow our business. In May, we expanded paid sharing to 100+ countries, which account for over 80% of our revenue. The cancel reaction was low and while we’re still in the early stages of monetization, we’re seeing healthy conversion of borrower households into full paying Netflix memberships as well as the uptake of our extra member feature. We are revenue and paid membership positive vs. prior to the launch of paid sharing across every region in our latest launch. Beginning today, we’ll start to address account sharing between households in almost all of our remaining countries. In these markets, we’re not offering an extra member option given that we’ve recently cut prices in a good number of these countries (for example, Indonesia, Croatia, Kenya, and India) and penetration is still relatively low in many of them so we have plenty of runway without creating additional complexity. Households borrowing Netflix will be able to transfer existing profiles to new and existing accounts. 5 Competition Consumers have so many amazing entertainment choices — from movies and TV shows to sports and news to gaming and social media just to name a few. We expect that competition will remain intense, including within streaming. Our biggest traditional entertainment competitors, Disney, Comcast/NBCU, Paramount Global and Warner Brothers Discovery — with their large content libraries and creative expertise — are now focused on profit so they can build sustainable, long term streaming businesses. And our big tech competitors Apple, Amazon and YouTube — with their broad reach and deep pockets — continue to invest heavily to grow their streaming revenues. Netflix’s revenue was $32B in 2022, compared to nearly $40B for YouTube across all its products (trailing 12-month basis as of Q1’23) and 7 Amazon’s $35B subscription revenue in 2022, of which we assume the majority relates to the Prime bundle that includes shipping, video and other services. Combined with Apple’s video initiatives, there’s 8 quite a competitive battle happening. Nielsen’s The Gauge: Share of US TV Screen Time, Total Day, Persons 2+ But while streaming is intensely competitive, we’ve shown that with strong execution and focus, it can be a great business. Long term success takes strength in both entertainment and technology, a combination that’s not been required of large media or tech companies in the past. It’s about one’s ability to work with the best creators; to produce and license movies, TV shows and ultimately games across multiple genres and languages globally; to create a stellar discovery engine; to build great partnerships and payments systems; and to continually pierce the zeitgeist with consumer passion and fandom. Improving across all these areas is key to ensuring that Netflix continues to lead the streaming 8 We don’t know how much of Amazon’s subscription revenue is related to Prime, Prime Video, or other digital and non-AWS subscriptions. 7 Including YouTube Ads, Premium, Music, and TV. 6 pack in terms of engagement, revenue and profit over the long term. We have much more to do and we’re ready for the challenge. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was $1.4B vs. $0.1B in the prior year period. Free cash flow in Q2’23 amounted to $1.3B compared with about breakeven in the year ago quarter. Assuming no 9 material swings in F/X, we now anticipate at least $5B in FCF for 2023, up from our prior estimate of at least $3.5B. Our updated expectation reflects lower cash content spend in 2023 than we originally anticipated due to timing of production starts and the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While this may create some lumpiness in FCF from 2023 to 2024, we plan to deliver substantial positive FCF in 2024 (with a cash content spend to content amortization ratio of roughly 1.1x). We finished Q2 with gross debt of $14.5B (in-line with our $10B-$15B targeted range) and cash and short term investments of $8.6B. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8M shares for $645M. We now have $3.4B of capacity remaining under our $5B share buyback authorization. We’re currently running a bit above our targeted minimum cash level , so we expect to increase our stock repurchase activity in the 10 second half of 2023, assuming no material change in our business. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We aspire to entertain the world—and to do so sustainably and responsibly. In April, we published our 2022 Inclusion Report Update—sharing the progress we’ve made to increase representation within our company. The latest USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative study into diversity on and off camera in our US film and series from 2020 to 2021 shows improvements for women and people from underrepresented groups. We also continue to support the next generation of talent through our Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which has invested $29 million in more than 100 programs across 35 countries in the last two years. These updates on inclusion, along with updates on additional ESG initiatives, can be found in our fourth annual ESG report, which was published in June. We continue to make progress on meeting our climate targets through optimizing our energy use, then electrifying it and decarbonizing the rest to bring remaining emissions to zero. The report also shares how we have evolved our governance structure.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F/X neutral revenue and operating margin allow investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currency fluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. We are not able to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the exact amount or timing of the reconciling items, including property and equipment and change in other assets, and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our expected results for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023 and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023; adoption and growth of streaming entertainment; growth outlook and market opportunity; competitive position; core strategy and business model; content offerings; our games strategy; monetization through pricing and tiering structures, including paid sharing; ad-supported tier and its prospects; product features; our competitors’ performance; impact of foreign exchange rates; cash balance and spend; stock repurchases; paid net additions, membership growth and retention; engagement; consolidated revenue, revenue growth and ARM, operating income, operating margin, net income, content amortization, and earnings per share; climate targets; advertising; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively, including for consumer engagement with different modes of entertainment; timing and adoption of the ads plan and paid sharing; the impact of work stoppages; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; macroeconomic conditions and timing of content releases. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 26, 2023. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors 10 should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter. 11 Netflix,�Inc.�

       " 'FINAL-Q3-18-Shareholder-Letter': \"Fellow shareholders,    Our broad slate of original programming helped drive a solid quarter of growth with streaming revenue  increasing 36% year over year and global membership surpassing 130 million paid and 137 million total.  We’re thrilled to be growing internet entertainment across the globe.        1  Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Streaming revenue grew 36% year over year in Q3, as average paid membership increased 25% and ASP  rose 8%. International revenue included a -$90 million year over year impact from currency.  Excluding  the impact of F/X, international ASP rose 11% year over year and 2% sequentially.  Operating margin expanded 500 bps year over year to 12%. This exceeded our forecast of 10.5% due to  the timing of content and marketing spend, a portion of which moved into Q4. EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.29  last year included an $8 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond and  a $38 million tax benefit related to adjustments to the transition tax on the repatriation of foreign  earnings and the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets (both related to true-ups from the 2017  US tax reform).   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report and we  strive for accuracy in our forecast. This means in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low  relative to our guidance. This quarter, we under-forecasted memberships. Total net additions of 7.0m  (up 31% vs. 5.3m last year) was higher than our forecast of 5.0m, and represented a new Q3 record. The  variance relative to forecast was due to greater-than-expected acquisition globally, with strong growth  broadly across all our markets including Asia.   For Q4, we forecast paid net additions of 7.6m, and total net additions of 9.4m, up 15% and 13%  compared with 6.6m and 8.3m in Q4 last year. We’re still targeting operating margin to be at the lower  end of the 10%-11% range for the full year 2018.  This means that in Q4 we expect operating margin will  dip to 5% from 7.5% in the year ago quarter.  As we have written in previous letters, this sequential  decline in operating margin in the second half of 2018 is due to the timing of content spend and a higher  mix of original films in Q4’18 (film amortization is more accelerated than series amortization due to  more front-loaded viewing). We would have preferred our operating margin to have been a little  steadier over the course of the year, and we will target a little less quarterly variance next year in our  progress to our full year target of 13% (assuming no major FX moves).   Next quarter, we expect to reclassify certain personnel costs from G&A to Content and Marketing, and  from Technology & Development to Other Cost of Revenues. This change would reflect the ongoing  evolution of our business to include self-production of content. A growing number of employees are  becoming involved in developing content as we migrate to self-produce more of our content vs. only  licensing original and non-original content.  We expect to make the same change with marketing and  other tech employee costs to maintain consistency in approach.  The change would result in a  comprehensive view of our total spending on content and marketing. This reclassification would have no  impact on total operating expenses, operating profit or operating margin. If enacted, we will provide  quarterly pro-formas so investors will see the change cleanly.  Evolving to Paid Membership Focus  The chart below illustrates our weekly \\u200bpaid\\u200b net additions (on the right) and \\u200btotal\\u200b net additions (on the  left, which includes paid + free) over the last several years. Paid net adds are more steady, as total net  additions can be skewed by free trials of varying quality.  This skew adds noise to our membership  2  forecasts in a way that isn’t material to revenue or the business. In comparison, paid net adds are a  more reliable indicator of revenue growth.    Because growth in paid memberships is more steady, our forecast for paid net adds has been historically  more accurate than our total net adds forecast. For example in Q2’18, our paid net adds forecast was off  by 11% compared to a 17% variance for total net adds forecast. In addition, we are learning that no free  trial may result in greater revenue in some markets, so free trial count at the end of a quarter will likely  be a less insightful predictor of future growth than in the past.   As a result, starting with our earnings report in January 2019, we’ll only guide to paid memberships; a  year after that, in 2020, we’ll cease reporting on end-of-quarter free trial count. We will show the  weekly paid net adds graph, as above on the right, in each earnings letter going forward. We expect this  additional disclosure will be helpful to your understanding of our business, in particular, how steady our  paid membership growth is in the near term.   Content  We have three major categories of content: licensed non-first-window content such as \\u200bShameless\\u200b,  licensed original first-window content such as \\u200bOrange is the New Black \\u200b(owned and developed by  Lionsgate), and now owned original first-window content from the Netflix studio, such as \\u200bStranger  Things\\u200b. Within those categories there are lots of subdivisions and per-territory treatments, but those are  the big three buckets.   It was just two years ago when we began building the third category: a film and TV studio within Netflix.  Some of our notable owned-titles in addition to \\u200bStranger Things \\u200binclude\\u200b: Big Mouth, The Ranch\\u200b, \\u200bBright\\u200b,  Godless\\u200b, \\u200bThe Kissing Booth\\u200b, \\u200b3%\\u200b, \\u200bDark\\u200b, \\u200bSacred Games\\u200b and \\u200bNailed It\\u200b. In addition to reducing our reliance on  outside studios, this initiative provides us with greater control over the content we create (e.g., long  term global rights), the ability to strengthen title-brand-love and franchise value (like consumer  products) and potentially lower costs (as we can avoid the markup 3rd party studios charge us). To do  this, we’ve had to develop new capabilities to manage the entire production process from creative  support, production planning, crew and vendor management to visual effects, to name a few.  3  Today, we employ hundreds of people in physical production, working on a wide variety of owned titles  spread across scripted and unscripted series, kids, international content, standup, docs and feature films  from all over the world. To support our efforts, we’ll need more production capacity; we recently  announced the selection of \\u200bAlbuquerque, New Mexico\\u200b as the site of a new US production hub, where we  anticipate bringing $1 billion dollars in production over the next 10 years and creating up to 1,000  production jobs per year. Our internal studio is already the single largest supplier of content to Netflix  (on a cash basis).  We strive to offer a wide breadth of programming because we want to maximize the size of our  membership base and people have very diverse tastes that we seek to satisfy. This also reduces our  dependence on any individual title. Even our largest titles, which are viewed by tens of millions of our  members, only account for a low single digit percentage of total streaming hours. Therefore, the vast  majority of our growth in any given quarter is not attributable to any one piece of content, as you can  see by the steadiness in our paid net additions.   This past quarter, in original series, we launched new seasons of \\u200bOrange is the New Black\\u200b, \\u200bOzark\\u200b,  Marvel’s Luke Cage\\u200b and debuted \\u200bInsatiable\\u200b. Late in the quarter, we released \\u200bManiac\\u200b, a limited series  starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill.  We have also been ramping up our animated adult comedy  offering. In Q3, we successfully premiered \\u200bDisenchantment\\u200b, from Matt Groening who created \\u200bThe  Simpsons\\u200b and \\u200bFuturama\\u200b, and \\u200bParadise PD\\u200b, from the makers of \\u200bBrickleberry\\u200b, to complement \\u200bBig Mouth\\u200b,  Bojack Horseman\\u200b and \\u200bF is for Family\\u200b.  We also continue to expand our international originals, with projects spanning India, Mexico, Spain,  Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and throughout the Middle East to just name a few. In India, our  hit series \\u200bSacred Games\\u200b was followed up by \\u200bGhoul\\u200b in late August. \\u200bLa Casa de las Flores\\u200b, our latest  Mexican original, has become a big hit.   As part of our \\u200bSummer of Love\\u200b and building on the success of \\u200bSet It Up\\u200b and \\u200bThe Kissing Booth\\u200b, we  released original films \\u200bLike Father\\u200b (starring Kristen Bell and Kelsey Grammer in a daughter-father  dramedy), \\u200bSierra Burgess Is a Loser\\u200b (starring \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b’ Barb, Shannon Purser) and \\u200bTo All the Boys  I’ve Loved Before\\u200b, which is one of our most viewed original films ever with strong repeat viewing. More  than 80 million accounts have watched one or more of the \\u200bSummer of Love\\u200b films globally and we are  already in production for the next set of original rom-coms for our members.   This December, we'll be launching \\u200bROMA\\u200b, from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón. We support  simultaneous release in cinema and on Netflix, and the film will debut on Netflix and on over 100  screens worldwide, just as we are doing currently with \\u200b22 July\\u200b, from Oscar-nominated director Paul  Greengrass. We believe in our member-centric simultaneous release model for our original films and  welcome additional theatre chains that are open to carrying our films to provide the shared-viewing,  big-screen experience to their customers who enjoy that option.  We’ve come a long way in the five years since launching original content on Netflix. In addition to our  commercial success, we’re ecstatic when the creators we work with are recognized for their inspiring  work. This year, Netflix originals led with 112 Emmy nominations spanning 40 of our shows, docs and  4  specials across nearly every category and we’re humbled to have tied HBO with the most number of  Emmy wins with 23.   We’re also thrilled that Netflix has been a launching pad for a new generation of global stars like Millie  Bobby Brown, Jacob Elordi, Noah Centineo and Gaten Matarazzo. When our service helps our talent  develop huge fan bases (from small followings to over 10 million Instagram followers), we can attract  the best talent in the world. This explosive growth in popularity is a good indicator that our shows and  stars are breaking out around the planet.     More EU content\\xa0 The European Union is currently rewriting its audio visual rules, which will eventually require  subscription streaming services to devote a minimum of 30% of their catalog to European works. In  addition, some member states are looking to require services like ours to invest some portion of local  revenues into European works. We anticipate being able to meet these requirements by evolving our  content offering.  We are heavily investing around the world to share stories broadly and to strengthen local production  capacity and opportunity. We'd prefer to focus on making our service great for our members, which  would include producing local content, rather than on satisfying quotas, but we anticipate that a  regional content quota which approximates the region's share of our global membership will only  marginally reduce member satisfaction. Nonetheless, quotas, regardless of market size, can negatively  impact both the customer experience and creativity. We believe a more effective way for a country to  support strong local content is to directly incentivize local content creators, independent of distribution  channel.  5  Product and Partnerships  We continue to expand our partnerships with pay TV providers, ISPs and mobile operators across the  globe. In Q3, we rolled out the first mobile bundle in Japan with KDDI and expanded our partnership  with Verizon to pre-install the Netflix app on Android phones. In Q4, we plan to roll out our previously  announced partnership with Sky UK.   Competition  We compete for entertainment time with linear TV, YouTube, video gaming, web browsing, social  media, DVD and PPV, and more. In that competition for screen hours, we lose most of the time, but we  win enough to keep growing.   As internet entertainment grows, more companies see the large opportunity. Content companies such  as WarnerMedia and Disney/Fox are moving to self-distribute their own content; tech firms like Apple,  Amazon and others are investing in premium content to enhance their distribution platforms. Amid  these massive competitors on both sides, plus traditional media firms, our job is to make Netflix stand  out so that when consumers have free time, they choose to spend it with our service.   Within linear TV, New Fox appears to have a great strategy, which is to focus on large  simultaneous-viewing sports and news. These content areas are not transformed by on-demand viewing  and personalization in the way that TV series and movies are, so they are more resistant to the rise of  the internet. Other linear networks are likely to follow this model over time.   Free Cash Flow  Free cash flow in Q3 was -$859 million vs. -$465 million in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, our  growing mix of self-produced content, which requires us to fund content during the production phase  prior to its release on Netflix, is the primary driver of our working capital needs that creates the gap  between our positive net income and our free cash flow deficit.   We anticipate that FCF will be closer to -$3 billion than to -$4 billion for the full year 2018. We expect  our quarterly FCF deficit will increase sequentially from Q3 to Q4 as our year to date FCF is -$1.7 billion.  We currently see next year’s negative FCF as roughly flat with this year.   We recognize we are making huge cash investments in content, and we want to assure our investors  that we have the same high confidence in the underlying economics as our cash investments in the past.  These investments we see as very likely to help us to keep our revenue and operating profits growing for  a very long time ahead.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding reclassification of personnel costs and its impact on  financials; revenue impact of no free trials; impact of our Albuquerque, NM production hub; internal  studio as supplier of content; expansion of international originals; content launches, including  simultaneous release in theatre and on Netflix; our ability to adapt to changing content laws in Europe;  partnerships; competition; content spend and strategy, including outside the US and impact on future  growth; resistance to internet competition for certain linear TV strategies; domestic and international  net, total and paid membership; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both  domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margins; net  income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject  to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer  usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,  competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and  events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the  7  Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form  10-K/A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 5, 2018. The Company provides  internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these  forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form  10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A.

Paid net adds totaled 6.8m compared to our 7.0m forecast and prior year Q3 of 6.1m. As  we’ve improved the variety, diversity and quality of our content slate, member engagement has grown,  revenue has increased, and we’re able to further fund our content investment.     Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  In Q3’19, average streaming paid memberships and ARPU grew 22% and 9% year over year, respectively.  Excluding a -$137m year over year impact from F/X, consolidated revenue growth was 35%, while  streaming ARPU growth was 12%. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above our  guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4’19. EPS  amounted to $1.47 vs. $0.89 and included a $171 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X  remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Our Euro bonds provide us with a small natural hedge  for our growing European revenues.   Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. As a reminder,  the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for  accuracy. In Q3, our guidance forecast was our most accurate in recent history.  1      In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are  2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention  has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US  membership growth. On a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a  meaningful impact on paid net adds. However, revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU  increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. With more revenue, we’ll continue to invest to improve our  service to further strengthen our value proposition.  International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and  slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over  the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international  revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We’re making strides  in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing  encouraging signs of progress.   For Q4, we’re expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU  growth. We’re forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for  the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last  year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast  reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content  slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor  elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. As we outline in  more detail below, our long term outlook on our business is unchanged.   2      We’re on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we’ll be targeting  another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin  improvement we’ve delivered each year since 2017. As we’ve said previously, large swings in F/X could  lead to some variations from our steady annual margin progression, partially because we don’t buy  derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half of our revenue is not in US dollars.   Content  We strive to program Netflix with the best variety of high quality content across many genres (scripted  series, films, docs, comedy specials, unscripted TV, kids & family, anime, etc.). Our ambitious approach  reflects our goal to satisfy the entertainment desires of our 158m-plus members and to attract as many  of the hundreds of millions of non-members as we can. To accomplish this, we need great breadth of  quality content because people have very diverse tastes.   If you think about your own habits, you’ll recognize that what you want to watch on a Friday night may  differ from what you want to watch on Tuesday after a long day of work or what you want to watch with  your family on Saturday morning or what you want to watch with your friends on Sunday afternoon.  Now, multiply that by the billions of people on the planet and all the other factors that affect viewing  preferences and you will have a sense of the breadth of programming necessary to be as successful as  we desire.   We have been moving increasingly to original content both because of the anticipated pullback of  second run content from some studios and because our original content is working in the form of  member viewing and engagement. We started first with English scripted TV series more than six years  ago to great success. We continued in Q3 with \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b Season 3 (the most watched season to  date with 64m member households in its first four weeks). We also introduced new limited series like  3    Unbelievable\\u200b, one of our most thought provoking and highly viewed dramas (watched by 32m member  households in its first 28 days).  We’re expanding our non-English language original offerings because they continue to help grow our  penetration in international markets. In Q3, Season 3 of\\u200b \\u200bLa Casa de Papel\\u200b (aka \\u200bMoney Heist\\u200b) became the  most watched show on Netflix across our non-English language territories with 44m households  watching the new season in the first four weeks of release. \\u200bSintonia\\u200b, our latest Brazilian original, was the  second most watched inaugural season in Brazil. \\u200bThe Naked Director\\u200b broke out as the biggest title launch  for us in Japan and was also highly successful throughout Asia. Similarly, in India, we debuted the second  season of \\u200bSacred Games\\u200b, our most watched show in India. To date, we have globally released 100  seasons of local language, original scripted series from 17 countries and have plans for over 130 more in  2020. We also plan to expand our investment in local language original films and unscripted series.   We’re also investing aggressively in original films and making great progress with improving results. Our  original film slate in Q3 featured several solid hits like \\u200bSecret Obsession\\u200b (starring Brenda Song) and  Otherhood\\u200b (directed by Cindy Chupack in her feature directorial debut), which were  watched by 40  million and 29 million households in their first four weeks, respectively. \\u200bTall Girl\\u200b,\\u200b a new family film  starring Ava Michelle, was also a success with 41m households watching in the first 28 days. We expect  that our Q4 film releases will continue to build and strengthen our film effort. Q4 film releases include  Martin Scorsese’s \\u200bThe Irishman\\u200b (with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci), \\u200bMarriage Story\\u200b (starring  Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and \\u200bThe Two Popes\\u200b (featuring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan  Pryce), all of which have emerged as early Oscar frontrunners. We also have several big releases such as  Dolemite is My Name\\u200b (starring Eddie Murphy and featuring a breakout performance from \\u200bDa'Vine Joy  Randolph\\u200b), \\u200b6 Underground\\u200b (directed by Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds), \\u200bThe Laundromat\\u200b, from  director Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman and\\u200b \\u200bThe King\\u200b \\u200b(starring \\u200bTimothée  Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton) as well as animated features\\u200b \\u200bKlaus\\u200b and \\u200bI Lost My Body\\u200b.  Our goal is to have the quality of our slate rival the ambition of its scope. An example is \\u200bOrange is the  New Black\\u200b, which wrapped its final new season in Q3. The show was celebrated by fans and the media  for the groundbreaking role it played for Netflix and the culture at large; Time Magazine said   “...’Orange is the New Black’ is the most important TV show of the decade.”\\u200b  Our very popular \\u200bOzark,  Our Planet, Queer Eye, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\\u200b and \\u200bWhen They See Us\\u200b led 40 Netflix original series  and films to a record 117 Emmy Nominations and 27 wins in 2019.  With so many firms now looking to provide premium video content to consumers, it’s a great time to be  a creator of content. Amazing content can be expensive. We don’t shy away from taking bold swings if  we think the business impact will also be amazing. We don’t close every deal we chase and we don’t  chase every deal on the table. And while not all projects that we do pursue will work out, our large and  growing subscription base helps enable us to try many approaches, while the size of our content budget  (~$10 billion on P&L spend and ~$15 billion in cash content spend in 2019) insulates us from  dependency on any single title. We’ll continue to learn as we go, while staying disciplined by assessing  each opportunity individually, steadily marching up our operating margin and improving free cash flow.     4    Product and Partnerships  We seek to make it easier for future members to sign up and enjoy Netflix. To that end, we rolled out a  lower priced mobile plan in India in July and we’re pleased with the results. Our approach with pricing is  to grow revenue and so far, uptake and retention on our mobile plan in India has been better than our  initial testing suggested. This will allow us to invest more in Indian content to further satisfy our  members. While still only a very small percentage of our total subscriber base, we’re continuing to test  mobile-only plans in other markets.   We continued to expand our partner-based bundle offerings, adding bundles with Sky Italia, Canal+ in  France, KDDI in Japan and Izzi in Mexico this quarter. We just localized our service in Vietnamese,  Hungarian and Czech so that more entertainment fans can enjoy thousands of hours of TV shows and  films in their preferred language. We’ll continue to expand language coverage and accessibility.  Competition  We compete broadly for entertainment time. This means there are many competitive activities to Netflix  (from watching linear TV to playing video games, for example). But there is also a very large market  opportunity; today we believe we’re less than 10% of TV screen time in the US (our most mature  market) and much less than that in mobile screen time. Many are focused on the “streaming wars,” but  we’ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade.  The upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased  competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV. While the new competitors have some great  titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming  that we are producing around the world.   The launch of these new services will be noisy. There may be some modest headwind to our near-term  growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we’ll  continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. By way of  example, our growth in Canada, where Hulu does not exist, is nearly identical to our growth in the US  (where Hulu is very successful at about 30 million paid memberships). Our penetration in both markets  below:  5      We believe this is due to the big factor of streaming growing into linear TV plus the fact that streaming  video services have mostly exclusive content libraries that make them highly differentiated from one  another. In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the  shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast  TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for  many players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and  Discovery didn’t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience  share from broadcast viewing.   Content creation is booming around the world and everyone is vying for consumer attention. Over the  next 10 years, many streaming services will grow viewing as streaming replaces linear TV. Our focus will  continue to be on pleasing our members and growing engagement because that approach has served us  well since 1997. Total viewing, as measured by various 3rd parties, is the best indicator of our relative  success since it’s a signal of customer satisfaction, and few of the services will disclose streaming video  revenue, and subscriber figures are hard to interpret (given bundles, discounts and other promotions).  Our focused approach to date has driven meaningful growth in our membership base and engagement.   We did well during the first decade of streaming. We’ve been preparing for this new wave of  competition for a long time. It’s why we started investing in originals in 2012 and expanded aggressively  ever since - across programming categories and countries with an ambition to share stories from the  world to the world. In Q4, with \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b, \\u200bThe Witcher\\u200b, \\u200bKlaus\\u200b, \\u200bThe Irishman\\u200b, \\u200bThe Two Popes\\u200b, \\u200b6  Underground\\u200b, and many other amazing titles launching, we’re ready to compete to earn consumers’  attention and viewing.      6    Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Net cash used in operating activities in Q3’19 was -$502 million vs. -$690 million in the prior year period.  Free cash flow  in Q3 totaled -$551 million vs. -$859 million in Q3’18. For the full year 2019, we’re still  1 expecting FCF of approximately -$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding  operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we’re  expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually  beyond 2020. As we move slowly toward FCF positive, our plan is to continue to use the high yield  market in the interim to finance our investment needs.   Next Year Reporting  Starting with our Q4’19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership  by region, which is how we think about our business. Our four regions are Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe,  Middle East & Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM), and the US and Canada (UCAN). UCAN is roughly  90% US and 10% Canada. Under this new reporting format, we’ll only provide membership guidance for  global\\u200b paid memberships for the next quarter with each earnings report.   As we self-produce and license more original content that has global rights, we are finding US vs.  international segment contribution margin reporting is becoming less useful internally. We’ll stop  reporting on it in January 2020 and continue to focus on global operating margin as our primary  profitability metric. As a reminder, we’ll no longer report free trial members beginning in 2020 as we  informed you in our \\u200bQ3’18 investor letter\\u200b.   1 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the  reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.  7      Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bJuly 2019\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2019\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2019\\u200b,   October 2018\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2018\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2018\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2018\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2017\\u200b.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  8    that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q3-20-Shareholder-Letter': \"Fellow shareholders,  As we expected, growth has slowed with 2.2m paid net adds in Q3 vs. 6.8m in Q3’19. We think this is  primarily due to our record first half results and the pull-forward effect we described in our April and  July letters. In the first nine months of 2020, we added 28.1m paid memberships, which exceeds the  27.8m that we added for all of 2019. In these challenging times, we’re dedicated to serving our  members.    Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Q3 average streaming paid memberships rose 25%, while streaming ARPU decreased 1.6% year over  year. Excluding a foreign exchange (F/X) impact of -$158m, streaming ARPU increased 1% vs. prior year.  Revenue was 2% above our beginning-of-quarter guidance primarily due to slightly higher than expected  ARPU (favorable plan mix in our UCAN, LATAM and APAC regions plus intra-quarter appreciation in the  Euro and British pound which helped lift EMEA ARPU).  As a result, operating margin of 20% (up 170bps  year over year) exceeded our guidance forecast as well. EPS of $1.74 vs. $1.47 a year ago included a  $249m non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which  accounted for the variance with our EPS guidance.   We added 2.2m net memberships in Q3, compared with our 2.5m guidance. Retention remains healthy  and engagement per member household was up solidly year over year in Q3’20. As a reminder, our  1  guidance is our internal forecast and we strive for accuracy. That means in some quarters our results will  be high relative to our guidance forecast and, in others, it will be low.    Our APAC region was the largest contributor to our paid membership growth this quarter (46% of Q3  global paid net adds) and APAC revenue rose 66% year over year. We’re pleased with the progress we’re  making in this region and, in particular, that we’ve achieved double digit penetration of broadband  homes in both South Korea and Japan. While this is encouraging, we still have much work to do and  we're working hard to replicate this success in India and other countries.   For Q4‘20, we forecast 6.0m paid net adds vs 8.8m in Q4‘19. As we have highlighted in our recent  investor letters, we believe our record first half paid net additions would result in slower growth in the  back half of this year. If we achieve our forecast, it will put us at a record 34m paid net adds for 2020,  well above our prior annual high of 28.6m in 2018.  The state of the pandemic and its impact continues to make projections very uncertain, but as the world  hopefully recovers in 2021, we would expect that our growth will revert back to levels similar to  pre-COVID. In turn, we expect paid net adds are likely to be down year over year in the first half of 2021  as compared to the big spike in paid net adds we experienced in the first half of 2020. We continue to  view quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not that meaningful in the context of the long  run adoption of internet entertainment, which we believe is still early and should provide us with many  years of strong future growth as we continue to improve our service.  2    We forecast Q4 operating margin of 13.5% vs. 8.4% last year, which means we’ll over-deliver this year  on our original full year margin target; our FY20 operating margin is now expected to be 18% (vs. 16%  originally) or a 500 basis point increase year over year. Since 2016, we will have more than quadrupled  our annual GAAP operating margin (which is our primary profitability metric).   As in the past, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year and at an average rate of  300 basis points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate more lumpiness. Some years we’ll  be a little over (like this year when we expect to grow operating margin 500bps), some years a little  under, but we are trying to keep on a 300 bps per year long-term trajectory. The increased lumpiness is  due to increased F/X exposure from our international success and COVID’s impact on the timing of  spending. By moving to this multi-year model, we’ll be able to manage our short term expenses more  smoothly as well as grow slightly more efficiently than in the past. As we wrote last quarter, for 2021,  we’re targeting a 19% operating margin.   Content  We are making good and careful progress returning to production, particularly in EMEA and APAC, but  also across much of LATAM and UCAN. We’ve restarted production on some of our biggest titles  including season four of \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b, action film \\u200bRed Notice\\u200b (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot  and Ryan Reynolds) and \\u200bThe Witcher\\u200b season two. Since the almost-global shutdown of production back  in mid-March, we have already completed principal photography on 50+ productions and, while the  course and impact of C-19 remains unpredictable, we’re optimistic we will complete shooting on over  150 other productions by year-end.  For our 2021 slate, we continue to expect the number of Netflix originals launched on our service to be  up year over year in each quarter of 2021 and we’re confident that we’ll have an exciting range of  programming for our members, particularly relative to other entertainment service options. As  3  discussed last quarter, some of our most popular returning titles are expected to launch in the second  half of next year.   This past quarter, the breadth of our programming was demonstrated with standout titles across many  genres. In English language series, we debuted new seasons of \\u200bThe Umbrella Academy \\u200band \\u200bLucifer\\u200b; 43m  and 38m member households chose to watch these titles in the first 28 days, respectively. In  mid-September, we also premiered Ryan Murphy’s \\u200bRatched\\u200b, a thriller based on the character from \\u200bOne  Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest\\u200b. In its first four weeks, 48m member households chose to watch \\u200bRatched\\u200b.  Our #1 and #2 most watched documentary feature films ever were released in Q3.  \\u200bAmerican Murder:  The Family Next Door\\u200b is projected to have 52m members households choose the title in its first 28 days  and \\u200bThe Social Dilemma\\u200b had 38m in its first 28 days.   We continue to invest heavily in local language content because we believe that great stories are  universal: they can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. Season one of the Mexican  telenovela \\u200bOscuro Deseo\\u200b (\\u200bDark Desire\\u200b) was our biggest local language original globally this quarter. Our  slate of Korean dramas continue to travel well throughout APAC and beyond, while anime is another  category of content with fans all over the world.   Another example of our content traveling around the globe is our non-fiction series \\u200bIndian  Matchmaking\\u200b, which was watched by a quarter of our members in India and millions of members  outside of India in its first four weeks.   Original film continues to be an area of opportunity for us and we had several big hits in Q3. Action  thriller \\u200bThe Old Guard\\u200b (starring Charlize Theron and \\u200bdirected by Gina Prince-Bythewood\\u200b) was our most  popular title of the quarter with 78m member households choosing to watch in its first four weeks. Our  romantic comedy \\u200bThe Kissing Booth 2\\u200b received strong reception (66m member households chose to  watch in the first 28 days), while action film \\u200bProject Power\\u200b (starring Jamie Foxx) was also very popular  (75m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks). Late in September, we debuted \\u200bEnola  Holmes\\u200b, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill as her famed detective brother. We estimate 76m  member households will have chosen this film in the first 28 days.   Our content successes highlight our ability to tap into our global audience of nearly 200m members and  underscore the notion that content is \\u200bdiscovered\\u200b on Netflix. This applies not only to Netflix originals, but  also to second run programming, like \\u200bSchitt’s Creek\\u200b and earlier seasons of \\u200bLucifer\\u200b, both of which are very  popular with our members. The latest example is \\u200bCobra Kai\\u200b (based on \\u200bThe Karate Kid\\u200b films), which  originally debuted on YouTube’s subscription service in May 2018 and recently launched on Netflix on  August 28. In its first four weeks of release on Netflix, 50m member households chose to watch season  one, dramatically expanding its audience.   We’re looking forward to season 3 of \\u200bCobra Kai\\u200b premiering exclusively on Netflix on January 8, 2021. In  addition to the recently released \\u200bThe Haunting of Bly Manor\\u200b (a follow up to the acclaimed \\u200bThe Haunting  of Hill House\\u200b), season one of \\u200bEmily in Paris\\u200b and Adam Sandler’s latest film \\u200bHubie Halloween\\u200b, other  notable Q4 titles include our animated family film \\u200bOver the Moon\\u200b from legendary creator Glen Keane  (premiering this weekend), season four of our award-winning series \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b and the first season of  Selena\\u200b. We’ll also have a great slate of films, including \\u200bThe Midnight Sky\\u200b (directed by and starring George  4  Clooney), \\u200bHillbilly Elegy\\u200b (from Ron Howard), \\u200bMa Rainey’s Black  Bottom\\u200b (with Viola Davis and Chadwick  Boseman), \\u200bThe Christmas Chronicles 2\\u200b \\u200b(from Chris Columbus),  \\u200bJingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey\\u200b (with  Forest Whitaker), \\u200bMANK\\u200b (David Fincher’s first feature at Netflix) and Ryan Murphy’s \\u200bThe Prom\\u200b (starring  Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden and Kerry Washington).   Product and Partnerships  We strive to be a global entertainment service that can satisfy the needs of members all over the world.  Commissioning and producing local language content is an important part of that. But we also invest  heavily into improving our product, partnerships and overall consumer experience. For example, in India  in Q3, we localized our service to support Hindi in our user interface.    We’re also working with local partners like Reliance Jio, India’s largest mobile operator, where in Q3 we  launched a bundle with their mobile and fiber broadband plans. As part of this broad partnership, we’ll  integrate Netflix with two of Jio’s set top boxes. We’ve also partnered with financial institutions in India  to make payment processing easier and more seamless for our members, which we expect will have  retention benefits. All of these initiatives are important and work in concert with our big investment in  local originals to improve the Netflix experience for our members.   Competition  Competition for consumers’ time and engagement remains vibrant.  Linear television and other big  categories of entertainment, like video games and user generated content from YouTube and TikTok are  all vying for consumers’ attention and are strong drivers of screen time usage.  We remain quite small  relative to overall screen time.   This past quarter, we saw the debut of Comcast’s Peacock, which comes on the heels of the launch of  HBO Max and Disney+. Disney’s recent management reorganization signals that it is embracing the shift  to streaming entertainment. We’re thrilled to be competing with Disney and a growing number of other  5  players to entertain people; both consumers and content creators will benefit from our mutual desire to  bring the best stories to audiences all over the world.   We’ll continue to focus on pleasing our members and improving our service as quickly as possible so  that we can be everyone's first choice for online entertainment.   Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was +$1.3 billion vs. -$502 million in the prior year  period. Free cash flow (FCF)  was positive for a third consecutive quarter at +$1.1b vs. -$551 million in  1 Q3‘19. Year to date free cash flow is +$2.2 billion vs. -$1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2019.   As productions increasingly restart, we expect Q4’20 FCF to be slightly negative and therefore, for the  full year 2020, we forecast FCF to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of  break-even to positive. This change is due primarily to our higher operating margin expectation for 2020  and the timing of cash spending on content. We expect our FCF profile over the coming years to  continue to improve as we increase our profitability and our transition to the production of Netflix  originals (which requires more cash upfront vs. second run content) matures. For 2021, we currently  expect free cash flow to be -$1 billion to break-even.  With $8.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter plus our $750m credit facility  (which is undrawn), our need for external financing is diminishing. As indicated last quarter, we don’t  have plans to access the capital markets this year.

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q3-21-Shareholder-Letter': 'After a lighter-than-normal content slate in Q1 and Q2 due to COVID-related production delays in 2020, we are seeing the positive effects of a stronger slate in the second half of the year. In Q3, we grew revenue 16% year over year to $7.5 billion, while operating income rose 33% vs. the prior year quarter to $1.8 billion. We added 4.4m paid net adds (vs. 2.2m in Q3’20) to end the quarter with 214m paid memberships. We’re very excited to finish the year with what we expect to be our strongest Q4 content offering yet, which shows up as bigger content expense and lower operating margins sequentially. Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast Revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 9% and 7% increase in average paid streaming memberships and ARM , respectively. Excluding a foreign exchange (FX) impact of +$128m, ARM rose 5% year over year. 1 Operating margin for Q3 amounted to 23.5%, a three percentage point increase vs. the year ago period. This was above our beginning of quarter forecast due to the timing of content spend, as well as lower than forecasted marketing spend. EPS of $3.19 vs. $1.74 a year ago included a $136m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We under-forecasted paid net adds for the quarter (4.4m actual vs. our 3.5m projection), while ending paid memberships of 214m was within 0.4% of our forecast. For the second consecutive quarter, the APAC region was our largest contributor to membership growth with 2.2m paid net adds (half of total paid net adds) as we are continuing to improve our service in this region. In EMEA, paid net adds of 1.8m improved sequentially vs. the 188k in Q2 as several titles had a particularly strong impact. The UCAN and 1 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 LATAM regions grew paid memberships more slowly. These regions have higher penetration of broadband homes although we believe we still have ample runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. For Q4’21, we forecast paid net adds of 8.5m, consistent with Q4’20 paid net additions. For the full year 2021, we forecast an operating margin of 20% or slightly better. This means that Q4’21 operating margin will be approximately 6.5% compared with 14% in Q4’20. The year over year decline in operating margin is due mostly to our backloaded big content release schedule in this Q4, which will result in a roughly 19% year over year increase in content amortization for Q4’21 (compared with ~8% growth year to date). Content Our programming strategy is to provide members with a wide variety of high quality content that’s loved and watched in large numbers. Season five of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist) and season three of Sex Education were two of our biggest returning shows in the quarter with 69m and 55m member households, respectively, choosing to watch these fan favorites in the first four weeks. On the heels of The Queen’s Gambit, we’ve had another limited series hit with Maid which launched just after quarter-end on October 1. We expect this story about living on the poverty line by award-winning playwright and screenwriter Molly Smith Metzler to reach 67m households during its first four weeks. La Casa de Papel was our first non-English language title to show that - with subtitling and dubbing - great stories truly can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world. While the goal of our local content executives is always to create locally authentic stories that will resonate in their country (like The Chestnut Man which we expect to be watched by 2 approximately two thirds of our Danish members during its first four weeks), Netflix is a global, direct-to-consumer service which enables creators to reach broader audiences - and gives our members an even greater choice of stories to enjoy. There is no better example of this than Squid Game, a unique Korean story that first captured the zeitgeist in Korea and then globally. Released on September 17, it has become our biggest TV show ever. A mind-boggling 142m member households globally have chosen to watch the title in its first four weeks. The breadth of Squid Game’s popularity is truly amazing; this show has been ranked as our #1 program in 94 countries (including the US). Like some of our other big hits, Squid Game has also pierced the cultural zeitgeist, spawning a Saturday Night Live skit and memes/clips on TikTok with more than 42 billion views. Demand for consumer products to celebrate the fandom for Squid Game is high and those items are on their way to retail now. Our film slate also continues to build with a variety of successful Q3 titles such as action film Sweet Girl starring Jason Momoa (68m member households chose to watch in the first four weeks), Kissing Booth 3 (59m), the last installment in the rom com trilogy, the animated family film Vivo (46m) and Blood Red Sky, a German-language action horror movie (53m). Later in the year, we will shift to reporting on hours viewed for our titles rather than the number of accounts that choose to watch them. There is some difference in rankings, as you see below, but we think engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction. It also matches how outside services measure TV viewing and gives proper credit to rewatching. In addition, we will start to release title metrics more regularly outside of our earnings report so our members and the industry can better measure success in the streaming world. 3 * Total hours viewed per title in its first 28 days on Netflix. ** The number of accounts that have watched at least two minutes of that title in its first 28 days on Netflix. Data as of 9/27/21. We’re honored to have garnered the most Emmys ever for any single network or service in a season of television, with 44 (tying CBS’ tally in 1974 when there were only three national networks). This included our first best Drama series win (The Crown), while The Queen’s Gambit won 11 out of 18 nominations, including the coveted best limited series. Both titles are among our most popular ever, demonstrating critical and commercial success. During Q3, we announced our agreement to acquire the Roald Dahl Story Company, pending regulatory approval. This was an opportunity to purchase a beloved and enduring portfolio of intellectual property including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, James and the Giant Peach, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Twits, to name just a few. Roald Dahl’s books have been translated into 63 languages and have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. Once we close, we’ll be looking to develop even more of these stories into new formats across the live action television and films, animation and pre-school categories. We’ve begun testing our games offering in select countries. It remains very early days for this initiative and, like other content categories we’ve expanded into, we plan to try different types of games, learn from our members and improve our game library. During Q3, we acquired Night School Studio, the maker of critically acclaimed games like OXENFREE, to help build out our game development capabilities. 4 As a reminder, games on Netflix will be included in members’ subscriptions and will not have advertisements or in-app purchases so game play is purely focused on enjoyment versus monetization. We’re eagerly anticipating the rest of our Q4 slate, which includes a great mix of popular returning English language series like The Witcher, You, Tiger King and Cobra Kai, big returning non-English series like Sintonia and the final chapter of La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), as well as exciting new movies such as the action film Red Notice (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds), Don’t Look Up with an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep, as well as The Harder They Fall featuring Jonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, LaKeith Stanfield, Regina King and Idris Elba, Army of Thieves (the prequel to our hit movie, Army of the Dead) and The Unforgivable starring Sandra Bullock, Viola Davis and Jon Bernthal. The latest films from acclaimed directors Jane Campion (The Power Of The Dog) and Paolo Sorrentino (The Hand of God) are also coming to Netflix in Q4. Assuming no new Covid waves or unforeseen events that result in large scale production shutdowns, we currently anticipate a more normalized content slate in 2022, with a greater number of originals in 2022 vs. 2021 and a release schedule that is more balanced over the course of the year, as compared to 2021. Product We try many different approaches to see what might help our growth. One example in Q3 was the launch of a free plan for mobile users in Kenya. This plan is a great way for anyone in Kenya with an Android mobile phone to explore Netflix - with access to great content, personalized recommendations, and parental controls. We hope that this encourages more people to sign up for a paid membership so that they can watch Netflix on any device (mobile, TV, or laptop), access more features (e.g. downloads) and enjoy our entire catalog. It will take a year or two to determine if this technique helps our paid membership growth or not. We know that members most value the variety and quality of our content. Great recommendations are key to ensuring they can experience that breadth and diversity. So we continue to invest in our recommendations to ensure members can easily find great stories to enjoy on our service. One example of our ability to surface relevant programming is Manifest, a TV series that aired on NBC for three seasons and was subsequently cancelled in June 2021. We added Manifest to our service in the US and Canada during the summer of 2021. In the UCAN region, 25m member households chose to watch this title in its first 28 days and we’ve ordered a fourth and final season given the popularity of the show. Marketing & Communications In addition to having best in class content and a product experience that allows members to easily find shows and movies they love, we also want our programming to be talked about and in the cultural zeitgeist. In September, we held our first global fan event, TUDUM, which featured news, first looks and trailers from over 100 of the most anticipated Netflix films and series of the next 12 months. TUDUM was a new way for us to connect fans with our titles, talent and brand and to drive conversation at a global scale and trended at #2 globally the day of the event on Twitter. Additionally, TUDUM and the 5 trailers/content released following the event were watched by fans in over 180 countries, generating close to 700m views and more than 3 billion impressions in less than four days. Competition We compete with a staggeringly large set of activities for consumers’ time and attention like watching linear TV, reading a book, browsing TikTok, or playing Fortnite, to name just a few. As one example of this dynamic, on October 4, when Facebook experienced a global outage for several hours, our engagement saw a 14% increase during this time period. We are still quite small, with a lot of opportunity for growth; in our largest and most penetrated market, according to Nielsen, we are still less than 10% of US television screen time. Our approach as always is to improve our service as quickly as we can so that we can earn a greater share of people’s time. Share of Total US TV Time, September 2021(Total Day, Persons 2+) Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $82 million vs. $1.3 billion in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was -$106 million vs. $1.1 billion in Q3‘20. FCF in last year’s 2 Q3 was helped by COVID-related production shutdowns. Year to date FCF is $410m. With production volume ramping successfully and a lower operating margin in Q4, we anticipate Q4 ‘21 FCF to be negative. We continue to expect full year 2021 FCF to be approximately breakeven (plus or minus several hundred million dollars depending on the timing of production starts and related cash spending on content). We anticipate being FCF positive on an annual basis in 2022 and beyond. 2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6 As we discussed previously, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing to fund our day-to-day operations. During the quarter, we repurchased 0.2m shares for $100 million. Our slower buyback pace this quarter reflects the pick up in our M&A activity. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above and beyond our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) In March, we committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022 and to reduce our emissions to be in line with the latest climate science, ensuring that our internal reductions are consistent with a trajectory of no more than 1.5℃ of warming. We’ve been making progress on this initiative. We provided an update in September here.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q3-22-Shareholder-Letter': 'Summary:  Revenue, operating income and membership slightly exceeded our forecast in Q3’22.  We had big hits across TV and film in Q3 – launching some of our most watched series and films of all time, including: ○ Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, Stranger Things S4, Extraordinary Attorney Woo, The Gray Man, and Purple Hearts  Our lower priced ad-supported plan launches in 12 countries in November – just six months after our initial announcement. Our existing plans remain ad free.  Netflix has higher engagement than any other streamer – with room for growth: ○ In the UK, Netflix accounts for 8.2% of video viewing, 2.3x Amazon and 2.7x Disney+ ; 1 ○ In the US, Netflix accounts for 7.6% of TV time, 2.6x Amazon and 1.4x Disney + Hulu + Hulu Live . 2  Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix\\'s $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit. After a challenging first half, we believe we’re on a path to reaccelerate growth. The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us. 2 Based on Nielsen’s Gauge, as of August 2022 1 Based on reporting from BARB, as of September 2022 1 Q3 Results Our 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 was driven by a 5% increase in average paid memberships and a 1% rise in ARM . Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (F/X), revenue and ARM grew 13% and 3 8% year-over-year, respectively. The sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to F/X. We under-forecasted paid net additions, which totaled 2.4 million vs. our 1.0m forecast and compared to 4.4m in the year ago quarter.  In APAC, revenue grew 19% excluding F/X as average paid memberships rose 23% year-over-year. ARM was -3% year-over-year, excluding F/X, partially driven by lower ARM in India, somewhat offset by higher ARM in Australia and Korea. We added 1.4m paid memberships in the region (vs. 2.2m last Q3).  Excluding F/X, EMEA revenue and ARM grew 13% and 7%, respectively. Paid net adds totaled 0.6m vs. 1.8m in the year ago quarter.  In LATAM, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, supported by ARM growth of 16% vs. the year ago quarter excluding F/X. We added 0.3m paid memberships, in-line with membership growth in Q3’21.  In UCAN, our most penetrated market, ARM and revenue grew by 12% and 11%, respectively, excluding F/X. Paid net adds totaled 0.1m (similar to the 0.1m in Q3’21). For Q3, operating income totaled $1.5 billion vs. $1.8 billion in Q3’21. Operating income was above our beginning-of-quarter forecast, partially due to higher revenue, as well as a shift in timing of some spend from Q3 to Q4. As a result, operating margin of 19% was above our 16% forecast. The four percentage point year-over-year decline in operating margin is almost entirely due to the appreciation in the US dollar vs. most other currencies during this period. EPS of $3.10 vs. $3.19 a year ago included a $348 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Q4 Forecast As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. The appreciation of the US dollar remains a significant headwind for us (and US-based multinationals in general). For Q4’22, we’re expecting revenue of $7.8 billion with the sequential decline entirely due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar vs. other currencies. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Our revenue growth forecast is driven by our expectation for 4.5m paid net adds (vs. 8.3m in Q4’21) and ARM growth of 6% year-over-year, excluding F/X. Our paid net adds forecast assumes that we experience our usual seasonality as well as the impact of a strong content slate, counterbalanced by macroeconomic weakness which leads to less-than-normal visibility. While we’re very optimistic about our new advertising business, we don’t expect a material contribution in Q4’22 as we’re launching our Basic with Ads plan intra-quarter and anticipate growing our membership in that plan gradually over time. Our aim 3 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 2 is to give our prospective new members more choice - not switch members off their current plans. Members who don’t want to change will remain on their current plan, without ads, at the current price. We forecast Q4’22 operating margin of 4% vs. 8% in the year ago period. The fourth quarter is typically our lowest operating margin quarter of the year as it’s usually our largest quarter in terms of content and marketing spend. In addition, the aforementioned F/X impact has a high flow through to operating income (~75%-80% of the revenue impact) as most of our costs are in US dollars. Excluding the year-over-year impact of F/X, our Q4’22 operating margin forecast would be 10% vs. 8% in Q4’21. The US dollar has strengthened against most other currencies at a historic rate this year. Based on our YTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negatively impact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. As a reminder, our 2022 and 2023 operating margin target of 19%-20% is based on F/X rates in January 2022, as we discussed in our Q4’21 letter and subsequent earnings calls. We’re on track to meet this F/X neutral operating margin objective for 2022 (excluding the $150m of restructuring costs in Q2) and for 2023. With the appreciation of the US dollar though, our reported operating margin would be lower than 19%-20% should the US dollar remain above January 2022 levels relative to other currencies. Over the medium term, we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. Our long term goal remains unchanged - to sustain double digit revenue growth, increase operating profit even faster (as we expand margins) and deliver growing positive free cash flow. Guidance Evolution As discussed in previous letters, we are increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top line metric. This will become particularly important heading into 2023 as we develop new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing, where membership is just one component of our revenue growth. So, 3 starting with our Q4’22 letter in January of 2023, we’ll continue to provide guidance for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and fully diluted shares outstanding for the following quarter, but not paid membership. Similar to our regional membership disclosure, we’ll continue to report our global and regional membership each quarter as part of our earnings release. Content & Marketing We started our original programming strategy about a decade ago as we anticipated that some competitors would eventually stop licensing their content to Netflix. It’s been a huge challenge to build a lifetime of entertainment in just ten years in multiple languages and across so many different genres - series, films, animation, stand-up and non-fiction. And while we’ve had our share of misses, we’ve managed to create a very broad slate with many great series and films, for whatever your mood or tastes, from amazing storytellers around the world. Given everything we’ve learned, we’re confident we can deliver even more member value per content investment dollar over time. One of the best ways to understand the success of our content is by understanding our engagement. So we’re excited that BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board), the leading audience measurement and video ratings organization in the UK, is now reporting the share of video viewing for streaming services and broadcast groups in the UK on a monthly basis. In September, Netflix accounted for 8.2% of viewing, and we have more than 2x the monthly engagement of our next closest streaming competitor. This reporting is similar to Nielsen’s Gauge, which launched in May 2021 when Netflix accounted for 6% of viewing compared to 7.6% in August 2022. Our hope is that other measurement companies around the world will join Nielsen and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming and the viewing share of relevant entertainment companies. We think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles. This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love. As the Google Trends chart shows, the ability to watch all of Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story helped drive significant interest in the show. 4 It’s hard to imagine, for example, how a Korean title like Squid Game would have become a mega hit globally without the momentum that came from people being able to binge it. We believe the ability for our members to immerse themselves in a story from start to finish increases their enjoyment but also their likelihood to tell their friends, which then means more people watch, join and stay with Netflix. Our Q3 content slate was especially strong. In English scripted TV, we kicked off the quarter with Stranger Things S4, which generated 1.35 billion hours viewed - our biggest season of an English 4 language series ever. This was followed in August by The Sandman (351 million hours viewed), which was loved by fans and critics alike. Near the end of the quarter, we launched season five of fan favorite Cobra Kai (270 million hours viewed) and limited series Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story* (824 million hours viewed) from Ryan Murphy, which is now our second largest English series. We continue to see great success with our non-English programming too, with Squid Game making awards history by becoming the first foreign language title to win an Emmy - with six awards, including for directing, production design and lead actor. Also from Korea, Extraordinary Attorney Woo, a unique series about an autistic lawyer, has reached #1 on our weekly non-English series list in 28 countries, notching up 402 million hours viewed and making it our sixth largest non-English TV show ever through 28 days. Narco-Saints has been another huge K-Content win this quarter, with 128 million hours viewed since launch. Sintonia has been a big hit for Netflix in Brazil, with season three generating 38 million hours viewed. And while it is still early days for German series The Empress*, it launched with a very strong start (136 million hours viewed). Our goal is to create authentic local stories for members in the home territory, which we also make available globally. Film is incredibly important to our members. We expanded into original film in 2016 because producing our own movies across all budgets and genres has advantages over the next best alternative: only licensing from other studios in the first pay TV window (the “pay-one” window). Those advantages include first window availability on Netflix (pay-one movies debut generally well after theatrical release), global rights (pay-one movies are licensed by country), the ability to carry the films on Netflix in perpetuity (typically only for 18-24 months for pay-one films) and copyright ownership, enabling us to create derivatives like sequels and to use the intellectual property (IP) in games and consumer products. We continue to complement our original films with 3rd party licensed films - they remain an important and valued part of our service, but they are just one component of our broader programming strategy. We’re pleased with the progress of our original film initiative. The big budget action film The Gray Man (254 million hours viewed) reflects the scope of our ambition to create theatrical quality blockbusters that can reach huge audiences on Netflix: 118 million households (many of which are multi person) if you divide the total hours viewed by the film’s run time of 2 hours and 9 minutes. But since we’re not limited by the need to optimize for theatrical attendance, we can also produce a wider variety of films that consumers can enjoy. For example, the romantic drama Purple Hearts was a hit among our members with 229 million  hours viewed. We’re at an even earlier stage with animated feature films but in early Q3 we released The Sea Beast (165 million hours viewed), which is our biggest original animated 4 Hours viewed data is based on viewing in the first 28 days of release for each episode. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through October 16, 2022. We publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed at Netflix Top 10, where you can also find our detailed methodology. 5 film to date. On the non-English language film side, Darlings (33 million hours viewed), starring Alia Bhatt, launched to rave reviews and huge fandom in India. Loving Adults (67 million hours viewed), a psychological thriller from Denmark, and Carter (65 million hours viewed), a Korean blockbuster, were our two biggest non-English films of the quarter and are now our seventh and ninth most popular non-English films ever. We also continue to invest heavily in marketing, with a particular focus on innovative ways to drive conversation around our titles, which in turn boosts engagement for Netflix. For example, our campaigns for Stranger Things S4 and The Gray Man drove more than 9.8 billion and 1.2 billion impressions, respectively, across paid marketing, social media platforms and events. And content for Tudum, our global fan event that ran for its second year in September, generated almost 1 billion views - up over 30% from last year. Beyond TV and movies, we’re coming up on the one year anniversary of our gaming launch. As we’ve said, this will be a multi-year journey for us to learn how to please game players. Our first year was about establishing our gaming infrastructure and understanding how our members interact with games. We now have 35 games on service (all included in every Netflix subscription without in-game ads or in-app purchases) and we’re seeing some encouraging signs of gameplay leading to higher retention. With 55 more games in development, including more games based on Netflix IP, we’re focused in the next few years on creating hit games that will take our game initiative to the next level. More generally, we see a big opportunity around content that crosses between TV or film and games. For example, after the launch of the anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (49 million hours viewed) in Q3 use of CD Projekt’s game surged on PCs. Product and Pricing As we’ve been discussing over the past few quarters, improving our pricing strategy is an important near-term focus. Last week, we announced that we’ll be launching an ad-supported subscription plan on November 1 in Canada and Mexico; November 3 in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the US; and November 10 in Spain. Cumulatively, these 12 markets account for ~$140 billion of brand advertising spend across TV and streaming, or over 75% of the global market . 5 To start, we’re keeping it simple by offering one low-priced ad plan – Basic with Ads – at a price that’s 20%-40% below our current starting price. So in the US, for example, Netflix will now start at $6.99 per month (compared to $9.99 today). The Basic with Ads plan will have ~5 minutes of advertising per hour, frequency capping and strong privacy protections. The reaction from advertisers so far has been extremely positive and we believe that more choice, especially for more price conscious consumers, will translate into meaningful incremental revenue and operating profit over time. That said, it’s still very early days and, since we’re keeping our existing plans ad-free, it will take us time to build up our membership base and the associated ad revenue. Finally, we’ve landed on a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing and we’ll begin rolling this out more broadly starting in early 2023. After listening to consumer feedback, we are going to offer the 5 Excluding China and Russia, where we don’t operate. 6 ability for borrowers to transfer their Netflix profile into their own account, and for sharers to manage their devices more easily and to create sub-accounts (“extra member”), if they want to pay for family or friends. In countries with our lower-priced ad-supported plan, we expect the profile transfer option for borrowers to be especially popular. Competition As we’ve long said, we operate in a highly competitive industry, where people have many different entertainment choices – from linear TV to streaming, YouTube to TikTok and gaming to social media. The silver lining is that the opportunity is very large and growing, and Netflix is still very small relative to that opportunity (for example, ~8% of total TV time in the US and the UK, two of our most established countries). In the 190 countries in which we operate, our $30 billion-plus of annual revenue is roughly 5% of the combined estimated ~$300 billion pay TV/streaming industry, ~$180 billion branded advertising market, and $130 billion consumers spend annually on gaming . So, we believe that we have 6 a long runway for growth if we can continue to improve our offering steadily over time. As it’s become clear that streaming is the future of entertainment, our competitors – including media companies and tech players – are investing billions of dollars to scale their new services. But it\\'s hard to build a large and profitable streaming business – our best estimate is that all of these competitors are losing money on streaming, with aggregate annual direct operating losses this year alone that could be well in excess of $10 billion, compared with our +$5-$6 billion of annual operating profit. For incumbent entertainment companies, this high level of investment is understandable given the accelerating decline of linear TV, which currently generates the bulk of their profit. Ultimately though, we believe some of our competitors will seek to build sustainable, profitable businesses in streaming - either on their own or through continued industry consolidation. While it’s early days, we’re starting to see this increased profit focus - with some raising prices for their streaming services, some reigning in content spending, and some retrenching around traditional operating models which may dilute their direct-to-consumer offering. Amidst this formidable, diverse set of competitors, we believe our focus as a pure-play streaming business is an advantage. Our aim remains to be the first choice in entertainment, and to continue to build an amazingly successful and profitable business. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $557 million vs. $82 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) amounted to $472 million, compared with -$106 million in Q3’21. We 7 continue to expect FCF of +$1 billion for the full year 2022, plus or minus a few hundred million dollars and substantial growth in FCF in 2023 (assuming no further material appreciation of the US dollar) . Gross debt at quarter end was $14 billion, within our $10-$15 billion target range. Cash increased $300 million sequentially to $6.1 billion. Net debt amounted to $7.9 billion at the end of Q3’22, or 1.2x LTM 7 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6 Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludes hardware sales. 7 EBITDA. We have no debt maturities in 2023. In early October, we closed our previously announced acquisition of leading animation studio Animal Logic. We funded the transaction with cash, which will be reflected in our Q4’22 cash flow statement. There’s no change to our capital allocation approach. Our first priority is to continue to invest appropriately in our business for the long term, including new initiatives such as games and advertising, followed by selective acquisitions. After that, excess cash above our minimum cash levels (equivalent to roughly two months of revenue) will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.

IR Contact: Spencer Wang VP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development 408 809-5360 PR Contact: Emily Feingold Director, Corporate Communications 323 287-0756 Use of Non-GAAP Measure This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of F/X neutral operating margin, free cash flow, last twelve months (“LTM”) EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F/X neutral operating margin allows investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currency fluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by 10 (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q4-18-Shareholder-Letter': \"Fellow shareholders,    We grew annual revenue 35% to $16 billion in 2018, and nearly doubled operating profits to $1.6 billion.  Fueling this growth was our high member satisfaction, which propelled us to finish 2018 with 139 million  paying memberships, up 9 million from quarter start and up 29 million from the beginning of the year.     Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast  Average paid memberships and ASP rose 26% and 3% year over year, respectively. Excluding the impact  of F/X, international ASP increased 6% year over year and 1% sequentially. Foreign exchange headwinds  continued to move against us in the quarter, similar to the trend we saw in Q3’18.  As expected, Q4 operating margin dipped to 5.2% vs. 7.5% prior year due to so many titles launching in  the quarter. Our full year 2018 operating margin of 10% was in-line with our target. EPS of $0.30 vs.  $0.41 included a $22 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro  denominated debt.  We added a record 8.8m paid memberships (1.5m in the US and 7.3m internationally), higher than our  beginning-of-quarter expectation for 7.6m paid net adds and up 33% year over year. For the full year,  paid net adds grew 33% to 29m vs. the 22m we added in 2017.   1    As discussed in our last letter, we \\u200breclassified\\u200b certain personnel costs from G&A to Cost of Revenues and  Marketing, and from Technology & Development to Other Cost of Revenues. This change has no impact  on operating profit or margin or total operating expenses and historical quarterly pro forma financial  statements for 2016-2018 can be found \\u200bhere\\u200b.   The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for  accuracy. For Q1’19, we forecast global paid net additions of 8.9m, +8% year over year, with 1.6m in the  US and 7.3m internationally. Our Q1’19 revenue forecast represents 21% year over year growth (27% FX  neutral). Our paid member growth is fairly consistent. Quarter to quarter, revenue growth varies due to  factors like FX changes and timing of price changes across different markets. For example, we forecast  Q1’19 international ASP will be up year over year, excluding FX.   We change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the  overall Netflix experience. We want to ensure that Netflix is a good value for the money and that our  entry price is affordable. We just increased our US prices for new members, as we did in Q4 in Canada  and Argentina, and in Japan in Q3. The new pricing in the US will be phased in for existing members over  Q1 and Q2, which we anticipate will lift ASP.  Our multi-year plan is to keep significantly growing our content while increasing our revenue faster to  expand our operating margins. We’re targeting a 9% operating margin in Q1’19, which we expect will  grow over the course of the year and our full year operating margin target for 2019 remains 13%  vs.  10% in 2018. A majority of our revenue is not in dollars, so when there are material FX moves, investors  know to expect proportionate top line changes. In such FX cases, we’ll seek to adjust our prices and  costs over time, but since that will lag the revenue changes, and since we don’t hedge FX, this would  lead to short-term margin variations from our steady progression.   2  Content  In its first 4 weeks on Netflix, we estimate that \\u200bBird Box \\u200bfrom director Susanne Bier will be enjoyed by  over 80 million member households, and we are seeing high repeat viewing. In combination with our  other movie hits such as: \\u200bDumplin’\\u200b from director Anne Fletcher, Chris Columbus-produced \\u200bThe Christmas  Chronicles\\u200b, Alfonso Cuarón’s critically acclaimed \\u200bROMA\\u200b, Paul Greengrass’ \\u200b22 July, \\u200bTamara Jenkins’  Private Life\\u200b  and the Coen brothers’ \\u200bThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\\u200b, we are beginning to have our \\u200boriginal  movie\\u200b offering mirror the success of our series offering for consumer enjoyment. The global reach of our  audience and the quality of the experience producing for Netflix continues to attract the world’s top  directors. We are expanding the film market: while our films drew bigger and bigger audiences in Q4,  the North American box office also set records. Today, five weeks after its Netflix debut, \\u200bROMA\\u200b is still  being exhibited in theaters and has played on over 900 unique screens around the world, including some  special 70mm format presentations. People love films...at home \\u200band\\u200b in theaters.   Around the world, our titles are not only pleasing consumers, but they are transforming the careers of  our talent. \\u200bElite\\u200b, our Spanish original, has been a huge success with over 20 million member households  around the world enjoying the series in its first four weeks on service . In addition to being highly  1 watched, social engagement has been phenomenal and the cast’s popularity on social media  skyrocketed, continuing to demonstrate our ability to be a launching pad for talent.    We’re making significant investments in productions all over the world because we have seen that great  stories transcend borders. For example, \\u200bBodyguard\\u200b (co-produced with BBC One, from ITV Studios) ranks  as one of our most enjoyed co-productions. \\u200bBaby\\u200b, our second original series from Italy, and \\u200bThe  1 For series, due to their highly variable length, we count a viewer if they substantially complete at least  one episode (70%).  For a film, it is if they substantially complete the film (70%).   3  Protector\\u200b, our first Turkish original series, both saw strong viewing both inside and outside their home  countries. All three of these debut seasons from around the world were each enjoyed by over 10 million  member households in their first four weeks.   From Hollywood, in Q4 we launched new global scripted series like \\u200bThe Haunting of Hill House\\u200b, \\u200bChilling  Adventures of Sabrina\\u200b, and \\u200bThe Kominsky Method\\u200b (from Chuck Lorre, starring Michael Douglas and Alan  Arkin), as well as new seasons of returning shows like adult animation \\u200bBig Mouth\\u200b and \\u200bNarcos: Mexico\\u200b,  the latest installment in the \\u200bNarcos\\u200b franchise. We were very pleased with our launch of \\u200bYou\\u200b three weeks  ago; we estimate it will be watched by over 40 million member households in its first 4 weeks on Netflix.  This binge-worthy show started as a Lifetime linear series in the US, but is now a full Netflix global  original. A week ago, we launched \\u200bSex Education\\u200b from the UK and it is also tracking to be a huge hit  (estimated over 40 million households watching the title within the first 4 weeks).   Netflix films and TV shows picked up \\u200bfive 2019 Golden Globe wins\\u200b, including Best Comedy Series for \\u200bThe  Kominsky Method \\u200band Best Actor in a Comedy Series for Michael Douglas and Best Actor in a Drama  Series for Richard Madden from \\u200bBodyguard.\\u200b Alfonso Cuarón won the Golden Globe for Best Feature  Director and Best Foreign Language Feature for \\u200bROMA\\u200b.   As a result of our success with original content, we’re becoming less focused on 2nd run programming.  For example, we launched our originals strategy for the unscripted genre only two years ago. Today,  Netflix originals, like \\u200bTidying Up with Marie Kondo\\u200b, account for a majority of total unscripted view share  on Netflix, while viewing of all unscripted programming has increased meaningfully during that time. We  are ready to pay top-of-market prices for second run content when the studios, networks and producers  are willing to sell, but we are also prepared to keep our members ecstatic with our incredible original  content if others choose to retain their content for their own services.   Looking forward in 2019, we will be launching many new highly-anticipated titles including \\u200bThe Umbrella  Academy\\u200b (February 15th); \\u200bTriple Frontier \\u200bfrom J.C. Chandor (March); \\u200bThe Irishman\\u200b from Martin Scorsese;  6 Underground\\u200b from Michael Bay; and \\u200bThe Politician\\u200b from Ryan Murphy; as well as returning seasons of  The Crown\\u200b led by a new cast including Olivia Colman, Ben Daniels, and Helena Bonham Carter; \\u200b13  Reasons Why, La Casa de Papel, Elite\\u200b, and, of course, Season 3 of the epic \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b, coming to  members all around the world on July 4th.  Product and Partnerships  We test many different approaches to our business in order to learn how to grow quickly. We continue  to test new plan options (both below and above our existing offers) in certain markets. We are also  expanding our bundled offerings which now include: Telefonica in Spain, Comcast and T-Mobile in the  US, Sky in the UK and Germany, Free in France, and KDDI in Japan. As discussed in our Q1’18 investor  letter, in the case of these hard bundles, we report revenue net of economics we share with our  partners.  On December 28, we released \\u200bBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\\u200b, our first interactive movie for adults,  allowing viewers to make decisions on behalf of the lead character. We’ve created thousands of  different pathways to make it through the story, including multiple endings. This level of complexity  4  necessitated the creation of a system to make such storytelling manageable. “Branch Manager” helped  series creator and writer Charlie Brooker and our internal teams produce this popular multi-branched  movie. We’ll be using Branch Manager to construct additional interactive projects going forward. We’re  thrilled with the global excitement that \\u200bBandersnatch \\u200bhas created and it serves as a strong example of  how we can marry technology and entertainment to evolve video storytelling.   Competition  In the US, we earn around 10% of television screen time  and less than that of mobile screen time. In  2 other countries, we earn a lower percentage of screen time due to lower penetration of our service. We  earn consumer screen time, both mobile and television, away from a very broad set of competitors.  We  compete with (and lose to) \\u200bFortnite\\u200b more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few  minutes in October, our viewing and signups spiked for that time. Hulu is small compared to YouTube for  viewing time, and they are successful in the US, but non-existent in Canada, which creates a comparison  point: our penetration in the two countries is pretty similar. There are thousands of competitors in this  highly-fragmented market vying to entertain consumers and low barriers to entry for those with great  experiences. Our growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen time  experiences from which consumers choose. Our focus is not on Disney+, Amazon or others, but on how  we can improve our experience for our members.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow in Q4’18 was -$1.3 billion vs. -$0.5 billion in Q4’17, totalling -$3 billion for 2018  (compared to our original forecasted range of -$3 to -$4 billion for the full year).  We expect 2019 FCF  will be similar to 2018 and then will improve each year thereafter (assuming, as we do, no material  transactions). This FCF improvement will be driven by growing operating margin, which will allow us to  fund more of our investment needs internally.   During Q4, we raised €1.1 billion 4.625% senior notes and $800 million 6.375% senior notes (weighted  average coupon of 5.3%). As long as we judge our marginal after-tax cost of debt to be lower than our  marginal cost of equity, we’ll continue to finance our working capital needs through the high yield  market. We finished the year with cash of $3.8 billion and our $500 million unsecured credit facility  remains undrawn.   Spence Neumann joins as CFO   We’re pleased that Spence Neumann has joined Netflix as our new CFO and we thank David Wells for his  many contributions to Netflix. Spence is a veteran entertainment executive who brings a wealth of  experience and new perspectives to the company as we expand our original content around the world.     2 We serve on average about 100 million hours a day to television screens in the US, and we estimate  television screens in the US are on about a billion hours daily (120m homes x 2 TVs x 4 hours, plus  hotels, bars, etc).   5  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bOctober 2018\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2018\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2018\\u200b,  January 2018\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2017\\u200b,  \\u200bJuly 2017\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2017\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2017\\u200b.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  6  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding content investment; multi-year business plan; content  performance; price changes; reliance on 2\\u200bnd\\u200b run programming; future content offerings, including  interactive projects; partnerships; effect of competition on growth; free cash flow; future capital raises;  domestic and international net and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution  margin for both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating  margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including,  without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to  compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in  consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of internet service  providers; changes in government regulation; and, competition, including consumer adoption of  different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such  forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the Securities and  Exchange Commission on February 5, 2018. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors  should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A. We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.  7      8 Netflix, Inc.

       " 'FINAL-Q4-19-Shareholder-Letter': 'Fellow shareholders,  We had a strong finish to 2019, with Q4 revenue growing 31% year over year, bringing full year 2019  revenue to over $20 billion, while FY19 operating income rose 62% to $2.6 billion. During the quarter,  we surpassed 100 million paid memberships outside of the US. Streaming entertainment is a global  phenomenon and we’re working hard to build on our early progress.     Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast  In Q4, average streaming paid memberships grew 21% year over year while streaming ARPU increased  9% year over year. Excluding a -$133 million impact from foreign currency, streaming ARPU rose 12%  year over year. Operating income in Q4 amounted to $459m (vs. $216m last year). While this was  slightly lower than our beginning-of-quarter forecast of $475m, we’re primarily managing by our full  year operating margin target, which we met (13% in FY19 vs. 10% in FY18).   EPS for Q4 amounted to $1.30 vs. $0.30 a year ago. During Q4, the US Treasury issued final regulations  on certain aspects of the 2017 US tax reform. As a result, we had over-accrued in the first three quarters  of 2019 for tax, which was adjusted in Q4, resulting in our n\\u200bet income being higher than operating  income this quarter. We paid US corporate taxes for the full year inclusive of this Q4 adjustment.   1  Global paid net additions totaled 8.8m in Q4, on par with the 8.8m in the prior year period and ahead of  our forecast of 7.6m, fueled by our broad slate of original programming and the worldwide adoption of  streaming video. We generated Q4-record paid net adds in each of the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions,  while UCAN paid net adds totaled 0.55m (with 0.42m in the US) vs. 1.75m in the year ago quarter. Our  low membership growth in UCAN is probably due to our recent price changes and to US competitive  launches. We have seen more muted impact from competitive launches outside the US (NL, CA, AU). As  always, we are working hard to improve our service to combat these factors and push net adds higher  over time.     As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.  For Q1’20, we forecast global paid net adds of 7.0m vs. 9.6m in Q1’19, which was an all-time high in  quarterly paid net adds. Our Q1’20 forecast reflects the continued, slightly elevated churn levels we are  seeing in the US plus an expectation for more balanced paid net adds across Q1 and Q2 this year, with  seasonality more similar to 2018 than 2019. This is due in part to the timing of last year’s price changes  and a strong upcoming Q2 content slate, where we’ll have some of our bigger titles like \\u200bLa Casa De Papel  (aka \\u200bMoney Heist\\u200b) season 4.   We’re targeting a 16% operating margin in 2020 (up 300 basis points year over year). As a reminder,  large swings in foreign exchange (F/X) could lead to some temporary variations from our annual margin  progression, partially because we don’t spend on derivatives to hedge our F/X exposure and about half  of our revenue is not in US dollars.  Content  Great content grows engagement among our members, which we believe drives word-of-mouth,  improves retention and grows paid memberships. We have many exciting releases for Q1’20 including  2  returning seasons of \\u200bSex Education\\u200b,\\u200b Altered Carbon\\u200b, \\u200bNarcos: Mexico\\u200b, the Spanish series \\u200bElite\\u200b and Korean  historical zombie thriller \\u200bKingdom,\\u200b as well as action film \\u200bSpenser Confidential\\u200b (starring Mark Wahlberg)  and the movie sequel \\u200bTo All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You\\u200b. New original series include the recently  released \\u200bMessiah\\u200b and the buzzy docu-series \\u200bKiller Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez\\u200b and the  upcoming \\u200bI Am Not Okay with This.  These titles build off of a highly successful Q4 content slate, which included new seasons of \\u200bThe Crown,  Big Mouth\\u200b and \\u200bYou\\u200b and new series and films like \\u200bRhythm & Flow\\u200b, \\u200bAmerican Son\\u200b, Turkish series \\u200bThe Gift  and French film \\u200bBanlieusards \\u200b(aka \\u200bStreet Flow\\u200b). The psychological thriller \\u200bYou\\u200b, which originated on US  linear TV with a modest audience, has evolved into a global phenomenon on Netflix; we estimate, based  on the first few weeks, 54m member households will choose to watch season 2 in its first 4 weeks. In its  first four weeks, over 21m member households have chosen to watch season 3 of \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b (up over  40% from Season 2 over the same time period) and in total, over 73m households worldwide have  chosen \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b since the series launched. \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b and the all new Season 3 cast just won the  Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama series and star Olivia Colman won the Golden  Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series.   During December, we also launched \\u200bThe Witcher\\u200b, which is tracking to be \\u200bour biggest season one TV  series ever\\u200b. Through its first four weeks of release, 76m member households chose to watch this  action-packed fantasy, starring Henry Cavill. As a testament to how our hit content can penetrate the  global zeitgeist and influence popular culture, the show’s launch drove up sales of \\u200bThe Witcher\\u200b \\u200bbooks  and \\u200bgames\\u200b around the world, and spawned a viral musical \\u200bhit\\u200b.   Our Q4 movie slate set a new bar for the variety and high quality of films we produce to appeal to our  members’ many different tastes. We released \\u200b6 Underground\\u200b, from director Michael Bay and starring  Ryan Reynolds, and 83m member households chose this crowd-pleasing action film through its first four  weeks. The exceptional breadth and quality of our film slate was recognized as we led all studios with 24  Academy Award nominations across eight different films. The nominated feature films produced by the  Netflix studio like \\u200bThe Irishman\\u200b, \\u200bMarriage Story\\u200b and \\u200bThe Two Popes \\u200bwere also very popular with our  members. Having launched our original film initiative just under five years ago, this is a proud  achievement and a testament to the creative talent with whom we partner\\u200b.   Across both film and TV, we were also recognized for being the home for storytellers and creators from  many diverse backgrounds. We’re honored to lead the industry in nominations at both the \\u200bNAACP Image  Awards\\u200b (42 nominations) and the \\u200bGLAAD Media Awards\\u200b (15 nominations).   We know that local audiences love local stories. In fact, local originals were the most popular 2019 titles  in many countries, including India, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Thailand, Sweden and the UK. In addition,  we\\'ve seen how members all around the world also love these stories with \\u200bLa Casa de Papel/Money  Heist\\u200b appearing on our top ten lists in more than 70 countries. K-content is also popular globally, and  we\\'re investing heavily in Korean stories. In this past quarter, we inked a TV output deal with JTBC, a  leading Korean media company, and a strategic partnership with CJ ENM’s Studio Dragon, Korea’s  largest TV studio. These deals will enable us to bring more K-dramas to fans all over the world.  3  Over the past several years, we’ve been developing an animation studio within Netflix to produce a wide  array of animated content for kids, adults and families. We have amazing creators with pedigree from  Disney Animation, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation and Illumination now working at Netflix on their next  big projects. In Q4, we debuted filmmaker Sergio Pablos’ \\u200bKlaus\\u200b, our first original feature-length  animated film that was also nominated for an Academy Award. In its first 28 days, 40m members chose  to watch this heartwarming Santa Claus origin story. Later in 2020, we’ll premiere the ambitious \\u200bOver  The Moon\\u200b, from legendary animator Glen Keane, followed by a schedule that builds to several big  animated feature films per year.  As we’ve expanded our original content, we’ve been working on how to best share content highlights  that demonstrate popularity. Given that we now have titles with widely varying lengths - from short  episodes (e.g. \\u200bSpecial\\u200b at around 15 minutes) to long films (e.g. \\u200bThe Highwaymen\\u200b at 132 minutes), we  believe that reporting households viewing a title based on 70% of a single episode of a series or of an  entire film, which we have been doing, makes less sense. We are now reporting on households  (accounts) that chose to watch a given title . Our new methodology is similar to the BBC iPlayer in their  1 rankings\\u200b based on “requests” for the title, “most popular” articles on the New York Times which include  those who opened the articles, and YouTube view counts. This way, short and long titles are treated  equally, leveling the playing field for all types of our content including interactive content, which has no  fixed length. The new metric is about 35% higher on average than the prior metric. For example, 45m  member households chose to watch \\u200bOur Planet\\u200b under the new metric vs. 33m under the prior metric.  Product and Partnerships  In Product, we are investing our resources to grow engagement and our storytelling capabilities (like the  branching narratives in \\u200bBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\\u200b), deepen our penetration in key markets and help  our members find great content through better suggestions. To do this, we try many approaches; in  2019 alone, we conducted hundreds of product tests to try to improve our member experience from  sign up to billing and payments to content discovery. About 30% of these led to a gain in retention,  engagement or revenue, up from 20% in the prior year. It’s a humbling exercise as so many of our ideas  do not “win” with members, but this helps tune our judgment and innovation priorities for the future.   In Q4, we launched a mobile-only plan in Malaysia and Indonesia (which we introduced to India in Q3  last year). We’ve seen similar results with this plan driving incremental subscriber growth and improving  retention. We expect the mobile-only plan to be revenue-positive which will allow us to further invest in  content to be enjoyed by our members and continue to feed the virtuous cycle. We plan to continue to  test adding this plan, as well as additional ideas in other countries around the world.  Competition   Many media companies and tech giants are launching streaming services, reinforcing the major trend of  the transition from linear to streaming entertainment. This is happening all over the world and is still in  its early stages, leaving ample room for many services to grow as linear TV wanes. We have a big  1 Chose to watch and did watch for at least 2 minutes -- long enough to indicate the choice was intentional  -- is the precise definition   4  headstart in streaming and will work to build on that by focusing on the same thing we have focused on  for the past 22 years - pleasing members. We believe if we do that well, Netflix will continue to prosper.  As an example, in Q4, despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per  membership grew both globally and in the US on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters.  Below is a comparison of \\u200bGoogle search trends\\u200b for \\u200bThe Witcher\\u200b, Disney’s \\u200bThe Mandalorian\\u200b, Amazon’s  Jack Ryan\\u200b and Apple’s \\u200bThe Morning Show\\u200b.    Disney+ were global we don’t think the picture would be much different, to judge from the \\u200bNL results\\u200b where Disney+ first launched.   Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q4, net cash used in operating activities was -$1.5 billion vs. -$1.2 billion in the prior year period. Free  cash flow (FCF)  in Q4 totaled -$1.7 billion vs. -$1.3 billion in Q4’18. For the full year, FCF was -$3.3  2 billion which we believe is the peak in our annual FCF deficit.   Our plan is to continually improve FCF each year and to move slowly toward FCF positive. For 2020, we  currently forecast FCF of approximately -$2.5 billion. Along the way, we’ll continue to use the debt  market to finance our investment needs as we did in Q4’19, when we raised $1.0 billion 4.875% senior  notes and €1.1 billion 3.625% senior notes, both due in 2030. With our FCF profile improving, this means  that over time we’ll be less reliant on public markets and will be able to fund more of our investment  needs organically through our growing operating profits.   2 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash (used in) operating activities, please refer to the  reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto.  5    Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bOctober 2019\\u200b,  \\u200bJuly 2019\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2019\\u200b,  January 2019\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2018\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2018\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2018\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2018\\u200b.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    VP, Finance/IR & Corporate Development    408 809-5360      PR Contact:    Richard Siklos  VP,  Communications     408 540-2629     Use of Non-GAAP Measures\\xa0 This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free  cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding global paid net additions; churn; seasonality;;  distribution of net adds across quarters; full-year operating margin target; future content offerings;  product tests; revenue impact of product changes; future capital raises; reliance on public markets for  cash needs; impact of competition; global streaming paid memberships and growth; consolidated  revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and  peak free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract  new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and  expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service  disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including  consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion  of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially  from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange  8  Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (“SEC”) on January 29, 2019, as amended by Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on February 8,  2019. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual  performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above  and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A. We undertake no obligation to  update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.        9  Netflix,�Inc.�

       " 'FINAL-Q4-21-Shareholder-Letter': 'We achieved several milestones in 2021: we had the biggest TV show of the year (Squid Game), our two biggest film releases of all time (Red Notice and Don’t Look Up) and Netflix was the most Emmy-winning and most nominated TV network and the most Oscar-winning and nominated movie studio of 2021. Full year revenue of $30 billion grew 19% year over year while operating income of $6.2 billion rose 35% year over year. We finished Q4 with 222m paid memberships (with 8.3m paid net adds in Q4). Even in a world of uncertainty and increasing competition, we’re optimistic about our long-term growth prospects as streaming supplants linear entertainment around the world. We\\'re continually improving Netflix so that we can please our members, grow our share of leisure time and lead in this transition. Our summary results and forecast are below. Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast Revenue in Q4’21 grew 16% year over year with a 9% increase in average paid memberships. ARM rose 1 7% year over year on both a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, two percentage points faster than Q3’21 (ex-F/X). Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 8%, a six percentage point decrease vs. the year ago period. The decline in operating margin was expected given our large content slate in Q4 this year. Operating margin was above our beginning of quarter forecast of 6.5% due to slightly lower than forecasted content spend. As a result, our full year operating margin was 21% vs. 18% in 2020, 1 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 above our 20% guidance forecast. EPS in Q4 of $1.33 vs. $1.19 a year ago included a $104m non-cash unrealized gain from FX remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. We slightly over-forecasted paid net adds in Q4 (8.3m actual compared to the 8.5m paid net adds in both the year ago quarter and our beginning of quarter projection). For the full year 2021, paid net adds totaled 18m vs 37m in 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with more than 90% of our paid net adds in 2021 coming from outside the UCAN region. Nonetheless, our UCAN region added 1.2m paid memberships in Q4’21 (vs. 0.9m last year), marking our strongest quarter of member growth in this region since the early days of COVID-19 in 2020. In APAC, we increased paid memberships by 2.6m (vs. 2.0m in the year ago quarter) with strong growth in both Japan and India. EMEA was our largest contributor to paid net adds in Q4 (3.5m vs. 4.5m in the prior year period) and the region delivered record quarterly revenue, exceeding $2.5 billion for the first time. LATAM paid net adds totaled 1.0m vs. 1.2m last year. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. That means in some quarters our results will be high relative to our guidance forecast and in others it will be low, as can be seen in the chart below. As our membership base continues to grow, there will naturally be more volatility in our absolute paid net adds performance vs. forecast. For Q1’22, we forecast paid net adds of 2.5m vs. 4.0m in the year ago quarter. Our guidance reflects a more back-end weighted content slate in Q1’22 (for example, Bridgerton S2 and our new original film The Adam Project will both be launching in March). In addition, while retention and engagement remain healthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels. We think this may be due to several factors including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts of the world like LATAM. 2 For 2022, we are currently targeting an operating margin of 19%-20% (assuming no material swings in foreign currency from current levels). Our operating margin outlook is driven by two main factors. First, as seen in the chart below, we delivered above the three percentage point annual linear progression over the past two years (average of four percentage points per year). Second, the US dollar has strengthened meaningfully against most other currencies. With ~60% of our revenue outside of the US due to our international success, we estimate that the US dollar’s appreciation over the past six months has cost us roughly $1 billion in expected 2022 revenue (as a reminder, we don’t hedge). With the vast majority of our expenses in US dollars, this translates into an estimated two percentage point negative impact on our 2022 operating margin. As we have written in the past, over the medium term we believe we can adjust our pricing and cost structure for a stronger US dollar world. In the near term, we want to continue to invest appropriately in our business and don’t want to over-react to F/X fluctuations to the detriment of our long term growth. There is no change to our goal of steadily growing our operating margin at an average increase of three percentage points per year over any few year period. 3 Content Our Q4 content slate epitomizes what we strive for: a wide variety of quality TV series and films. We had a number of big hits in Q4. We released new seasons of returning shows like The Witcher (484 million hours viewed ), You (468m hours viewed), Emily in Paris (287 million hours viewed) and on December 31, 2 Cobra Kai (274m hours viewed*), as well as the critically acclaimed limited series Maid (469m hours viewed). The dystopian Korean thriller Squid Game - a late Q3 release that broke through globally early in Q4 - generated 1.65 billion hours viewed in its first four weeks and is now our biggest TV season ever. The fourth quarter also featured the conclusion to one of our most popular shows - La Casa de Papel aka Money Heist (6.7 billion hours viewed over its lifetime). We’re excited to expand the LCDP universe with our Korean adaptation, Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area, launching later this year. Over the years, we’ve learned that big hits can come from anywhere in the world (with great subtitles and dubbing), as we’ve seen with La Casa de Papel, Squid Game, and Lupin to name just a few. But our goal with non-English originals is to first and foremost thrill audiences in their home country. And in the quarter, we saw big local viewing for titles such as Love is Blind Brazil, My Name from Korea, super hero film Minnal Murali from India and Danish thriller The Chestnut Man. Film is incredibly important for our members, which is why our ambition has always been to work with the world’s best filmmakers and stars to create a wide variety of quality movies. We took a large step forward in Q4 on this front with our biggest film slate ever. Our blockbuster Red Notice (starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds) quickly became our most popular movie launch of all-time with 364 million hours viewed in its first four weeks. Other hits this quarter include The Unforgivable, starring 2 Hours viewed data is based on the first 28 days of release. For titles released less than 28 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through January 18, 2022. As a reminder, we publish weekly our top titles based on hours viewed at Netflix Top 10. 4 Sandra Bullock (215m hours viewed), Army of the Dead prequel Army of Thieves (158m hours viewed), feel-good holiday romcom Love Hard with Jimmy O. Yang and Nina Dobrev (134m hours viewed), animated feature Back to the Outback (105m hours viewed) and The Harder They Fall (122m hours viewed). On Christmas Eve, we released the star-studded satire Don’t Look Up (featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry and Meryl Streep), which is already our second most popular film ever with 353m* hours viewed. Overall in 2021, Netflix series accounted for six out of the 10 most searched shows globally while our films represented two of the top 10. Google Year in Search, 2021 (Global) In November we debuted our mobile games experience globally on Android and iOS. Members can now discover and launch games from within the Netflix mobile app. Since launch, we released an additional five games, bringing the total to ten for 2021. It’s still very early days but we’re pleased with our progress. In 2022, we’ll expand our portfolio of games across both casual and core gaming genres as we continue to program a breadth of game types to learn what our members enjoy most. Marketing & Communications One of our goals with marketing is to help drive conversation about and passion for our titles. We know that Netflix fans want to dive deeper into what they watch with behind-the-scenes details, interviews, and updates. To make it easier and more engaging for our fans, we’ve launched the site Tudum (named after our “sonic logo”) as a home for extending stories and conversation and further building fandom for our TV shows and films. Product & Pricing Netflix offers a wide variety of TV shows and films to its members, which we know they value. We also work hard to make it easy for members to access this content. For instance, in October, we introduced voice-driven Play Something, first on Amazon Fire TV devices (TVs, sticks, and set top boxes). Now, members can simply say “Play Something on Netflix” or “Play a movie on Netflix” and playback will start 5 regardless of whether you are browsing Netflix or another service. If they don’t like what’s playing, simply saying “play something else” or “next” will play the next title in the list. Voice-driven Play Something makes choosing effectively effortless. In December, we lowered our prices in India across all four plans. India is fairly unique because pay TV pricing is very low. We believe these new prices will make Netflix more accessible to a broader swath of the population - strengthening our value perception. Our goal is to maximize long term revenue in each of our markets. Competition Consumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time - competition that has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering. While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth some, we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched. This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition from linear to streaming and that with under 10% of total TV screen time in the US, our biggest market, Netflix has tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$403 million vs. -$138 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was -$569 million vs. -$284 million in Q4‘20. For the full year 3 2021, FCF amounted to -$159 million, in-line with our expectation for “approximately break-even.” We didn’t engage in share repurchases in Q4 as we funded our acquisition of the Roald Dahl Story Company from cash on hand during the quarter. We anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, we prioritize our cash to reinvest in our core business and to fund new growth opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We’re also targeting $10-$15 billion of gross debt. We finished Q4 with gross debt of $15.5 billion and we’ll pay down $700 million of our senior notes due in Q1’22. After satisfying those uses of cash, excess cash above our minimum cash levels will be returned to shareholders via stock repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) While our current governance structure has served our shareholders extraordinarily well with a sustained period of substantial growth, we’ve clearly proven our business model: streaming is now an established business, we’re self-funding and expect sustained positive free cash flow, and we’ve substantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margin. So the Netflix Board has decided to evolve to a more standard large-cap governance structure and will recommend several changes at our 3 For a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, please refer to the reconciliation in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements and the footnotes thereto. 6 next annual meeting. These include declassifying our board, removing supermajority voting provisions in our charter and bylaws, and enabling shareholders to call special meetings. We will also change the voting standard for our directors in uncontested elections. Long Term Stock Price Performance In each January investor letter, we provide an update on our long term stock performance. We continue to manage our business for the long term and under the belief that pleasing our members will lead to strong value creation for our fellow shareholders. We thank our equity and debt investors for their trust and for coming along with us on our journey to build one of the world’s leading entertainment companies.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.

       " 'FINAL-Q4-22-Shareholder-Letter': 'Summary:  Q4’22 revenue, operating profit and membership growth exceeded our forecast - we continue to lead the industry in streaming engagement, revenue and profit.  Our Q4 content slate outperformed even our high expectations: ○ Wednesday was our third most popular series ever, Harry & Meghan our second most popular documentary series, Troll our most popular non-English film, and Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery our fourth most popular film . 1  We successfully launched our new, lower priced ad-supported plan in November and are pleased with the early results, with much more still to do.  We delivered on the high end of our operating profit margin target for full year 2022, and we expect to increase our operating margin in 2023 vs. 2022.  For 2022, we finished with 231M paid memberships and generated $32B of revenue, $5.6B in operating income, $2.0B of net cash from operating activities and $1.6B of free cash flow (FCF). In 2023, we expect at least $3B of FCF, assuming no material swings in F/X.  Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters are now co-CEOs of Netflix, with Reed Hastings as Executive Chairman – completing our succession process. 2022 was a tough year, with a bumpy start but a brighter finish. We believe we have a clear path to reaccelerate our revenue growth: continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix, launching paid sharing and building our ads offering. As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building even greater profitability over time. 1 As defined by cumulative view hours in the first 28 days 1 Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters as our co-CEOs To complete our succession process, Reed Hastings has become Executive Chairman, and Greg Peters has stepped up from COO to become Ted Sarandos’ co-CEO, and a member of the Netflix board. Reed, Greg, and Ted have been working closely together for 15 years, and this makes formal externally how we have been operating internally. More details are here on our blog. Ted said: “I want to thank Reed for his visionary leadership, mentorship and friendship over the last 20 years. We’ve all learned so much from his intellectual rigor, honesty and willingness to take big bets – and we look forward to working with him for many more years to come. Since Reed started to delegate management to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values and like-minded approach to growth. I am so excited to start this new chapter with Greg as co-CEO.” Greg said: \"I feel humbled and privileged to become co-CEO of Netflix. Ted and I have worked together for many years – building tremendous trust and respect for each other. We\\'re also motivated by the same goal: a desire to better serve our members so that we can continue to grow our business.” In addition to these changes, Bela Bajaria, formerly Head of Global TV, has become Chief Content Officer and Scott Stuber has become Chairman of Netflix Film. Ted said: “Bela and Scott are outstanding creative executives with proven track records at Netflix. In 2022 we premiered many of our most popular series and films in Netflix history, including Wednesday, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Purple Hearts, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, The Adam Project and Harry & Meghan – a testament to their leadership and creativity. I couldn’t be more excited to work alongside them as we seek to delight audiences for years to come.” For full details of Netflix leadership see here. Q4 Results Year over year revenue growth of 2% in Q4 (10% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis ) was driven 2 by a 4% increase in average paid memberships. ARM declined 2% year over year, but grew 5% on a F/X 3 neutral basis2. Revenue was slightly above our beginning-of-quarter projection, as paid net adds of 7.7M (vs. 8.3M in Q4’21) came in higher than our 4.5M forecast, due to both strong acquisition and retention, driven primarily by the success of our Q4 content slate. In addition, the US dollar depreciated vs. most other currencies during the quarter, which resulted in slightly higher than projected ARM. Operating income of $550M in Q4 was down vs. $632M in Q4 ‘21. This was above our guidance forecast of $330M primarily due to higher than expected revenue as well as slower-than-forecasted hiring. Operating margin for Q4 amounted to 7% compared to 8% in Q4’21. This year over year decline was due to the appreciation of the US dollar. For the full year 2022, our operating margin amounted to 18% vs. 3 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 2 Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchange rate movements. Assumes foreign exchange rates remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. 2 21% in FY21. Based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022 and excluding the $150M in restructuring charges in Q2’22, this translates into an operating margin of 20%, at the high end of the 19%-20% target we set in January of 2022. F/X Neutral Operating Margin (Excluding Restructuring Charges in Q2 2022) * Based on F/X rates at the beginning of each year (and excluding the $150M of restructuring costs in Q2 2022). Note: Excludes F/X impact on content amortization, as titles are amortized at a historical blended rate based on timing of spend. EPS in Q4’22 was $0.12 vs. $1.33 in Q4‘21. This was below our $0.36 forecast due to a $462M non-cash unrealized loss from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt as a result of the depreciation of the US dollar vs. the Euro during Q4’22. As a reminder, our approximately $5B of Euro bonds provides us with some natural hedge on the relative value of the Euro for net income. However, it doesn’t affect operating income as unrealized gains or losses are recognized below operating income in “interest and other income.” For the full year, we recognized a non-cash unrealized gain of $353M from the F/X remeasurement on our Euro bonds. Forecast As we noted in our Q3’22 shareholder letter, revenue is our primary top line metric, particularly as we develop additional revenue streams where membership is just one component of our growth (like advertising and paid sharing). The quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. As always, we strive for accuracy although the rollout of major new initiatives (paid sharing and ads) plus current uncertain macroeconomic environment leads to less-than-normal visibility. We forecast Q1’23 revenue growth of 4% (8% on a F/X neutral basis). We expect our F/X neutral revenue growth to be driven by a combination of year over year growth in average paid memberships and ARM. This translates into modest positive paid net adds in Q1 ‘23 (vs. paid net adds of -0.2M in Q1’22). Our 3 expectation of fewer paid net adds in Q1’23 vs. Q4’22 is consistent with normal seasonality and factors in our strong member growth in Q4’22, which likely pulled forward some growth from Q1’23. In addition, we expect to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1’23 (more details below in the Product and Pricing section). We anticipate that this will result in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2’23 than in Q1’23. From our experience in Latin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing, which impacts near term member growth. But as borrower households begin to activate their own standalone accounts and extra member accounts are added, we expect to see improved overall revenue, which is our goal with all plan and pricing changes. Our long term financial objectives remain unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expand operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. For the full year 2023, as we continue to improve our service, grow our advertising business and launch paid sharing, we expect constant currency revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. We also expect year over year operating profit growth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F/X). We have been targeting a FY23 operating margin of 19%-20% based on F/X rates at the beginning of 2022. We now expect to deliver roughly 21%-22% operating margin on this basis (above the 19%-20% range). Rolling forward to F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, this translates into a FY23 operating margin target of 18%-20%. For Q1’23, we expect operating margin to be down year over year (20% vs. 25%) due primarily to the timing of content spend. Content and Marketing People have more choice of films and TV shows than ever so we need to ensure that there’s always something great for them to watch on Netflix, regardless of their taste, mood, or who they’re watching with. It’s why we’re so focused on continuing to improve our content and broaden our slate. 2022\\'s successful slate was the result of having the best creative executives working with best in class creators. Last year alone we launched : 4  Five of our Top 10 most popular English language TV seasons ever – Stranger Things 4 and Wednesday (both of which hit 1B hours viewed), Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, Bridgerton S2 and Inventing Anna – as well as Harry & Meghan, our second most successful doc series ever;  Four of our Top 10 most popular English language films ever –The Adam Project, The Gray Man, Purple Hearts and Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery – as well as The Sea Beast and The Tinder Swindler, our most successful animated and documentary films respectively;  Seven of our Top 10 most popular non-English films ever – Troll (Norway), All Quiet on the Western Front (Germany), Black Crab (Sweden), Through My Window (Spain), The Takedown (France), My Name is Vendetta (Italy), and Loving Adults (Denmark);  Two of our Top 10 most popular non-English TV shows ever – All of Us Are Dead and Extraordinary Attorney Woo, both from Korea. 4 For View Hours for these titles, please visit Netflix Top 10. 4 We’re also pleased with the progress we’ve made with returning titles. Members watched more Netflix returning seasons and sequels in 2022 than ever before across a broad range of genres – from film (Enola Holmes 2, Lost Bullet 2 and two 365 Days sequels) and unscripted (Selling Sunset S5 and Love is Blind S3) to award winning drama (Ozark S4 and The Crown S5), local language series (Sintonia S3, Young Royals S2 and Alice in Borderland S2, whose success pushed S1 back into the Top 10 after its launch) and animation (Big Mouth S6). It’s hard to think of two titles that more successfully pierced the zeitgeist this year than Stranger Things 4 and Wednesday. Both pushed old songs into the music charts: Kate Bush’s Running Up That Hill went to number 1 on Billboard’s Global charts for the first time, 37 years after it was first released, and Lady Gaga’s Bloody Mary made it onto the Billboard top 40 list for the first time ever, 11 years after it was first released. We get amazing results when we have a Wednesday, Glass Onion or Monster moment with our members. We believe people typically sign up for a streaming service because they’ve heard about a title “you simply must watch” from a friend, seen the excitement on social media or read about it in the press. Generating conversation is our primary marketing goal because we see that it drives acquisition and encourages existing members to watch more, which in turn helps with retention. For Ryan Murphy’s The Watcher, conversation about the series led to fans flocking to the house, a Saturday Night Live spoof and a spike in home security sales. Our Wednesday campaign, with all our marketing in Wednesday’s iconic voice, generated 1.5B organic social impressions pre-launch, a record for a Netflix season one. Over time, we hope to have more and more of these moments across film and TV, and to replicate these successes on the games side. It’s now slightly over a year since we launched games on the Netflix service. We’ve made good progress in that time - creating the infrastructure to deliver games to mobile devices, building a portfolio of 50 games across many genres and acquiring four game studios to bolster our internal production capabilities. In Q4, we launched season four of unscripted series Too Hot to Handle, which was a top 10 title for us globally for three consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, we debuted our Too Hot to Handle game, which has been our biggest game launch to date and is another encouraging sign in the long term opportunity to entertain members with Netflix intellectual property (IP) across different mediums. In 2023, we’ll continue to expand our offering with more games, with a focus on Netflix-related IP. Product and Pricing As discussed over the past few quarters, we’re working to give people more choice when it comes to price as well as greater control over their Netflix account. In November, we successfully launched our new, lower priced ad-supported plan in 12 countries. We believe branded television advertising is a substantial long term incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Netflix, and our ability to stand up this business in six months underscores our commitment both to give members more choice and to reaccelerate our growth. While it’s still early days for ads and we have lots to do (in particular better targeting and measurement), we are pleased with our progress to date across every dimension: member experience, value to advertisers, and incremental contribution to our business. Engagement, which is consistent with members on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected and we believe the lower 5 price point is driving incremental membership growth. Also, as expected, we’ve seen very little switching from other plans. Overall the reaction to this launch from both consumers and advertisers has confirmed our belief that our ad-supported plan has strong unit economics (at minimum, in-line with or better than the comparable ad-free plan) and will generate incremental revenue and profit, though the impact on 2023 will be modest given that this will build slowly over time. Later in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business. While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change for members who share their account more broadly. So we’ve worked hard to build additional new features that improve the Netflix experience, including the ability for members to review which devices are using their account and to transfer a profile to a new account. As we roll out paid sharing, members in many countries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t live with. As is the case today, all members will be able to watch while traveling, whether on a TV or mobile device. As we work through this transition – and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don’t convert to extra members or full paying accounts – near term engagement, as measured by third parties like Nielsen’s The Gauge, could be negatively impacted. However, we believe the pattern will be similar to what we’ve seen in Latin America, with engagement growing over time as we continue to deliver a great slate of programming and borrowers sign-up for their own accounts. Competition We continue to operate in a highly competitive market as consumers have a vast number of entertainment choices. Beyond our direct streaming competitors, we also vie for consumers’ time against linear TV, YouTube, short form entertainment like TikTok, and gaming, to name just a few. The silver lining is that the market for entertainment is huge and Netflix is still very small by comparison. For example, in the more than 190 countries we operate in, our $30B+ of annual revenue compares against the combined annual estimated ~$300B pay TV/streaming industry, $180B branded TV advertising spend and $130 billion consumer spend on gaming . 5 It’s not easy to build a large and profitable streaming business. But we’re competing from a position of strength, as we lead the industry in terms of engagement, revenue and streaming profit. As a pure-play streaming company, we’re also not anchored to shrinking legacy business models, like traditional entertainment firms, allowing us to lean hard into the big growth opportunity ahead of us. As we’ve said before, beyond revenue and profitability, another way to look at our business is through engagement, and we are pleased to have Kantar join Nielsen – who have expanded their efforts – and BARB to publicly report on both the shift from linear to streaming as well as the viewing share of different entertainment companies in Brazil, Mexico, and Poland. 5 Data based on Omdia, PWC, and SNL Kagan estimates and excludes China and Russia. Gaming figure excludes hardware sales. 6 As can be seen in the newly reported markets of Mexico, Brazil, and Poland, we are less than 5% of TV viewing. And in our largest markets like the US and the UK, we are still less than 10% of TV screen time. As one of the leaders in streaming across all markets, we’re encouraged by the fact that streaming overall accounts for less than 40% of viewing across these markets (and as little as 6% in Poland). We believe ultimately the vast majority of time spent on TV will happen via streaming, which should provide a long runway for growth as we continue to improve our service. tablet and laptop), all others are TV only. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities was $0.4B in Q4’22 (vs. -$0.4B in the prior year period) and $2.0B for FY22 (vs. $0.4B in FY21). Free cash flow (FCF) for Q4 totaled $0.3B, compared with -$0.6B in 6 the year ago quarter. For FY22, we generated FCF of $1.6B (vs. -$0.2B in FY21), above our forecast of approximately $1B. Now that we are a decade into our original programming initiative and have successfully scaled it, we are past the most cash intensive phase of this buildout. As a result, we believe we will now be generating sustained, positive annual free cash flow going forward. Assuming no material swings in F/X, we expect at least $3B of FCF for the full year 2023. We closed two previously announced acquisitions in Q4 - leading animation studio Animal Logic and games studio Spry Fox. We funded these purchases from cash on hand. 6 Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. 7 Gross debt at quarter end totaled $14B, in-line with our targeted range of $10-$15B. With cash and short term investments of $6B, net debt totaled $8B, or 1.3x LTM EBITDA. We don’t have any scheduled debt 7 maturities in FY23 and only $400M of debt maturities in FY24. All of our debt is fixed rate. Our capital structure policy is unchanged. The first priority for our cash is to reinvest in our core business and to fund new opportunities like gaming, followed by selective acquisitions. We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (e.g., about $5.2B based on Q4 revenue). After meeting those needs, we intend to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases. Assuming no material acquisitions, we anticipate resuming our share buyback program in 2023. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Two years ago we increased our focus on sustainability and related initiatives – building a team of 8 experts, announcing an ambitious environmental commitment, and exploring creative-friendly ways to reduce emissions in our productions (which account for more than half of our emissions as a company). As a result, Netflix production sets are becoming more sustainable through cleaner technologies, including electric vehicles and clean alternatives to diesel generators. In 2021, we created the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, committing $100M over five years to further develop our pipeline for underrepresented talent.  Through the fund, Netflix supports external organizations committed to creating equitable opportunities in the TV and film industries, as well as bespoke Netflix programs that help us to identify, train and provide job placement for emerging talent globally. To date we\\'ve committed $29M towards these initiatives, supporting over 1,000 up-and-coming creatives and more than 35 programs around the world.

Management believes that free cash flow, LTM EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Management believes that F/X neutral revenue and operating margin allows investors to compare our projected results to our actual results absent intra-year currency fluctuations. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. We are not able to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the exact amount or timing of the reconciling items, including property and equipment and change in other assets, and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our expected results for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023; adoption and growth of internet entertainment; growth outlook and market opportunity; competitive position; core strategy and business model; content offerings; our games strategy; monetization through pricing and tiering structures,  including paid sharing; ad-supported tier and its prospects; our competitors’ performance; account sharing; impact of foreign exchange rates; seasonality; cash spend; stock repurchases; paid net additions, membership growth and retention; engagement; consolidated revenue, revenue and ARM growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively, including for consumer engagement with different modes of entertainment; our ability to monetize account sharing; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; macroeconomic conditions and timing of content releases. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange 11 Commission (“SEC”) on January 27, 2022. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

       " 'FINAL-Q420-Shareholder-Letter': 'Fellow shareholders,  2020 was an incredibly difficult year with extraordinary loss for so many families, new restrictions that  none of us have ever had to live with before and great uncertainty. We’re enormously grateful that in  these uniquely challenging times we’ve been able to provide our members around the world with a  source of escape, connection and joy while continuing to build our business. With 8.5m paid net  additions in Q4, we crossed the 200m paid memberships mark. For the full year, we added a record 37m  paid memberships, achieved $25 billion in annual revenue (+24% year over year) and grew operating  profit 76% to $4.6 billion. Our summary results and forecast are below.    Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast  Average paid streaming memberships increased 23% year over year in Q4, while average revenue per  membership  was flat year over year both on a reported and foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis.  1 Revenue was 1% higher than our guidance forecast, as paid net adds exceeded our 6.0m projection by  2.5m. Operating margin of 14.4% (a 600bps increase from Q4’19) also came in above our guidance, due  to higher-than-expected revenue. EPS of $1.19 vs. $1.30 a year ago included a $258m non-cash  unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt.  For the full year, our 37m paid net additions represented a 31% increase from 2019’s 28m paid net adds.  We’re becoming an increasingly global service with 83% of our paid net adds in 2020 coming from  1 \\u200bAverage revenue per membership (ARM) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of  streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period; it was previously referred to as  streaming ARPU. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT.  1    outside the UCAN region. Our EMEA region accounted for 41% of our full year paid net adds, while APAC  was the second largest contributor to paid net additions with 9.3m (up 65% year over year).     As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report  and we strive for accuracy. For Q1’21, we expect paid net adds of 6.0m vs. last Q1’s 15.8m, which  included the impact from the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. Since the start of 2018, our paid memberships  have risen from 111m to 204m and our average revenue per membership has grown from $9.88 to  $11.02, despite significant F/X headwinds. This approach has allowed us to organically increase revenue  by $4-$5 billion annually over the past several years.   We’ve made good progress growing our profitability with FY20 operating margin of 18% rising five  percentage points over prior year. For FY21, we’re now targeting a 20% operating margin, up two  percentage points from 2020 and higher than our previous 19% forecast, due to a more favorable  revenue outlook. As we said last quarter, we intend to continue to grow our operating margin each year  at an average rate of three percentage points per year over any few-year period, but we anticipate some  lumpiness. Some years we’ll be a little over (like in 2020), some years a little under (like in 2021), but we  are trying to keep on an average three percentage points per year long-term trajectory.  Content  The big growth in streaming entertainment has led legacy competitors like Disney, WarnerMedia and  Discovery to compete with us in new ways, which we’ve been expecting for many years. This is, in part,  why we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a  wide range of genres and nations. Our fourth quarter slate highlights the breadth and diversity of our  entertainment offering.   2    In scripted English language television, season four of the critically acclaimed \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b was the biggest  season so far and drove new watchers of prior seasons. In its first 28 days, more member households  chose to watch season four of \\u200bThe Crown \\u200bthan each of the prior seasons, helping to grow the number of  member households that have chosen to watch this series to over 100m since its initial launch. In late  December, we released our first original series from Shonda Rhimes, \\u200bBridgerton.\\u200b This title has proven  immensely popular and we’ll have some exciting news about \\u200bBridgerton\\u200b later this week.   Our largest original film of the quarter was \\u200bThe Midnight Sky\\u200b, starring and directed by George Clooney;  we estimate 72m member households will choose to watch this title in its first four weeks. In its first 28  days, 43m member households chose to watch our animated feature film \\u200bOver the Moon\\u200b (directed by  legendary creator Glen Keane) with high levels of rewatching. \\u200bWe Can Be Heroes\\u200b (directed by Robert  Rodriguez) was another successful family film with a projected 53m member households choosing this  title in its first four weeks.   Our holiday movie slate also resonated with our members; in the first four weeks, 68m and 61m  member households chose to watch \\u200bHolidate\\u200b (starring Emma Roberts) and \\u200bThe Christmas Chronicles:  Part Two \\u200b(starring Kurt Russell), respectively. Our first Portuguese language holiday film from Brazil, \\u200bJust  Another Christmas\\u200b (starring Leandro Hassum)\\u200b,\\u200b was also a big hit with 26m member households globally  choosing to watch in the first 28 days of release.   We continue to ramp up our local original content slate. Our top local titles this quarter include  Barbarians \\u200b(a historical action series from Germany that 37m member households globally chose to  watch in the first four weeks), \\u200bSweet Home\\u200b, our Korean language horror show (22m member  households), \\u200bSelena: The Series\\u200b, which particularly resonated with members throughout Mexico and the  US (25m member households globally), and \\u200bAlice in Borderland\\u200b, a sci-fi thriller from Japan (18m member  households). While designed to be very impactful in the home country, we see many cases of our local  originals traveling more broadly. For example, \\u200bLupin\\u200b, an adrenalin-filled French language heist series  released in early January, has hit #2 in our US Top 10 list and ranked #1 in dozens of other countries  including Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Vietnam, the Philippines and many more. We  project 70m member households will choose to watch \\u200bLupin\\u200b in its first 28 days of release.  In addition to titles with big viewership, we also aspire to have hits that become part of the cultural  zeitgeist. In 2020 alone, we had \\u200bTiger King\\u200b, \\u200bBridgerton\\u200b and \\u200bThe Queen’s Gambit\\u200b. Not only did 62m  member households choose to watch \\u200bThe Queen’s Gambit\\u200b in its first 28 days (making this show our  biggest limited series in Netflix history), but it ignited\\u200b sales of chess sets\\u200b and inspired the next generation  of chess prodigies. In fact, Netflix series accounted for nine out of the 10 most searched shows globally  in 2020, while our films represented two of the top 10.               3    Google Year in Search, 2020 (Global)    Our productions are back up and running in most regions - we have learned that flexibility and  adaptability are paramount in this fast-changing environment. With over 500 titles currently in post  production or preparing to launch on our service and plans to release at least \\u200bone new original film  every week in 2021\\u200b with extraordinary talent, we’re confident we’ll continue to have a great content  offering for our members.  In Q1, in addition to the recently released season 3 of \\u200bCobra Kai \\u200band\\u200b Lupin\\u200b, we’re excited to be launching  later this quarter \\u200bTo All the Boys I’ve Loved Before 3\\u200b, the finale to this beloved rom com trilogy, our  young adult drama \\u200bFate: The Winx Saga\\u200b, \\u200bYes Day\\u200b (a family movie starring Jennifer Garner), \\u200bSky Rojo\\u200b, a  thrilling new series from the creators of \\u200bLa Casa de Papel\\u200b (aka \\u200bMoney Heist\\u200b) and \\u200bSpace Sweepers\\u200b, an  action packed Korean sci-fi film.   Product  Last year, we continued to improve our parental controls so that families have more control over their  experience. These enhancements include allowing members to filter out content at the title level or by  maturity rating, creating a profile lock PIN and customizing autoplay settings for any profile. We also  extended parental control support to downloads to give parents peace of mind regardless of how Netflix  is used. And we provided parents with more transparency into the themes, characters and content that  their kids love with the Kids Activity Report, a weekly message designed to keep parents informed about  the content their children are watching.  As we bring our members more great programming, we’re always listening and working to make it  easier for them to find the right show and film to watch. That’s why last year we debuted our Top 10  lists around the world, and in October we introduced the New & Popular tab in our television user  interface, which includes a new Worth the Wait section, highlighting titles as far as a year away that you  can remind yourself about. As another exciting step in this effort, we’ve been testing a new feature that  4    gives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse. The  response has been positive and we plan to roll it out globally in the first half of 2021.   Competition  It’s a great time to be a consumer of entertainment. There are a wealth of options ranging from linear  TV to video gaming to user generated content on YouTube and TikTok. We continue to work hard to  grow our small share of screen time against these major competitors.   Discovery\\u200b recently launched its streaming service. Disney+ is \\u200bexpanding\\u200b in new countries and with more  content. ViacomCBS will be unveiling its plans for Paramount+ in 2021. Combined with the launch of  AppleTV+, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming services, this signifies that  these companies all recognize the future is streaming entertainment, a vision we have been working  towards since inception.   Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members,  we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment. This past year is a testament to this approach.  Disney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid  membership growth in our history.   Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Net cash generated by operating activities in Q4 was -$138 million vs. -$1.5 billion in the prior year  period. Free cash flow  (FCF) for the quarter was -$284 million vs. -$1.7 billion in Q4‘19, bringing full year  2 2020 free cash flow to +$1.9 billion vs. -$3.3 billion in 2019.  We believe we are very close to being sustainably FCF positive. For the full year 2021, we currently  anticipate free cash flow will be around break even (vs. our prior expectation for -$1 billion to break  even). Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750m undrawn credit facility, \\u200bwe believe  we\\u200b \\u200bno longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations.\\u200b Our 5.375%  February 1, 2021 bonds mature in Q1. We plan on repaying the bond at maturity out of cash on hand, as  we are currently well above our minimum cash needs.   As we generate excess cash, we intend to maintain $10B-15B in gross debt and will explore returning  cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks, as we did in the past (2007-2011).   Long-Term Stock Price Performance  We thank our equity and debt investors for their trust and for coming along with us on our journey to  build one of the world’s leading entertainment companies. Since day one, we’ve managed Netflix for the  long term under the belief that pleasing our members would lead to strong value creation for our fellow  shareholders.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations,  including investments in global streaming content. However, this non-GAAP measure should be  considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted  earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.  Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding investment in our service; average revenue per  membership; future content offerings and the number and timing of such offerings; viewing metrics for  certain titles; product enhancements and offerings; future capital and external financing needs; debt  repayment; global streaming paid members, paid net additions and membership growth; consolidated  revenue, revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share; and  free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions;  production risks, including those related to the coronavirus pandemic; and, competition, including  consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.

       " 'FINAL_Q2_15_Letter_to_Shareholders_With_Tables_': \"Fellow shareholders,    In Q2, we eclipsed 65 million members, with over 42 million in the US and 23 million internationally.  We  are at the forefront of a wave of global Internet TV adoption and intend to make our service available  throughout the world by the end of 2016.  Our summary results and Q3 forecast are below.                 1  Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast  We added a Q2 record 3.3 million new streaming members, compared to 1.7 million in the previous year  quarter.  As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we  report and we clearly under-forecast in Q2 (forecast was 2.5 million net adds).   We strive for accuracy in  the forecast and our Q3 estimates are based on everything we know up to today.     We gained 0.9 million members in the US and added  2.4 million members internationally in Q2. We  believe the higher than anticipated level of acquisition was fueled by the growing strength of our  original programming slate, which in Q2 included the first seasons of \\u200bMarvel’s Daredevil\\u200b, \\u200bSense8,  Dragons: Race to the Edge \\u200band \\u200bGrace and Frankie\\u200b as well as season 3 of \\u200bOrange is the New Black\\u200b.  US  revenue growth was also driven by a 5% year over year increase in ASP due to uptake in our HD  2-stream plan. We continue to target a 40% US contribution margin by 2020, even though we are  running ahead of plan given stronger than expected top line performance and lower content and other  streaming costs. We are forecasting Q3 US net adds of 1.15 million, slightly higher than the year ago  period.     Our international segment is growing at a rapid pace. We did not add additional markets in Q2 but saw  continued improvement across existing markets, including a full quarter of additions from our successful  March 24, 2015 launch in Australia/New Zealand.  We project Q3 international net adds of 2.4 million.     International revenue grew 48% year over year, despite an -$83 million impact from currency (+5% ASP  growth x-F/X). As we expected, international losses increased sequentially with a full quarter of  operating costs in AU/NZ. We expect this trend to continue in the second half as we launch additional  markets (Japan in Q3 and Spain, Italy and Portugal in Q4) and prepare for further global expansion in  2016, including China as we continue to explore options there.     EPS for Q2 amounted to $0.06 after adjustment for our 7-for-1 stock split (EPS would have been $0.42  using pre-split share count). We remain committed to running around break-even globally on a net  income basis through 2016, and to then deliver material global profits in 2017 and beyond.     Content  We are making great progress shifting to exclusive content and expanding our original content, which  differentiates our service, drives enjoyment for existing members and helps motivate consumers to join  Netflix.     In Q2, we launched our largest number to date of high profile Netflix original series.  On April 10,  Marvel’s Daredevil \\u200bdebuted to strong audience engagement, particularly for a new show. \\u200bGrace and  Frankie,\\u200b the bittersweet comedy starring Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda which launched on May 8,  also has  found a broad and appreciative audience around the world. Both series have already begun their second  season of production.     2  Our global expansion extends to our content strategy as well. \\u200bSense8, \\u200bthe mind-bending cinematic  thriller from the Wachowski siblings and J. Michael Straczynski that debuted June 5, is an ambitious,  truly international show with talent behind and in front of the camera from multiple countries.  Similarly, on August 7, we will launch in all territories our first non-English language original, \\u200bClub de  Cuervos\\u200b, \\u200ba family comedy set in the world of \\u200bfutbol\\u200b from Mexican filmmaker Gaz Alazraki, and on August  28, \\u200b \\u200bNarcos\\u200b, \\u200ba gripping account of the roots of the cocaine trade, shot in Colombia and starring the great  Brazilian star Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar.     The original documentary \\u200bChef’s Table\\u200b and our latest DreamWorks Animation series \\u200bDragons: Race to  the Edge\\u200b are among our most viewed new originals to date. They are the perfect example of what we  strive for in our original programming; an elevated version of popular genres that reach a large audience  globally.     We closed the quarter with season 3 of \\u200bOrange is the New Black,\\u200b which went live on June 11 and set off  a social media shockwave around the world. On the following Sunday, Netflix members globally watched  a record number of hours in a single day, led by \\u200bOrange,\\u200b despite the season finale of HBO’s \\u200bGame of  Thrones\\u200b and game five of the NBA finals also falling on that Sunday. Global enthusiasm for the third  season of \\u200bOrange\\u200b underlines our ability to create franchise properties that bring new members to Netflix  as well as delighting current ones.  Nearly ninety percent of Netflix members have engaged with  Netflix  original content, another indicator that we are on the right path.     We anticipate that as our global content spend approaches $5 billion in 2016 on a P&L basis (over $6  billion cash), we will devote more investment to originals both in absolute dollars and percentage terms.  This includes not only series, documentaries and stand-up but also original feature films.    We are moving into the original film business in order to have new, high-quality movies that our global  members can find only on Netflix. As with series, we’ve chosen to take a portfolio approach covering a  wide variety of genres and based around creators with great track records and stories they are  passionate about. The first of our films, \\u200bBeasts of No Nation, \\u200ba gripping war drama from the  award-winning director Cary Fukunaga (\\u200bTrue Detective) \\u200band starring award-winning Idris Elba \\u200b(Mandela,  Luther, The Wire)\\u200b will be available to all Netflix members and in select theaters in October.  In June, we  announced \\u200bWar Machine\\u200b, a provocative satirical comedy starring Brad Pitt, which will be exclusively  available to Netflix members and in select theaters next year. The release schedule for our slate of  original films can be found \\u200bhere\\u200b.    Product  In June, we unveiled the new Netflix website, our first major update in over four years. \\u200bThe new  experience has been built from the ground up to make it faster and easier for our members to discover  great content to watch. The UI is a richer and more visual experience with improved title art and a  better details view. It also works more like an app and less like a series of linked web pages. Early  feedback has been positive from both members and the media, and retention should benefit.    3  In support of expanding our service globally, we are focused on adding more languages, optimizing our  personalization algorithms for a global library in local markets, and expanding support for a range of  device, operator and payment partnerships.  We are also placing a greater emphasis on optimizing for  mobile, which is the main means for Internet access in many emerging markets where we will be  expanding in the future.     Strong Net Neutrality  Charter Communications made net neutrality history today by committing to open and free  interconnection across the Charter/TWC network, if their pending merger is approved. This move  ensures that all online video providers can aggressively compete for consumers' favor, without selective  and increasing fees paid to ISPs. Charter's interconnection policy is the right way to scale the Internet.  It  means consumer will receive the fast connection speeds they expect.   The Charter/TWC transaction,  with this condition, would deliver significant public interest benefits to broadband consumers, and we  urge its timely approval.     Competition  We compete with linear TV, PPV, video piracy, other Internet networks, video gaming and many other  sources of entertainment. The recent Sandvine results from North America show that, looking at just the  Internet networks segment, we continue to improve faster than others.  Note that this data measures  peak megabits, not peak viewing hours, so YouTube, for example, with more modest average video  quality, is underrepresented in terms of hours.               4  DVD  Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve 5.3 million members and provided $77.9 million  in contribution profit in Q2.  The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and TV shows,  remains appealing to a core user base and means that the tail on this business should be quite long.    Free Cash Flow & Capital  Free cash flow in Q2 amounted to -$229 million, compared with -$163 million in Q1. As we have  previously detailed, our investment in originals is working capital intensive, which results in higher cash  spent upfront relative to content amortization, and, we anticipate this trend to continue given our  increased investment in originals.  At the end of Q2, gross debt totaled $2.4 billion, which represented  4.6x LTM EBITDA and we ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash & equivalents and short term  investments.     Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bApril 2015\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2015\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2014\\u200b,  July 2014\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2014\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2014\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2013\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2013\\u200b.     Summary  We’re pleased to see the growing momentum of our original programming driving strong growth in the  US and abroad.  With our first set of international markets having achieved contribution profitability,  we’ll be making our first foray into Asia this Fall with our Japan launch, and are gearing up to offer our  service around the globe.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 540-3700      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures  This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the r\\u200belease of tax reserves\\u200b, free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as these measures exclude effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However,  these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding US contribution margin growth; international expansion;  content launches; product improvements; content spend, including investments in originals; lifespan of  our DVD business; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid;  revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and  free cash flow.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions;  production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of  different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such  6  forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January  29, 2015.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual  performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above  and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking  statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.    7                                                                                                                                                          8 Netflix, Inc.

       " 'FINAL_Q3_15_Letter_to_Shareholders_With_Tables_': \"Fellow shareholders,    We have grown to over 69 million members around the world and expect to end this year with over 74  million members.  With a successful launch in Japan, and our launches next week in Spain, Italy and  Portugal, we remain on track to become global by the end of 2016.  Our summary results and forecast  for Q4 are below.                1  Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Global membership grew 3.62 million to 69.17 million members compared to prior year growth of 3.02  million, and a forecast of 3.55 million.  Operating income was $74 million, compared to prior year of  $110 million and a forecast of $81 million.  Seven quarters ago we moved to providing you our internal  forecast for the quarter ahead.  We strive for accuracy in this projection and, when it comes to global  net additions, Q3 was our most accurate to date: we were within 2% (3.62 vs. 3.55) and within 10% on  operating income ($74m vs. $81m).    While global growth was as we expected, our forecast was high for the US and low for international.  We  added 0.88 million new US members in the quarter compared to 0.98 million prior year and a forecast of  1.15 million.  Our over-forecast in the US for Q3 was due to slightly higher-than-expected involuntary  churn (inability to collect), which we believe was driven in part by the ongoing transition to chip-based  credit and debit cards.  In terms of US net additions, through the first nine months of 2015, we are  slightly ahead of prior year, and we expect to finish 2015 at about 2014 levels.  This would mark the 4th  consecutive year we’ve added about 6 million members in the US.     Our US contribution margin in Q3 expanded 375 basis points year over year to 32.4%. This was inclusive  of an acceleration in the amortization of some of our licensed content, similar to how we already treat  originals and reflecting more viewing in the first month.  The effect of this change was a $13 million  decrease in US streaming contribution profit in Q3.  For Q4, we anticipate 1.65 million US net adds and  US contribution margin of 34.0%  vs. 28.0% in the year ago quarter. We continue to target a 40% US  contribution margin by 2020.    International net add growth totaled 2.74 million compared to 2.04 million in the prior year and a 2.40  million forecast.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency ($96 million on a year over year basis),  international ASP improved 6% vs. Q3 ‘14, helped by plan mix.  In August, we raised our high-definition  2-screen monthly price plan in Europe by one Euro without negatively impacting growth.     As we have indicated previously, international contribution losses will grow sequentially in Q4 as we  launch Spain, Italy and Portugal.  We have announced our expansion to South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan  and Singapore in early 2016.  Our plan remains to run around break-even through 2016 and to deliver  material profits thereafter.     Last week we increased prices in several countries including the US, to improve our ability to acquire and  offer high quality content, which is the number one member request. Our US pricing is now $7.99 for  our standard-definition 1-screen-at-a-time plan (unchanged), $9.99 for our high-definition 2-screen plan  (up $1), and $11.99 for ultra-high-definition 4-screen plan (unchanged).  Members who were paying  $8.99 for the high-definition plan are grandfathered at that price for one year.         2  Content  As our membership expands, we are quickly becoming a global distribution platform for creators  worldwide. \\u200bNarcos\\u200b, our latest original series, is a hit and is another fine example of a Netflix original -  embraced by both \\u200bcritics\\u200b and \\u200baudiences\\u200b and global in nature (bilingual, Brazilian director and star, US  and Latin American cast, shot in Colombia) with substantial viewing across all our territories.     This past quarter, we also unveiled our first locally-produced original series, \\u200bClub de Cuervos\\u200b, which  played strongly not just in its home country of Mexico but with Spanish speakers around the world,  including the US. We are currently in production on our second Mexican original series, \\u200bIngobernable\\u200b,  starring Latin American TV superstar, Kate del Castillo, and the French produced \\u200bMarseille\\u200b.  We have  also announced original series productions in Brazil and \\u200bItaly\\u200b.    We will launch our first original feature film \\u200bBeasts of No Nation \\u200bon Netflix on October 16. This gripping  war drama featuring Idris Elba and Abraham Attah has received \\u200buniversal critical acclaim\\u200b and is an early  Oscar \\u200bhopeful.  Attah won the prestigious \\u200bMarcello Mastroianni Award \\u200bat the Venice Film Festival  recognizing him as the best newcomer.  We’re also excited to release the first of four films from Adam  Sandler, \\u200bThe\\u200b \\u200bRidiculous Six\\u200b, in December. This release comes on the heels of Sandler’s global success  with \\u200bPixels\\u200b ($240M worldwide box office) and the currently hot \\u200bHotel Transylvania 2 \\u200b(already grossing  over $200M worldwide box office and yet to be released in many of the larger foreign markets)\\u200b.    Just three years into our originals strategy, we have come a long way and our content is increasingly  recognized for its quality and breadth. This year, we garnered a Netflix-record 34 Emmy nominations,  across 11 of our original series and documentaries and won four. Netflix and HBO were the only  networks to have 3 shows competing for best series honors this year. HBO had an amazing year at the  Emmys, but we have only just begun. In addition, Common Sense Media recently named 6 of our  original series among the \\u200b25 best shows\\u200b on TV for families with kids from age 2-17.     It is clear that Internet TV is becoming increasingly mainstream and traditional media companies are  adjusting to the shift from linear to on-demand viewing. It is a great time to be a creator of content  because studios make content to sell content (not to withhold it) and there are new bidders for their  product. Some studios will choose to license content to SVOD services like Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant  Video and Netflix. Others may not.  We have a lot of content to select from.     We recently announced that we have acquired global second window rights to four major series. These  are \\u200bHow to Get Away with Murder\\u200b, ABC’s highest rated new series from the 2014/2015 TV season, the  eagerly anticipated \\u200bColony\\u200b from Legendary Television and Universal Cable Productions and, from CBS,  Zoo\\u200b, the most-watched scripted summer series of 2015 and the critically acclaimed, Emmy nominated  and Golden Globe winning \\u200bJane the Virgin\\u200b. These deals will ensure that audiences around the world will  have access to these exciting series on Netflix.      3  Last month, we did not renew our deal to carry movies from EPIX, as the films were non-exclusive,  US-only and offered in windows even further behind other premium Pay TV outlets. So far, we’ve seen  no material reduction in US feature film viewing as we have so many other films for members to enjoy.  We are investing in high profile, exclusive and globally available original films and creating the  first-of-their-kind global Pay TV deals directly with producers. In some cases, we are making the films  available globally after a 30 day theatrical and VOD window or in the case of the upcoming New Regency  film \\u200bThe Big Short, \\u200bwith Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell, we will offer the film  globally in a more traditional Pay TV window several months after theatrical and transactional VOD, in  all territories excluding France.     Product  In September, we expanded our in-app purchase relationship with Apple by extending our partnership  from Apple TV to iPhone and iPad. Now, new members around the world can sign up for Netflix in-app  on the iPhone and iPad, creating a more seamless user experience.     We recently announced a partnership with Virgin America, where new and existing members are able to  stream the full Netflix service to their personal devices (at no additional cost) at 35,000 feet in the sky  on newly upgraded Virgin America aircraft. Partnerships like this advance our goal to bring Netflix  streaming to members wherever they are and whenever they want.    Competition  The competitive landscape remains vibrant as Netflix competes with many forms of entertainment for  consumers’ leisure time. Other SVOD services continue to evolve: Hulu now offers a commercial free  option at $11.99 per month, HBO GO is expanding into Latin America,  and the press reported that  Amazon Prime spent about $250 million on the new Jeremy Clarkson show. They remain active bidders  for content, in addition to all the cable networks around the world.     As we have written in our \\u200bLong-Term View\\u200b, linear networks that embrace on demand and Internet  delivery as we have, will become more valuable and will experience renewed growth (like HBO Now),  while those that do not will lose relevancy.  The secular shift to on-demand consumption is best  described as “consumers evolving vs. old habits” rather than “Netflix vs. traditional media.” We’re all  racing to fulfill consumer desires.    DVD  Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve and please over 5 million members, providing us  with $80 million in contribution profit in Q3 (down 11% Y/Y).  The broad selection of titles, including new  release movies and TV shows, remains attractive to a core member base and means that the tail on this  business should be quite long.        4  Free Cash Flow and Capital  Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$252 million, down from -$229 million in Q2, due to the working capital  intensity of our investment in originals, which results in higher cash spent upfront relative to content  amortization. Investing in originals remains the right strategy for Netflix.  Exclusive first-window “only on  Netflix” content differentiates our service, allows us to leverage our global platform, reduces our  dependence on third parties, and adds positive brand halo.  Moreover, as more of our content spend is  devoted to producing and owning our originals, we are building long term library value.     At the end of Q3, gross debt totaled $2.4 billion, which represents a debt to total cap ratio of about 5%,  and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash & equivalents and short term investments.  We are  likely to raise additional capital next year to fund our continued content investments.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However,  these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion, content launches, including  timing of feature film availability; business outlook for our DVD segment; raising capital; member growth  domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  6  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2015.  The Company  provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from  these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or  circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.  7                                                                                                                                                          8 Netflix, Inc.

       " 'FINAL_Q3_Letter': \"Fellow shareholders,    In Q3, quarterly global streaming revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time (up 36% year over year),  helped by our strong content slate including \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b and the second season of \\u200bNarcos\\u200b.

In Q3, we added 0.4 million members in the US vs. our forecast of 0.3 million and 3.2 million members  internationally vs. our forecast of 2.0 million.  Our over-performance against forecast (86.7m total  streaming members vs. forecast of 85.5m) was driven primarily by stronger than expected acquisition  due to excitement around Netflix original content.   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report  and we strive for accuracy. In Q3, we under forecasted member growth, while in Q2, it was the opposite.  For the first nine months of 2016, we’ve added 12 million global members, the same as in the first nine  months of 2015.  By the end of Q3’16, we had un-grandfathered 75% of the members that are being un-grandfathered  this year and the impact has been consistent with our expectations. ASP grew over 10% year-over-year  in both the US and international segments (excluding a $35 million F/X impact). With more revenue, we  can reinvest to further improve Netflix to attract new members from around the world, while continuing  to delight our existing customers.   Domestically, revenue rose 23% year over year, 480 basis points faster than Q2. US marketing expense  rose as a percentage of revenue as we spent to build awareness for our expanding number of original  titles. US contribution profit increased 38% year-over-year with contribution margin expanding to 36%,  slightly ahead of our 35% forecast.  In the international segment, we exceeded our internal projection for net adds as the acquisition impact  of our originals was greater than anticipated across many of our markets. F/X-neutral revenue rose 72%  and international contribution loss was flat sequentially at $69 million as content costs came in under  our forecast due partly to timing. We are investing in more content across multiple international  markets in Q4 and, as a result, we project international contribution loss to grow moderately to $75  million.   In September, we localized Netflix in Poland and Turkey. We began accepting payment in local currency  and added a local language user interface, subtitles and dubbing as well as some local content. We have  seen nice gains in viewing and retention and we’ll undertake other localization efforts in the coming  months and years.   For Q4, we forecast 5.2 million global net adds, with 1.45 million net adds in the US and 3.75 million new  members internationally. Our expectation for a moderate year-over-year decline in net adds reflects the  completion of un-grandfathering. We are pleased with the results thus far as we expect ASP to grow  12% from Q1’16 to Q4’16. Internationally, the initial demand from our launch in Spain, Portugal and Italy  in Q4’15 will also affect our year-over-year net adds comparison.   2  We will face a tough international net adds comparison in Q1’17 because of the initial membership  surge in Q1’16 tied to the launch of 130 additional territories.  As discussed, for the balance of 2016, we will continue to operate around break even, and then start  generating material global profits in 2017 and beyond, by marching up operating margins steadily for  many years.  Content  We kicked off Q3 with the release of \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b on July 15 to both critical and audience \\u200bacclaim\\u200b.  This nostalgic, supernatural thriller proved to be the \\u200bblockbuster of the summer\\u200b and is the kind of broad  appeal, cross demographic, and cross border sensation that we hope will distinguish Netflix original  content. \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b is also notable as it is produced and owned by Netflix, which provides us with  more attractive economics and greater business and creative control. In August, we launched \\u200bThe Get  Down\\u200b, a highly stylized drama set in 1970s New York City, detailing the origins of hip-hop. We look  forward to releasing part two of season one next year.   Our hit series \\u200bNarcos\\u200b returned for season two in September to great success among critics and  audiences \\u200balike\\u200b. \\u200bNarcos \\u200bhad a positive impact on member acquisition across all of our markets,  demonstrating the ability for our tentpole franchises to connect with audiences across the world. We  closed the quarter with \\u200bMarvel’s Luke Cage\\u200b, the latest installment in our Marvel series, which will  continue with \\u200bIron Fist\\u200b on March 17, 2017. We are also looking forward next year to \\u200bThe Defenders\\u200b, a  team-up of the characters from our first four Marvel series.   We are now in the fourth year of our original content strategy and are pleased with our progress. In  2017, we intend to release over 1,000 hours of premium original programming, up from over 600 hours  this year. The Internet allows us to reach audiences all over the world and, with a growing base of over  86 million members, there’s a large appetite for entertainment and a diversity of tastes to satisfy.   We are fortunate that our Internet-centric, on-demand, subscription-only business model allows us to  support programs for both mass and niche audiences alike. Our personalization algorithms help us  promote the right content to the right viewers. And since we are not shelf-space constrained nor reliant  on advertising, we have the luxury to tell all kinds of stories in less traditional ways. The growth of  Internet TV globally has ushered in a new golden age of content, with consumers everywhere enjoying  unprecedented access to amazing amounts of high quality programming.   With an expanding content budget (approximately $6 billion in 2017 on a P&L basis), we judge the  success of our portfolio of originals in several ways. For each series or film, we measure the impact on  acquisition and member engagement which, in turn, is correlated with retention. To determine relative  performance, we look at each title’s share of viewing compared with its share of our content budget. We  also take into account qualitative factors such as earned media coverage and awards, which enhance  our brand and our ability to attract talent for future projects. This year, we are thrilled to have won nine  Emmys (out of 54 nominations) across six different shows.   3  This past quarter, we announced a global pact with 20th Century Fox Studios to license \\u200bThe People vs.  O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story \\u200band \\u200bQueen of the South\\u200b and an agreement with The Walt Disney Co.  to license \\u200bQuantico\\u200b and \\u200bAmerican Crime\\u200b in the US and Canada. We are also increasingly ensuring early  financing and sharing windows globally with original broadcasters for series like \\u200bStar Trek: Discovery  from CBS, \\u200bThe Alienist \\u200bfrom Paramount TV and the just-launched  ABC series \\u200bDesignated Survivor\\u200b from  eOne.  Product and Partnerships  We continue to make progress with our MVPD partnerships. We are excited that the Netflix app will be  available across \\u200bLiberty Global’s footprint\\u200b beginning in the Netherlands later this year and expanding to  other countries in 2017. Partnerships like this and our integration on X1 with \\u200bComcast\\u200b validate the  strength of our content and that we are additive to the current offerings of MVPDs. By working  together, MVPDs can sell richer Internet and TV packages, while consumers can more easily sign up for  and access Netflix, thus allowing Netflix and our partners to better serve our shared customers.  China  The regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging. We  now plan to license content to existing online service providers in China rather than operate our own  service in China in the near term. We expect revenue from this licensing will be modest. We still have a  long term desire to serve the Chinese people directly, and hope to launch our service in China  eventually.   Competition  We face immense competition for consumer screen time. Despite video gaming getting better, video  messaging and sharing improving, MVPD UI enhancements, YouTube growth, more SVOD services, and  other screen time competitors, Netflix continues to win both time and affection. We presume that  Amazon Prime Video will become as global as YouTube and Netflix this fall with the launch of the Jeremy  Clarkson show.  Our challenge is to continue to improve our service and content so that we better meet  consumer desires. Total screen time is quite large and growing as technology and content improve  globally.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q3, free cash flow was -$506 million vs. -$254 million in Q2’16 and -$252 million in the year ago  quarter. The increase in our free cash flow deficit reflects the growth of original content, which we are  increasingly producing and owning (rather than licensing). Self-produced shows like \\u200bStranger Things  require more cash upfront as we incur spending during the creation of each show prior to its completion  and release. In comparison, we generally pay on delivery for licensed originals like \\u200bOrange is the New  Black\\u200b and we pay over the term of the agreement for licensed non-originals (eg, \\u200bScandal\\u200b).    4  Over the long run, we believe self-producing is less expensive (including cost of capital) than licensing a  series or film, as we work directly with the creative community and eliminate additional overhead and  fees. In addition, we own the underlying intellectual property, providing us with global rights and more  business and creative control. Combined with the success of our portfolio of originals and the positive  impact on our member and revenue growth, we believe this is a wise investment that creates long term  value. Consequently, we plan on investing more, which will continue to weigh on free cash flow. We  expect Q4’16 FCF to be similar to Q3’16 FCF. Over time, we will be able to fund more of our investment  in programming through the growth in operating profit and margin already underway.  Streaming content obligations at quarter end were $14.4 billion, up $1 billion sequentially. The increase  reflects the addition of both new original and non-original content to our library as well as expanded  rights for our new territories.   We finished the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents. As we have often done over the past  few years, we plan to raise additional debt in the coming weeks. With a debt to total capitalization ratio  of about 5%, we remain underleveraged compared both to similar firms and to our view of an efficient  capital structure. Our 2025 bonds continue to \\u200btrade well\\u200b.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bJuly 2016\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2016\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary, 2016\\u200b,  October 2015\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2015\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2015\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2015\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2014\\u200b.      Conclusion   We have many fantastic titles to enjoy. For investors, though, we’d like to call out the \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b.  If you  appreciated \\u200bMad Men\\u200b, \\u200bHouse of Cards\\u200b and \\u200bDownton Abbey, \\u200bwe think you will find \\u200bThe Crown  extraordinary. It debuts November 4, three Fridays from now.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 809-5360      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     5  Use of Non-GAAP Measures\\xa0 This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-\\u200bGAAP financial measures of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves, revenue and ASP growth on a  constant currency basis, free cash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that the non\\u200b-GAAP measure  of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves provides useful information as  this measure excludes effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes  that the non-GAAP financial measures of revenue and ASP growth on a constant currency basis are  useful in assessing underlying business performance excluding the effect of foreign currency rate  fluctuations.  Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics  because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay  debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-\\u200bGAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, revenue,  operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other  financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these  non\\u200b-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.  Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding content investments; localization efforts; ASP;  profitability in 2017 and beyond; content releases and programming hours; our content budget; MVPD  partnerships; business plans for China; future capital raises and timing of such raises; domestic and  international net additions, and total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income and margin, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The  forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain  existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for  streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions  of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of  viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company  provides internal forecast numbers.

       " 'Investor-Letter-Q1-2012': \"1  April 23rd, 2012     Dear Fellow Shareholders,  Netflix added nearly 3 million streaming members in Q1, bringing our total to over 26 million global  streaming members, and strengthening our position as the world’s leading Internet TV network.   We  anticipate returning to global profitability in Q2, and plan to launch our next international market in Q4.    We are constantly improving our service with better personalization, better user-interfaces, better  streaming, and more content.  As a result, per-member viewing hours set new records in Q1 and are on  track to do so again in Q2, on a year-over-year basis.  We launched our service in the UK and Ireland in  January and are very pleased that, after the first 90 days, we had substantially more members than we  had after the first 90 days of Canada or Latin America.

New content additions, steady improvement to the Netflix user-interfaces and personalization  algorithms, and the receding impact of last year’s brand hit, all continue to contribute to incremental  improvements in our domestic streaming business and the resulting member growth.    The domestic streaming segment delivered $67 million of contribution profit, equivalent to a 13%  contribution margin. We exceeded our domestic streaming contribution margin target of around 11%,  due to slightly lower than expected content, delivery, and customer service expenses.  Outlook – Increased Seasonality in Net Adds  We anticipate that U.S. streaming contribution margin will expand in Q2 to about 15%.   For Q3 onward,  we are targeting 100 bps of average margin expansion per quarter, consistent with our January  guidance.   We think our 2012 domestic streaming net adds will be about the same as in 2010 (about 7 million), and  that gross adds will approximately follow the 2010 seasonal pattern.    At the same time, we have more net add quarterly seasonality this year due to our larger starting  membership base for the same amount of annual net adds.  In other words, given the same gross add  quarterly distribution as in 2010, and the same annual net adds, it is inherent that the quarterly  variation in net adds is amplified.  We have included an appendix at the end of this letter to illustrate  this.    Due to this increased net add quarterly seasonality, Q2 net adds will be below those of 2010, despite Q2  gross adds following the traditional seasonal pattern, and despite us expecting to match 2010 in annual  net additions.    We see nothing new or particularly concerning this quarter to date in our member viewing, acquisition  and retention.  All are healthy.     Domestic Content Library  As a result of the significant investments in our streaming library over the last 18 months, we have  meaningfully increased the quantity and quality of the TV shows and movies on the service. Going  forward, we continue to sign new agreements to bolster our content offering, while also benefiting from  our established relationships with all major producers of film and TV in the U.S. that continue to ensure  a steady flow of new titles to the service. As we stated in our January letter, we are growing content      3  spend sequentially every quarter, but slower than domestic streaming revenue growth to allow for  margin expansion.   Feature Films  In Q1, we added several notable new release Pay TV 1 feature film titles to the service, including  Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature, “Rango”, “The Lincoln Lawyer”, and “Justin Bieber:  Never Say Never”.  Meanwhile, our studio partners continue to provide additional high quality catalog  product.    We recently announced a new multi-year licensing agreement with The Weinstein Company that will  make foreign language, documentary and certain other movies exclusively available for Netflix members  in the U.S.  As a result, this year’s Academy Award winner for Best Picture “The Artist” and Best  Documentary “Undefeated” will be shown in their Pay TV 1 window exclusively on Netflix.   Looking forward to Q2, the volume of exclusive titles we receive through agreements with several mini- major distributors will steadily increase.  Notably, the action-thriller “Killer Elite” distributed by Open  Road Films will come to Netflix along with several films from Film District including Golden Globe  nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, “In the Land of Blood and Honey”, critically acclaimed action- drama, “Drive”, and “The Rum Diary” starring Johnny Depp.  Meanwhile, titles arriving from Epix are  getting even better with “Thor” and “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”, also coming this quarter.  The Starz deal for 15 Disney Pay TV 1 output titles, plus some catalog films, ended in February.  There  was no discernible change in churn or viewing levels.   Instead, the trend towards watching episodic TV,  like “Breaking Bad”, on Netflix continues to grow.  On a year-over-year basis, our content is stronger  than it has ever been, and our viewing per member is at a record high level.     TV Content  Our selection of TV content also got stronger in Q1, as we added  shows like “Supernatural” and “90210”  from the CW, “Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior” and the Showtime series “United States of Tara” from  CBS, AMC’s “The Killing” and A&E’s “Breakout Kings” from Fox, “Being Human (U.S.)” from Muse  Entertainment, and Comedy Central’s “Workaholics” from Viacom Media Networks. Meanwhile, we  continue to add new seasons of existing series every quarter. In addition, we recently announced our  first deal with Hasbro, providing Netflix with a wide variety of new kids content including “My Little  Pony” and “Transformers: Prime”.      In the past, we have said that our licensing of complete back seasons of on-air TV series is not only a  great experience for Netflix members, but can help build the audience for new seasons. We saw this  demonstrated recently with the premiere of Season 5 of “Mad Men” on AMC achieving its biggest  audience yet (20% higher than last season’s premiere), subsequent to the first four seasons becoming  available on Netflix last summer.  Even now, the most watched episode of “Mad Men” on any given day  on Netflix is the first episode of the first season. This means we are still growing the fan base for this  show nearly 6 years after it first premiered on television.      4  Domestic Streaming Competition  We compete for consumers’ viewing time with a very wide range of video sources, including linear TV  (MVPD and free-to-air), DVR, over-the-top (OTT) pure plays such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant  Video, and authenticated streaming offerings of the MVPDs and cable networks (TV Everywhere).   Hulu launched its first original series, and has continued its platform (Wii) and country (Japan)  expansion.   While we have ten times more domestic paid members, and we added over three times  more domestic net additions than Hulu in Q1, we do watch them carefully.   Most of their viewing, we  believe, is from current-season broadcast-network content.    Amazon continues to grow its U.S. video content library available through Amazon Prime.  We think they  are still substantially behind Hulu in viewing hours.  Given Amazon’s size and ambitions, we continue to  track their progress carefully as well.    As we’ve often said, we see the biggest long-term competition for viewing hours from MVPDs and cable  networks through their TV Everywhere offerings. Consistent with this view, we began to see the  consumer promise of TV Everywhere emerge in Q1, with all major networks and many MVPDs investing  in their Internet applications and taking steps to evolve to Internet TV networks. Among recent  developments, both HBO GO as well as Comcast’s Xfinity application became available on the Xbox.   Additionally, Comcast announced its Streampix streaming service available to current Comcast  subscribers. Given the superiority of our content selection, user interfaces and device ubiquity, we don’t  currently see any meaningful near-term impact on our business from these developments.   Internet Caps Should Apply Equally, or Not At All.   Comcast caps its residential broadband customers at 250 gigabytes per month.   On the Xbox, the Netflix  app, the Hulu app, and the HBO GO app, are all subject to this cap.  But Comcast has decided that its  own Xfinity Xbox app is not subject to this 250 gigabyte cap.   This is not neutral in any sense.   The Xbox  is a pure Internet device with a single IP address, works over a consumer’s home wifi, and data to the  Xbox is Internet data.  When the Xfinity Xbox app uses lots of bandwidth, it competes for that  bandwidth with all other Internet usage and users in the home.  The Xfinity Xbox app “speaks” TCP/IP  like any other Internet device. The only difference between the Xfinity Xbox data and Netflix Xbox data  is the Xfinity data is favored by Comcast exempting it from the cap.    Comcast could raise the cap and make it apply equally or just eliminate the caps.   Net neutrality  principles mean a level playing field for all Internet applications.    International Streaming  We surpassed 3 million total international streaming members this quarter, growing 65% sequentially,  and adding 1.2 million total net additions (and nearly 1 million paid net additions).  Just six quarters after  our first international market launch, our non-U.S. members account for nearly 12% of total (and 10% of  paid) Netflix streaming members.      5  UK and Ireland  The largest driver of growth in international members in Q1 was the launch of our service in the UK and  Ireland at the beginning of January. From the start, we achieved the highest net additions we’ve ever  seen in the first 90 days of an international market launch.   While the UK is a very competitive market, we have found that the existence of competition can be  beneficial for driving interest and demand in our service.  The existence of other over-the-top (OTT)  streaming and on-demand services creates a high level of product understanding and acceptance among  consumers and that, in turn, increases their willingness to try Netflix.  In January, we launched with an impressive and diverse base of movies and TV shows, and as our  membership continues to grow, we’ll be able to add further to the content library.  Lately, we’ve offered  members new movies from our existing deals, including Pay TV 1 and 2 titles like “Insidious”, “Horrid  Henry: The Movie”, and “Angels & Demons”, as well as iconic catalog titles, such as, “Pulp Fiction”, “The  Godfather”, and “Top Gun”.  In the coming months, Netflix will be the Pay TV 1 UK home of “21 Jump Street” and “The Hobbit” from  MGM, “The Woman in Black” from Momentum and the recent monster hit “Hunger Games” from  Lionsgate. Collectively, our upcoming offerings account for 20% of UK box office year to date, compared  to our competitor LOVEFiLM, whose deals we estimate account for around 6%.  Our TV offering is also strong, with previous seasons of current shows from the major U.S. networks and  three key local channels. We are particularly excited to be the UK and Ireland TV premiere destination  for shows like, “Breaking Bad” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”.  From our experience to date, we continue to believe our biggest competitors will be Sky Movies and Sky  Atlantic (and potentially Sky’s yet-to-be-launched Now TV streaming service), as well as LOVEFiLM.   Without details on consumer pricing or content selection, it remains unclear whether Sky’s Now TV will  be a meaningful competitor. Ultimately, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in the UK and  Ireland based on our content selection as well as our superior streaming technology.   If the UK Competition Commission eventually forces Sky Movies to not control the Pay TV 1 output from  all six major studios, that then may provide an opportunity for Netflix to bid earlier for major studio  deals than otherwise would have been the case.  It is premature to know how it will play out.   In the UK and Ireland we launched with our most broad-scale Facebook integration to date, and are  pleased with the level of consumer engagement.   Social TV show and movie discovery is heavily used by  our Facebook connected members.    Canada  Canada continues to be a strong market for Netflix.  Member growth remained healthy in Q1, and we  ended the quarter with nearly double the members we had a year ago.      6  Our on-going investment in new content for Canada is driving increased engagement and hours viewed.  Just this month, through our Pay TV 1 deals we’ve added such blockbusters as, “Thor”, and  “Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon”, with “Kung-Fu Panda II” and “Captain America” coming soon.  We are also licensing for our members some great Canadian content, including “Dragon’s Den”, “Arctic  Air”, and “Mr. D,” three of the top rated shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC).  Even with our continued content investment, we anticipate a small contribution profit in Canada in Q2  and will remain profitable in this market going forward. This is a quarter earlier than our January  expectations for Canadian profitability, made possible by the continued strength of member growth and  increased efficiency of our marketing spend. Long-term, we intend to steadily increase our contribution  margin in much the same way as we are doing for our U.S. streaming business.   Latin America  As mentioned in our January investor letter, Latin America differs significantly from our other markets.  While there is limited current OTT streaming competition in the region (different from the UK), this lack  of OTT competition means that the concept of on-demand streaming video (outside of piracy and  YouTube) is nascent, requiring us to do more work in driving consumer understanding and acceptance of  our streaming service.  In addition, Latin America presents unique infrastructure challenges relative to  our other markets; namely, low device penetration, under-developed Internet infrastructure and  relatively low credit card usage as well as general consumer payment challenges for ecommerce.  For  example, many banks turn down all ecommerce debit card transactions due to fraud risk, making it a  more challenging environment than our other markets.  To offset these challenges and improve the consumer experience, we have been continually expanding  the content offering. In Q1, we added new series to our TV offerings including, “Dexter”, “Ancient  Aliens” and “Charmed”, as well a host of popular feature films including, “Twilight: New Moon”,  “Gnomeo & Juliet”, “The Incredibles”, “Insidious”,  “Couples Retreat”, and “Saving Private Perez” (the  top Mexican film of 2011). For Q2, we are beginning to ramp up the number of Pay TV 1 titles on our  service, including Best Picture winner “The Artist” in June; and “Something Borrowed”, and “From Prada  to Nada”, during the quarter.     In Q1, we increased our subtitle coverage to nearly 100% of non-kids English language content (in  addition to previously available dubbing) to accommodate varying viewing preferences. Finally, we’re  very focused on optimizing our payment processing to continue to improve free trial conversions to paid  members, as well as exploring adding new payment methods to expand the addressable market of  consumers.  Our revenue and membership is growing in Latin America, and we are rapidly learning.   The odds of us  building a large, profitable business in Latin America are very good, but it will take longer than we  initially thought.         7  Total International Results & Outlook    In Q1, international revenue of $43 million was up more than 3X from a year ago, and in-line with  expectations. Contribution loss of $103 million was better than anticipated due to slightly higher  revenue combined with lower than expected content, subtitling and marketing expenses.  In connection  with our Latin American market, we incurred increased subtitling costs in Q1 which have been  capitalized into the content library ($5 million, net of amortization).  Last year, such costs were  immaterial and expensed as incurred.  We expect subtitling costs to continue to be meaningful as we  launch additional non-English markets in the future.  So, our forecast incorrectly assumed $5 million in  expense.    In Q2, we expect Canada to deliver a small profit, and the growth of members and revenue in Latin  America and the UK and Ireland to lower the contribution loss in each of those markets. In total,  international contribution loss is expected to sequentially improve to a range of between ($98) and  ($86) million.   Our early success in Canada – sustainably profitable less than 2 years after launch – is probably unusual  given the proximity of Canada to the U.S. and the broad pre-launch awareness of our brand.  As a result,  we expect Latin America and the UK and Ireland to take longer than 8 quarters to reach sustained profits  as we build membership and invest in content improvements.   Given our expected return to global profitability in Q2, and how well we’ve been received in the UK,  we’ve decided to open an additional attractive European market in Q4 of this year.   Assuming  continued success, and additional markets we can enter with confidence, we expect to roughly match  the roll-out of new markets to global profitability for the foreseeable future.    DVD  DVD members declined this quarter to 10.1 million, slightly better than our expectations. About 7  million of these 10 million also subscribe to our streaming service.  Going forward, we believe DVD will  continue to decline but at a slower pace than the past few quarters.      The domestic DVD segment delivered $146 million of contribution profit in Q1, representing a 46%  contribution margin. We expect contribution margin to be roughly flat in coming quarters.   Product Improvement & Partnering  We are constantly working to improve the Netflix experience so our members can easily sign up, find  something great to watch and then relax and enjoy our service.  Q1 was no exception in terms of  continual improvements to the service.   As mentioned above, we improved our Latin American customer experience by increasing subtitle  coverage to nearly one hundred percent of non-kids content, while in the UK and Ireland, we launched  our most thorough Facebook integration to date, allowing members to share what they watch on      8  Facebook and giving them the ability to get great viewing ideas from their friends. We also continued  our efforts to better serve families, launching our “Just for Kids” feature on the PS3 as a follow up to the  successful launches of this feature on the website, Apple TV, and Wii.   Finally, based on successful test  results, we rolled out a smarter personalization algorithm to determine members’ Top 10 suggested title  lists.       In March, we launched a deeper integration with the Apple TV, allowing consumers to sign up for Netflix  directly on device and pay via their iTunes account.  We’ve been very pleased that this simplification for  new users has been popular, and that the integration has gone so well.  Members who sign up through  Apple TV are full Netflix members, and can use Netflix on multiple devices. The Apple TV relationship  covers all of our markets.       Many companies like Apple already have a billing relationship with millions of people, including ISPs,  major retailers, MVPDs, and others.   In cases where these firms have an efficient means to generate  demand for Netflix, and can provide a very simple way to add a Netflix line item to the existing bill, it  may make sense for us to let them bill on our behalf.   We’ll take it slowly; we must make sure we’ve got  the right customer support and financial integration, while maintaining a direct relationship with our  members, to ensure the member experience is actually simpler.  Our Apple TV integration is one  example where we have accomplished that.     Original Programming  When we embarked on original programming, it was a strategic experiment.   We’ve gained enough  confidence and perspective that we now view it as a strategic expansion.   In particular, we are now  treating it as a capability we should build, like international, to achieve our long-term ambitions.   What  is still uncertain is when or whether we will take it beyond 5% of our large content spend.   We’ll take it  year by year, and see how good we can get at originals for our members.     One way to think of originals is in terms of brand halo.   If we are able to generate critical success for our  originals, it will elevate our consumer brand and drive incremental members to the service.   That took  HBO nearly a decade to accomplish, so we don’t expect overnight results.  The breadth of media  coverage we already get, though, for the highly anticipated new season of “Arrested Development”, as  well as for “Lilyhammer” and “House of Cards”, has been great.      Another way to think of originals is vertical integration; can we remove enough inefficiency from the  show launch process that we can acquire content more cheaply through licensing shows directly rather  than going through distributors who have already launched a show?  Our on-demand and personalized  platform means that we don’t have to assemble a mass audience at say, 8pm on Sunday, to watch the  first episode.  Instead, we can give producers the opportunity to deliver us great serialized shows and  we can cost-efficiently build demand over time, with members discovering these new franchises much  in the same way they’ve discovered and come to love shows like “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.”  In this  regard, we are happy to report that in terms of cost per viewing hour, which is how we evaluate content      9  efficiency, “Lilyhammer” so far performs in line with similar premium exclusive content that we  currently license.  Finally, a third way to think about originals is as a hedge, in case, say, FX chooses not to license us prior  seasons of their next hit as good as “Sons of Anarchy”.  FX in this case would seek to monetize prior  seasons of their next hit in parallel to how HBO does, in other words, only on “FX GO”.    As long as we  can better monetize prior seasons, through both scale and technology, than anyone else, then this  scenario is not likely, except from a premium TV competitor like HBO that is strategically motivated to  impede our growth.    We know we have a lot to learn in the originals area.   In terms of early results, we exceeded our targets  on “Lilyhammer” in terms of PR, viewing, and critical acclaim.   The show has driven millions of hours  viewed, is rated highly (4 out of 5 stars on average) and generated hundreds of millions of consumer  impressions with a comparatively small PR and marketing spend. In the quarter, we announced another  original premiering in 2013, “Hemlock Grove”, a one-hour 13 episode series from Eli Roth and Gaumont  International TV based on Brian McGreevy’s gothic horror novel.    As we build our capability in originals, we will have some advantages relative to our competitors.  Namely, we have extensive user viewing history and ratings data to allow us to better understand  potential appeal of future programs, as well as a very broad and already segmented audience. At the  same time, we don’t face the same pressure as linear or ad-supported online networks to deliver  ratings. Finally, we should be able to use our size and international scale to bring the best original and  exclusive content from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. This is a real advantage over  our regional competitors.   Global Profitability: Q1 Results & Outlook  Q1 net loss of ($5) million, and ($0.08) per share, was better than our expectations, predominantly  driven by the outperformance in both domestic and international streaming contribution profit, in  addition to slightly lower global Tech & Dev and G&A costs than anticipated.  Looking forward to Q2, sequential growth in domestic streaming contribution profit will offset the  decline in DVD contribution profit from Q1, while improvements in profitability in each of the  international markets will reduce the international losses by approximately $11 million (based on the  midpoint of guidance). As a result, we are forecasting a much earlier return to global profitability than  anticipated on a Q2 net income / (loss) range of ($6) to $8 million. The improvement in the outlook is a  result of continued member growth (both domestically and internationally), as well as increased  efficiency of our content and marketing spending.  As described above, looking past Q2 and our expected return to international expansion this year, we  expect to invest the growing profits from our domestic business in additional global expansion in order  to both position ourselves to be the first to scale in each of our international markets, as well as  expedite reaching such global scale that will allow us to license global content rights economically.       10    Free Cash Flow   In Q1, despite our net loss of ($5) million, we generated positive FCF of $2 million. Significant sources of  cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation, depreciation  expense in excess of PP&E purchases, and accrued interest on our notes, which more than offset cash  payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense) and cash payments for taxes relative to the P&L  benefit for income taxes.   In general, FCF and net income track each other reasonably closely with the primary exception of  payments for original content.  Originals will not materially impact free cash flow until the second half of  this year and will ramp in 2013 as we add more original programs.  We finished the quarter with $805 million in cash and equivalents.

As we grow,  we are trying to balance prudence and ambition while keeping a strong focus on member satisfaction.  We work hard every day to make our service even better.   Our rapid return to profitability, enabling  further international expansion, is very gratifying.

Members who are on payment hold will no longer be counted as members,  while members who cancel mid-period will be counted until their service ceases at their period end. We  estimate the net effect of these changes was that we are reporting 200k fewer domestic streaming  members than we would otherwise report in Q1. There is no effect on revenue from this change.    Use of Non-GAAP Measures  This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free  cash flow.  Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities.  However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income,  operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in  tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements     This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding improvements to our service and growth in viewing  hours; growth trends, including member acquisition,  contribution profit and margin as well as content  acquisition; international segment performance, including Canadian contribution profit and Latin  America challenges as well as content investment;  DVD member losses and contribution profit; return  to global profitability; content acquisition, including original programming and specific title availability;  competition; free cash flow and usage of cash; our member growth, including total and paid; net  additions for 2012; revenue, and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause  actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and  retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; our ability to build back our brand; the  continued availability of content on terms and conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in  service on our website or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service;  competition and widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 10, 2012. We undertake no obligation to update  forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press  release.      13          Netflix, Inc.

If Netflix is going to add 7 million domestic streaming net additions in 2012, and we added that many  net adds in 2010, then it is natural, but incorrect, to think that the seasonal distribution of quarterly net  adds should be the same in both years.    But, in 2012, Netflix has a larger starting membership base than it did in 2010, and also has a higher  gross adds, higher churn business for getting to those 7 million net additions.  As the math below shows, if Netflix generates 7 million net adds in 2012 (same as 2010), it is inherent  that there is much more seasonality in the 2012 quarterly net adds than in 2010, even though the  seasonality of gross adds is unchanged.    In the example below we’ve simplified and abstracted the numbers to illustrate the principles.     In the first model we show the seasonality of 5,000 net additions on a base of 10,000, and in the second  model we show the increased seasonality of 5,000 net additions on a base of 20,000.   Both models have  the same churn and same seasonality of gross adds; yet in the case of a smaller starting base (model #1  with 10,000 starting members), Q2 represents 14% of annual net adds, whereas with a larger member  base (model #2 with 20,000 starting members),  Q2 represents only 7% of annual net adds.      The above table holds churn constant between the two models.  But in 2012 we have higher churn and  higher gross adds than in 2010.   The increased seasonality of net adds is even more pronounced with  these factored in.  The table below has the same net adds (5,000) as the two models above, and the same seasonality of  gross adds.  But now we add higher churn and higher gross adds.

       " 'Investor-Letter-Q2-2012-07': \"1    July 24th, 2012      Dear Fellow Shareholders,  In Q2, we achieved financial performance in the top half of our guidance in nearly every metric, and  have returned to profitability.    66 months ago, we launched Netflix streaming in the US with limited selection.   Now, we have 24  million domestic streaming members and an incredible selection of TV shows and movies.  Networks  that license us prior season TV shows are in several cases benefiting from record audience numbers in  the current season, partly due to the availability and promotion of prior seasons on Netflix. We are  growing our business, and helping to grow the entire industry.    22 months ago, we launched our first international market:  Canada.  Since then we’ve grown to over  10% of Canadian households, made substantial increases in our content selection, and achieved enough  scale to begin to generate contribution profits.    10 months ago, we launched Netflix in Latin America.  Recently we surpassed one million members in  the region and announced that one of the year’s biggest films, “The Hunger Games”, would debut on  our service only five months after its theatrical release.  With a population ten times the size of Canada,  Latin America remains a huge opportunity for us.   6 months ago, we launched Netflix in the UK and Ireland, and today we are one million members strong.    We believe we have pulled ahead of LOVEFiLM in every important streaming-related metric. Going  forward, competing effectively with Sky is our core and substantial challenge.     This growth in each of our markets reflects our investment in an easy-to-use personalized selection  experience, ever more compelling content, and higher quality streaming delivery.   Device by device,  title by title, network by network, market by market, we are constantly improving our service.   Q3 has begun strongly for us, and we expect to be profitable again in Q3.   In Q4, we will launch our next international market, which will drive us temporarily back into the red.    We have enormous challenges ahead, and no doubt will have further ups and downs as we pioneer  Internet television.  We are making progress in every market we serve, and see a once-in-a-generation  opportunity ahead to build the world’s most popular TV show and movie service.    Our summary results follow:           2      Domestic Streaming  Q2 Results & Outlook  As we forecasted and explained in our April letter, domestic net additions will be more seasonal in 2012  compared to 2010 (2011 is an anomaly due to our mid-year price changes).  Roughly speaking, we would  therefore expect our net adds to be about equal to 2010 in Q1 and Q3, lower in Q2, and higher in Q4,  even given no change in the seasonality of gross adds.      Q2 came in as we expected, which is about 50% fewer domestic net adds than in Q2 2010.   For Q3 quarter-to-date, our domestic net additions are very nearly the same as Q3 2010 over the  comparable partial period.  In that quarter two years ago, we finished with 1.8 million domestic net  additions. However, in the middle of that quarter, we launched Netflix on the iPhone to great reception,   (in millions except per share data) Q2 '11 Q3 '11 Q4 '11 Q1 '12 Q2 '12 Domestic Streaming: Net Subscription Additions  -    -   0.22 1.74 0.53 Total Subscriptions  -   21.45 21.67 23.41 23.94 Paid Subscriptions  -   20.51 20.15 22.02 22.69 Revenue  -    -   $            476  $            507  $            533  Contribution Profit  -    -   $              52  $              67  $              83  Contribution Margin  -    -   10.9% 13.2% 15.6% International Streaming: Net Subscription Additions 0.16 0.51 0.38 1.21 0.56 Total Subscriptions 0.97 1.48 1.86 3.07 3.62 Paid Subscriptions 0.86 0.99 1.45 2.41 3.02 Revenue  $              19  $              23  $              29  $              43  $              65  Contribution Profit (Loss)  $              (9)  $            (23)  $            (60)  $          (103)  $            (89) Domestic DVD: Net Subscription Additions  -    -   (2.76) (1.08) (0.85) Total Subscriptions  -   13.93 11.17 10.09 9.24 Paid Subscriptions  -   13.81 11.04 9.96 9.15 Revenue  -    -   $            370  $            320  $            291  Contribution Profit  -    -   $            194  $            146  $            134  Contribution Margin  -    -   52.4% 45.6% 46.0% Global: Revenue  $            789  $            822  $            876  $            870  $            889  Net Income (Loss)  $              68  $              62  $              35  $              (5)  $                6  EPS  $           1.26  $           1.16  $           0.64  $         (0.08)  $           0.11  Free Cash Flow  $              60  $              14  $              34  $                2  $              11  Shares (FD) 53.9 53.9 55.4 55.5 58.8     3    and we don’t have an equivalent launch this quarter. Moreover, this quarter the Olympics are likely to  have a negative impact on Netflix viewing and sign-ups.  So, our Q3 guidance is 1 million to 1.8 million  domestic net adds. If we finish Q3 in the high end of that range, we would remain on track for 7 million  domestic net additions for the year; otherwise it would be challenging to achieve that goal by year end.   In either case, we are generating impressive growth this year in our most developed market.    Our per-member viewing continues to rise on a year-over-year basis.   As our service improves,  members are choosing more often to enjoy Netflix.  The more members enjoy Netflix, the longer they  stay with us, and the more passionately they evangelize Netflix to their friends.     Our reputation with our members and their likelihood to recommend the Netflix service is steadily  improving.  Our original thesis was three years to full brand recovery (subsequent to the DVD-related  price increases last summer), and that seems correct so far.     Our domestic streaming contribution margin improved 200+ basis points sequentially for the second  consecutive quarter to 15.6% (up from 13.2% in Q1 and 10.9% in Q4), surpassing the year end  contribution margin target we outlined back in Q4 2011. The Q2 margin expansion was predominantly  driven by the planned sequential decline in marketing expense, while content expenses grew in line with  revenue (as compared to Q1). For Q3, our guidance implies a further 100 bps expansion in contribution  margin.   Looking out beyond Q3, we will continue to target gradual margin expansion of about 100 bps  per quarter, but any given quarter may see flatness sequentially as we accommodate lumpiness in  content library additions and the seasonality of subscriber net adds.    Domestic Content   Every quarter, we add fresh film and TV titles and episodes to our domestic content library, and we  continue to see good returns on these investments in the form of increased hours viewed by our  members.  Q2 domestic median hours viewed per member grew substantially year-over-year and total  hours were at record levels.   In the past, we have explained that the evolution of video streaming services to a large extent reflects  the legacy of television networks: namely, a reliance on exclusive content as a differentiator. Consistent  with this practice, we have increasingly licensed content on an exclusive basis, including titles such as  “Mad Men”, “Breaking Bad” and “Gossip Girl”.  This quarter we continued this practice, further  differentiating our service through a multi-year exclusive agreement with Warner Bros. for complete  previous seasons of hit shows “Pretty Little Liars” and “The Lying Game”.  Exclusivity on the film side is also relevant, and we continue to pursue both exclusive and non-exclusive  deals with our partners.  There are many different kinds of exclusivity in this area.  With EPIX, we  currently have exclusivity for online distribution, but EPIX is increasingly distributed by MVPD and TV  Everywhere.   Our online exclusivity expires shortly, but our agreement to carry EPIX content non- exclusively runs through mid-2013. On the strength of Paramount’s and Lionsgate’s film slates in 2011  and 2012, EPIX has become a great product and we look forward to our ongoing relationship.       4     We continue pursuing innovative deals with others.  One such deal is an output arrangement with The  Weinstein Company that will allow us to have an exclusive window for theatrical titles that will begin  after the expiration of their first Pay window.  This first-of-a-kind deal will give Netflix members access  to all Weinstein theatrical films in what had traditionally been the first Free TV window -- just 12 months  from the start of the Pay TV window, as opposed to the traditional holdback of nearly 8 years. Among  the titles we will soon have are last year’s Academy Award winner, “The King’s Speech” and the highly  acclaimed “Blue Valentine”.  Next year we’ll get “My Week with Marilyn” and “The Iron Lady”.  In the meantime, our current feature film offering is better than ever with the arrival of “Thor”,  “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”, and “Immortals” which, together, generated more than $1.2 billion  in domestic box office.  In the coming months, we’ll see additional great titles including crowd pleasers  like, “Captain America”, “Abduction”, “Super 8” and “Margin Call” along with critically acclaimed films  like this year’s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, “The Artist”, plus “Albert Nobbs” and  “Bernie”.   Over time, we will have one of the best feature film offerings in the market as more than one  third of the US box office generated year-to-date are from titles that will flow through our current deals  including “The Hunger Games”, “The Avengers” and “The Lorax” from major studios and “Act of Valor”,  “Mirror, Mirror” and “The Grey” from our mini-major partners.  We have often said that our licensing of complete back seasons of on-air TV series is not only a great  experience for Netflix members, but can help build the audience for new seasons of these series. Last  quarter, the audience for season five of “Mad Men” swelled subsequent to prior seasons becoming  available on Netflix. Last week, the fifth season of “Breaking Bad” debuted to record numbers, up 14%  from last year’s premiere, no doubt buttressed by new viewers who were introduced to the series on  Netflix.  “Sons of Anarchy” on FX and “The Walking Dead” on AMC are additional examples of shows that  have seen season over season viewership growth with the availability of the complete series on Netflix.  Our unique ability to help members catch up at whatever point in the life of a series that suits them is  just one way we add value to our partners when they license their content to Netflix.   Domestic Competition   As we’ve explained in the past, we compete for consumers’ viewing time with a variety of video services,  including linear TV, DVRs, over-the-top (OTT) pure plays, and authenticated streaming offerings of the  MVPDs and cable networks (TV Everywhere).   We have yet to see HuluPlus or Amazon Prime Instant Video gain meaningful traction relative to our  viewing hours, but as we continue to build a domestic profit stream they are likely to increase their  efforts to gain viewing share.  Redbox Instant by Verizon, once they launch, will face a big challenge to  break into the top 3 of subscription streaming services.  We believe our biggest long-term competition for viewing hours will come from MVPDs and cable  networks, both directly and through their TV Everywhere offerings.  MVPDs continue to improve their      5    offering, and Comcast’s X1 interface, shown off at the recent cable show, is an impressive and leading  example of this work.  Our task is to keep raising the bar by operating on Internet pace, so that by the  time Comcast broadly rolls out X1 over the coming years, we’ll be another generation ahead in member- pleasing experiences.    As for HBO, they continue to do great work with HBO GO, which is now available to most US households  that subscribe to the premium service.   While we compete for content and viewing time with HBO, it is  also possible we will find opportunities to work together – just as we do with other networks.    Consumers who are passionate about movies and TV shows are quite willing to subscribe to multiple  services.     International Streaming   We added nearly 0.6 million international streaming members in Q2, ending the quarter with 3.6 million  international members. Compared to Q1, average paid subscribers increased 41% in the quarter as we  continued to attract new members and convert free trials into paying subscribers. Our total  international subscriber base came in slightly lower than our forecast in April as we implemented  several up-front checks to validate consumer payment methods in Latin America. These changes  reduced our free trials relative to the forecast, but had limited impact on paid subscriber numbers. Our  international segment now represents 13% of total Netflix streaming members, and slightly over half of  the streaming net additions in the quarter.    UK and Ireland   Following our successful launch in the UK and Ireland in Q1, we are encouraged by the continued strong  growth of the service and today have one million members.  This growth has been driven, in part, by our  investments in content.  Over the past quarter, we have added great movies to the service, including the  critically acclaimed “Drive” and the family comedy “Zookeeper” in the Pay 1 TV window and recent  blockbusters “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs”, “Transformers” and “Mission Impossible III”.  We  have also strengthened our TV offering.  Over the past three months, we launched all six seasons of the  hit series “Lost”, premiered the third season of the gritty drama “Breaking Bad”, and became the  exclusive home in the UK and Ireland of the indie comedy series “Portlandia”.  We will continue to expand and refresh our content offering in the coming quarter.  Notable new titles  will include the action-adventure film “Abduction”, the sentimental buddy comedy “50/50” and  blockbusters “2012” and “Iron Man 2.”  Through our recently announced deal with Twentieth Century  Fox, we will be making available several top US TV series in Q3, including “Sons of Anarchy”, “The Killing”  and the Emmy-winning “Modern Family”.  Subscribers can also look forward to the next seasons of  “Breaking Bad” and “Damages” exclusively on Netflix. As with all of our markets, our content additions  are targeted to deliver incremental viewing, and therefore drive higher engagement and retention of  our members.       6    Looking past Q3, we feel our existing partnerships with local broadcasters and producers, US studios and  networks, and independent partners will continue to provide us access to compelling content.  For  example, our upcoming Pay 1 feature films account for 16% of UK Box Office year-to-date, compared to  an estimated 5% for LOVEFiLM’s streaming service.   When we launched, we said Sky would be our primary competitor in the UK, and now we potentially  face increased competition from Sky’s new OTT service “Now TV” at £15 per month, more than double  our price. This is Sky’s first foray into a pure-play OTT streaming product and will likely be marketed  aggressively. Our content libraries are mutually exclusive with no overlap of titles; as such, many  households may subscribe to both services.   Canada   Our Canadian service continues to grow well – in both subscribers and hours viewed. Similar to trends in  the US, Q2 median hours viewed per member were up year-over-year in Canada. We have movies in the  first pay TV window from Paramount and Fox and our members are currently enjoying hit films like “Rise  of the Planet of the Apes”, “Mr. Popper’s Penguins” and “Kung Fu Panda 2”. As in the US, the first four  seasons of “Breaking Bad” and all six seasons of “Lost” are setting viewing records in Canada for us.  We  achieved a small contribution profit in Canada in Q2 and expect to remain profitable in this market going  forward, as we manage our content and marketing expenses to grow more slowly than members and  revenue. We intend to steadily increase our contribution margin in much the same way as we are doing  for our US streaming business.   Latin America  In less than a year since expanding our service to Latin America, we are excited that we have more than  one million members. At the same time, given the huge market opportunity, we remain focused on  accelerating our growth by overcoming some of the many unique challenges in the region, namely, low  device penetration, an under-developed Internet infrastructure and consumer payment challenges for  ecommerce.  We are making progress in the area of payments. We have modified our sign-up flow to improve free  trial to paid subscriber conversion, and are in the process of expanding payment options in Mexico and  Brazil.  We are also closely tracking the performance of our content library to figure out the right formula for  adding content that results in higher viewing and therefore greater member engagement, retention and  positive word of mouth.  We’re encouraged that the content additions we’ve made are having an  impact.   Our newest Mexican members are now watching more Netflix than their counterparts in the  US, Canada, or the UK.         7    Our content in the region keeps getting better. Global blockbuster “The Hunger Games” will debut on  our service in August, only five months after its worldwide theatrical release and on the same date as it  will be released on DVD and VOD in the region.  Additionally, our new deal with FOX has given Latin  American members access to hit shows such as, “Glee”, “How I Met Your Mother”, “24” and “Prison  Break”. Additionally, we are adding episodes of “South Park” and other on-air TV Series, such as,  “Revenge”, “Once upon a Time”, “Parenthood”, “Parks and Recreation” and “Franklin & Bash”. The  fourth season of “Breaking Bad” debuts for us in Latin America in September.  While challenges remain in the region, with subscribers and revenue growing, we are on-track to  capture the big opportunity that the region represents.   Next International Market   Given our return to global profitability this quarter and our continued success in the UK, we announced  last quarter that we’ve decided to open an additional attractive European market in Q4 of this year. We  will have more to say about this market later in Q3.    Total International Results & Outlook     Total international revenue of $65 million in Q2 increased 50% sequentially driven by the overall growth  in international members and the conversion of free trials to paid subscribers in both Latin America and  the UK and Ireland.  Total contribution loss of $89 million improved by $13 million compared to Q1, as  subscriber revenue growth exceeded the growth of content expenses while marketing expenses  declined post-UK launch.    Looking forward to Q3, we are guiding to a small increase in the international loss relative to Q2. Similar  to our experience in Canada last fall, the market opportunity we are experiencing in the UK is compelling  enough that we intend to grow our content spend to expand the library and to drive additional growth  in subscribers and viewing. Ultimately, our long-term goal in each market is to become the first  streaming service to reach scale, allowing us to achieve profitability and to expand margins over the  long-term.     We expect to exceed 4 million total international members in Q3, with another half million net additions  in the quarter (at the mid-point of guidance), consistent with Q2’s net additions.  Our outlook assumes  that viewing of the summer Olympics in July will dampen acquisitions across all of our markets.   DVD  DVD subscriptions declined this quarter to 9.2 million, in-line with our expectations. About 6.7 million of  these 9.2 million also subscribe to our streaming service. The domestic DVD segment delivered $134  million of contribution profit in Q2, representing a 46% contribution margin, comparable to the Q1      8    margin. Going forward, we believe DVD member declines will continue to moderate, while contribution  margin will be roughly flat for the remainder of the year.  The first round of USPS processing center  reductions took effect in the first week of July.  So far, we see minimal service related impact from these  reductions.  Original Programming  Progress continues in the production of our previously announced original programs: “House of Cards”  began filming in Baltimore in April, “Arrested Development” and “Orange Is the New Black” are in the  writing phase, and principal photography has just begun on “Hemlock Grove”.  We look forward to the  debut of the entire first season of “House of Cards” in early 2013, and “Arrested Development” after  that. Additionally, we expect to deliver a second season of “Lillyhammer” in 2013 and our original  content team is working on expanding this lineup further.   Product Improvement  Our technology and development spending reflects our continued investments in improving the Netflix  experience.  In Q2, these investments produced improved Netflix players for both PC and Mac, as well as  the continued expansion of our “Just for Kids” feature, already on PC, Mac, Wii, PS3 and Apple TV, and  coming soon to the Xbox and iPad. In addition, we rolled out globally the much improved catalog sorting  algorithms that we initially launched in Q1 in the US, and added incremental search capabilities (such as  search by actor or director) to the PS3, with plans to roll-out this feature to other devices quickly.    Given our size and growth, it now makes economic sense for Netflix to have its own content delivery  network (CDN). As a result, we recently announced that we are enabling ISPs to get Netflix video data  from Open Connect, a single-purpose Netflix CDN. We’ll continue to work with our commercial CDN  partners for the next few years, but eventually our data will be largely served by Open Connect. Like  commercial CDNs, Open Connect will provide the Netflix data at no cost to the locations the ISP desires,  or ISPs can choose to get the Netflix data at common Internet exchanges. About 10% of Netflix data is  already being served by Open Connect.   Global Profitability:  Q2 Results & Outlook  We achieved our goal of returning to global profitability this quarter by posting $6 million of net income,  and $0.11 EPS. Compared to Q1, margin expansion of the domestic streaming segment delivered an  incremental $17 million of contribution profit, more than offsetting the $12 million decline of DVD  contribution profit. Meanwhile, international losses moderated by $13 million and global operating  expenses (Technology & Development and G & A) were flat relative to Q1.     Our highly profitable US business, both streaming and DVD, is funding our international expansion. We  believe this is the right long-term approach.  In Q3, we expect to be profitable, while with the launch of  a fourth international market in Q4, we will move to a consolidated loss.       9        Free Cash Flow   In Q2, positive free cash flow of $11 million was roughly equivalent to our consolidated net income of $6  million and improved quarter-over-quarter largely because of the sequential improvement in net  income. Significant sources of cash flow in the quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock  compensation, depreciation expense in excess of PP&E purchases, and miscellaneous increases to  accounts payable and accrued expenses, which more than offset cash payments for content (in excess of  the P&L expense) and our bi-annual cash payment for interest on our notes.  In general, free cash flow and net income track each other reasonably closely with the primary  exception of payments for certain content deals (including original content and some output deals). We  expect content payments to cause free cash flow to trail net income in Q3. The use of cash for originals  will increase in Q4 and 2013 as we add more original programs.   We finished the quarter with $813 million in cash and equivalents.   New CMO - Kelly Bennett   We were excited yesterday to announce the appointment of Kelly Bennett as our Chief Marketing  Officer. Kelly comes to Netflix after nearly a decade at Warner Bros. where he was most recently Vice  President Interactive, World Wide Marketing with the pictures group, leading international online  campaigns for Warner Bros. movies. Before that Kelly ran digital marketing for Warner Bros. Pictures in  Europe, the Middle East and Africa and worked in promotion and business development in the  company.

Our technology and our content are both huge advantages in getting us to scale;  with scale comes further ability to invest.   We know our shareholders are depending on us to succeed at  our global expansion, market by market, and eventually return to substantial global profits.  Our growing  US streaming contribution profit stream shows what is possible.   We can’t wait to serve a global  audience with an amazing Internet video experience.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities.  However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income,  operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in  tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements     This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding improvements to our service, expected profitability, our  launch timing of our next international market,  subscriber growth, including seasonality and 2012 net  additions, brand recovery, domestic contribution margin expansion, content acquisition, including  specific title availability, competition, international segment performance, including continued  investment and availability of content in each market, Canadian profitability and contribution margin;  international losses, content spend and subscriber growth, DVD member losses and contribution profit;  original programming expansion; data delivery from our own CDN service; free cash flow and usage of  cash; our member growth, including total and paid; revenue, and contribution profit (loss) for both  domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings per  share for the third quarter of 2012. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; our  ability to build back our brand; the continued availability of content on terms and conditions acceptable  to us; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer  usage of our service; disruption in service on our website and systems or with third-party computer  systems that help us operate our service; competition and widespread consumer adoption of different  modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking  statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual  Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 10, 2012. We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this press release.              13            Netflix, Inc.

We have compelling exclusive content, an outstanding member experience, and a brand that stands for  high quality streaming entertainment. These strengths, combined with the industry-wide forces of  improving Internet devices and bandwidth, are fueling our rapid growth around the world.

For Q4, our guidance is for our U.S. membership base to increase to between 26.4 and 27.1 million, up  more than 20% year over year from where we started the year at 21.7 million members.     In Q3 we grew our contribution margin to 16.4%.  For Q4, we are targeting 17%, an improvement of 60  basis points quarter over quarter and 600 basis points year over year from 10.9% last Q4.      Membership satisfaction is very high, as seen in two key metrics: we increased our per member viewing  in Q3 by more than 30% (year over year) to record highs by improving our content and member  experience; and our voluntary churn is generally the lowest it has ever been.1 In contrast, involuntary  churn has been increasing as we grow more mainstream and attract more lower-income households.    Gross acquisitions continue to grow on a year over year basis.  We also continue to see strength in  repeat customers.     While we are not growing membership as fast as in 2010, we think that over time nearly all U.S.  households will be broadband households, nearly all video will be Internet video, and that as our  content and member experience continue to improve faster than competitors, our long-term domestic  market opportunity remains 2-3x that of linear HBO.    Domestic Streaming Content     Our members continue to enjoy TV shows from Netflix in huge numbers. About two thirds of our  viewing is now episodic content, and about one third is movies. Both are important to us and our  members.      For on-demand movies, consumers today have many options at home, including $1.20 per night DVD  from Redbox, DVR-recorded movies from premium and basic networks, DVD purchase and transactional  on-demand offerings, like VOD or EST.  In comparison, Netflix has better content discovery, is simpler to  use, and is on all Internet screens.  So our movie offering is substantially, but not amazingly, better than  other movie options for consumers.                                                      1 There are two components of churn/retention:  “voluntary” which is members cancelling their service, and  “involuntary” which is Netflix cancelling their service due to our inability to collect from their debit/credit card.     For any set of members, churn declines over time as one would expect.  Therefore, to detect trends, we look at  churn/retention at various points in time across our members’ lifetimes, such as month 6 to month 7, for example.       3      For serialized TV shows, however, we do offer an amazingly better experience, because our members  can start right from the pilot episode of season one and watch multiple seasons at their own pace.   Neither Redbox DVD nor the DVR truly offers this capability.  Buying expensive boxed-set DVDs or even  more expensive seasons of $2 episodes on VOD are the only other options for enjoying this “discover a  show” behavior.  Our high relative advantage in TV shows is part of why our viewing is now about two  thirds TV shows.      Of our top ten TV shows, six are only on Netflix, and not available on Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video,  or HBO GO. The ratio is slightly higher for our top 50 TV shows. We have a very unique and compelling  offering.      While we were interested in keeping Epix movies exclusive to Netflix, we and Epix could not reach terms  that made sense to both of us.  We could better spend the incremental dollars on high profile TV titles.   The movies from Epix constitute only about 5% of our viewing, and we continue to have them, on a non- exclusive basis. We will be a bidder for future fully exclusive studio output deals for movies as they  become available.    In general, to maintain a great service and low prices, we have to be choosy about what we are licensing  for Netflix. Given the high volume of programming available on Netflix, titles come into and out of  license nearly every day. Suppliers, of course, are incentivized to talk about how important their  particular offering is to our service, and it can be concerning to investors to read stories of content non- renewal.     We strive to offer our subscribers exceptional levels of high quality premium content choices. In order to  do that, we have to make sure that relative to the cost of that content, we are making wise  programming choices. Overall, Netflix now has a more engaging mix of movies and TV shows than it has  ever had and continues to improve, as seen in our considerable growth in per member viewing. Our  licensing teams are expert programmers informed by more than a decade of rich data on viewer  preferences and viewing habits which allows them to license an overall mix of compelling content to  uniquely please Netflix members.     Our Netflix Originals are an integral part of our global content strategy, and we’ll go into more detail  about them below.    International Streaming    We added nearly 0.7 million international streaming members in Q3, ending the quarter with 4.3 million  international members. Net additions were at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting stronger  than forecasted subscriber growth in each of our international markets.       4      Nordics    We launched our service in the Nordics (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) just last week, and  have been very pleased by the positive reception.      Since this is our fourth regional launch, we were able to apply what we’ve learned from our previous  market launches to optimize the content programming library and marketing.    In our first week of service, we attracted more free trial members than we did in our first week of  service in Canada, so we are hopeful of a Canada-like success in the Nordics.    Nordics members are not in our Q3 results, since the launch was in October.      U.K. and Ireland    As announced in August, we are currently over 1 million members strong in the U.K. and Ireland and  continued to see strong growth in Q3.     The U.K./Ireland market is expensive for content due to the competition with Sky and Amazon  LOVEFiLM.  We are very happy to be ahead of LOVEFiLM, and intend to continue to expand our content  and grow our members rapidly.  As we expected, the U.K./Ireland market will take materially longer  than Canada to get to profitability, given the high level of competition and the continued expansion of  our content.       Latin America    We have over 1 million members in Latin America, and there are over 50 million broadband households  across these growing economies.      Our service is working very well and voluntary churn is low in most of the region.  We are growing  rapidly, and we continue to add more content, especially in Brazil.  Per-member viewing is up  substantially from launch one year ago.  We are outpacing all of our competitors.       The biggest issue holding back much stronger growth is payments.  For a variety of reasons, many Latin  American broadband households are leery of, or unable to, provide debit/credit cards that can be  accepted over the Internet.  For those who do provide us debit/credit cards, we see higher rates of  payment declines than in our other markets.  Since these are households who are successfully paying for      5    home broadband, we should be able to improve our effectiveness.  We are working hard on all avenues  to address these issues and accelerate our growth.  In the long term, as ecommerce further develops in  Latin America, these issues will lessen.     It will take longer than we had planned to get to profitability in Latin America, but we are confident that  this will be a very large and profitable market for us long term.       Canada    Canada continues to be a very strong market for us. Two years have passed since launch, and our  subscriber growth is steady to slightly accelerating.  Both retention and engagement are high among our  Canadian members.    We expanded our profitability in Canada in Q3 as revenue grew more quickly than content expense, and  we intend to steadily expand our contribution margin over time, even as we continue to add more  content.     Total International Results & Outlook    Total international contribution loss of $92 million was slightly higher than the $89 million loss in Q2, as  we decided to capitalize on our strong U.K./Ireland momentum by investing additionally in our content  library to drive more membership growth and more viewing.     In Q4, as we launched the Nordics, we expect international contribution losses to increase to  approximately $113 million (guidance midpoint) as we will have incremental content and marketing  expenses but minimal revenue yet from this market. We intend this to be our peak quarter of  international losses, and expect international losses will decline quarter by quarter next year.  Once  we’ve substantially reduced international losses, and with Netflix then being solidly profitable on a  global basis, we will launch our next round of international expansion.       Our aggressive investments today in international expansion have laid the foundation for building long- term profitable franchises in these markets, just as we have already done in Canada.  Consumers around  the world want Internet TV, and we are providing it for them in each of our markets.               6    Streaming Competition    With big markets comes competition. Since the transition from linear TV to Internet TV provides a  staggeringly large long-term opportunity, it is not surprising that we are seeing more competitors vying  for consumers’ time and money.    One class of competitors are MVPDs and around the world they are getting better, offering on-demand  services through DVRs, and TV Everywhere extensions like Xfinity.com.  The prices charged by cable and  satellite services are generally $50 to $100 per month, and we are a supplemental entertainment choice  in comparison to these competitors.  When we compare our viewing growth in those U.S. markets  served by leading MVPDs offering TV Everywhere, versus the nation as a whole, we don’t see any  difference. The implication is that even the best TV Everywhere isn’t yet an attractive alternative to  Netflix viewing for Netflix members.    Another class of competitors is other low-cost, globally-ambitious Internet subscription services.  The big  four are Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and HBO.  We each have unique strategies to win share of consumers’  time and spending. Three of us are Internet firms with mostly licensed content, all getting into original  content.  One of us (HBO) is an original content firm getting into the Internet subscription business.  It is  possible that several of us of will be successful since some consumers will subscribe to multiple services,  each of which has unique content.       Hulu operates in Japan and the U.S. and is a joint venture owned by News Corp., Disney, and Comcast.    While there are now around 2 million Hulu Plus members in the U.S., the ownership of Hulu makes it a  wild-card in terms of future evolution as a global competitor.   We believe in terms of U.S. viewing, Hulu  is currently our closest U.S. competitor.   Hulu is investing in producing original content.  Hulu has  commercial interruptions in their paid and free service, unlike Netflix, Amazon and HBO.    Amazon is taking different strategies in the U.K. and the U.S.  In the U.K., Amazon bought the LOVEFiLM  DVD rental service early in 2011, presumably as a launch vehicle for streaming.   For most of 2011,  LOVEFiLM streaming was only available bundled with DVD rental and in late 2011, LOVEFiLM started  offering a standalone streaming service.  Netflix and Amazon LOVEFiLM now compete in the U.K. with  similar price points.  In the U.K., Amazon has Prime, but has not chosen to include streaming video as  part of Prime.  Our analysis of viewing and content says we are already modestly ahead in streaming  viewing and content library, which we are very happy about given the large head-start LOVEFiLM had in  the region.  Our content is substantially distinct from LOVEFiLM’s content.  We will keep investing in  better content, and improving our member experience, which benefits from our global focus on  streaming.    In the U.S., Amazon is bundling streaming with its Prime shipping service, instead of with DVD rental.   The majority of our most popular content is unavailable on Amazon Prime Instant Video, per the  discussion above in the Domestic Streaming Content section.  Our members tell us they’d like more      7    content, not less, so we feel good about our relative content offering. Amazon is investing in original  exclusive content as well. Our estimate is that viewing of Amazon Prime Instant Video has yet to pass  that of Hulu.      HBO is planning to launch a direct-to-consumer Internet subscription service in the Nordics, matching  our low price point.  This will be the first test of our relative strengths in stand-alone subscription video- on-demand.  We think it will make strategic sense eventually for HBO to go direct-to-consumer in the  U.S., and become more of a competitor to Netflix; so, that is our operating assumption, and we are  looking forward to competing in the Nordics.    Since many consumers in that eventuality would subscribe to both HBO and Netflix, we would compete  like any two networks today.  Our content is distinct from their content.  Today we think the U.S.  viewing of HBO GO by HBO’s approximately 29 million domestic subscribers has yet to equal overall  viewing of Hulu or Amazon Prime.     Finally, to be more complete in our assessment, we also compete for time with piracy, ad-supported  streaming services, pay-per-view/VOD and linear programming.  In most markets there are now local  competitors, such as Sky’s Now TV in the U.K. and Viasat’s Viaplay in the Nordics.  And there will surely  be more who will try to build a compelling subscription streaming offering against Netflix, Hulu, Amazon  and HBO.    Against each of our competitors we have some mix of better exclusive content, better member  experience, and a clearer brand identity. We are working to expand these advantages to win even more  of those moments of truth when consumers decide on any given evening what service they turn to first  when looking for entertainment.  Despite this increasing competition, our per member viewing  continues to rise.     Original Programming    Our goal is to produce unique and compelling serialized content for a cost comparable to similar  licensed exclusive content, using these original series to strengthen our reputation and build deeper  emotional ties to consumers.  If we are as successful with originals as we think we will be in Q1, then the  attention paid to Netflix will be positive and substantial, and we’ll have more people joining Netflix than  we would otherwise.     Our first streaming content type was movies.  Then we added licensed prior-season television.   This  third category of content is first window premiere of exclusive serialized episodic television.    We are now in full production of four original series to debut exclusively on Netflix in 2013, plus a  second season of “Lilyhammer,” which debuted on Netflix last February.           8    On February 1st, we’ll release in all of our markets the entire first season (13 episodes) of David  Fincher’s “House of Cards” starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright.  The first few episodes are nearly  done and we are delighted with the results.  Typically when one discovers a new show on linear TV they  get the joy of watching a new episode only to have to wait a week or more to see the next one. We are  releasing all the episodes at once because that is the better member experience that comes from  Internet TV.    Later in the spring we will be bringing Netflix members the long-awaited fourth season of “Arrested  Development,” a show that has grown astonishingly in popularity in the six years it has been off-air and  which now has a large global base of fans awaiting season four.  Like our other originals, this will only be  available on Netflix within our markets.     After that comes “Hemlock Grove,” a horror thriller from scare king Eli Roth, starring Famke Janssen,  Dougray Scott and Lili Taylor, then “Orange is the New Black,” a prison dramedy from “Weeds” creator  Jenji Kohan starring Taylor Schilling and Jason Biggs, and lastly, season two of “Lilyhammer”.     If you step back a decade, our first competence as a company was DVD-by-mail.  Next, we figured out  how to succeed in streaming of TV shows and movies.  Then we started expanding internationally, one  market at a time, learning as we grew.   Like our global expansion, we will take our original programming  expansion step by step, getting better along the way.       Embarking on original series has implications from a cash flow standpoint.  Our cash expense for  originals is quite front loaded, compared to the P&L expense on these deals.  We’ll often pay for the  entire 5-10 year license all in the first few years.  Q4 of this year will be the first quarter in which our  originals start to become a material use of cash relative to the P&L.  More on this topic below in the FCF  section.   Improving Streaming Member Experience    Our better member experience is key to staying ahead of the competition, and increasing consumer  engagement. When most companies grow, they see their engagement metrics drop, while we see the  opposite, with hours viewed per member continuing to climb despite our already large scale. Crucial to  driving hours viewed are the efforts of our product teams, who during the quarter launched several  improvements to the Netflix experience.    A key thing that sets Netflix apart is our algorithms for personalization, which help members find  content they will enjoy, and lead to increased viewing for any given set of content.  Compared to  simplistic “most popular” merchandising, our algorithms add much enjoyment to our members’  experience.  We continue to A/B test new algorithms, and our rate of learning is faster than any  competitor because we have a larger membership from which to learn.          9    On the visual side, this quarter we launched a new and improved UI for smart phones (both iPhone and  Android), which allows for richer content browsing on devices. In addition, we launched our first multi- device experience: smartphones (both Android and iPhones) can now be used to control the Netflix TV  experience via the PS3.  As this interaction model becomes more common among our members, we’ll  improve the experience to match the need, adding more functionality and expanding the device reach.     To increase consumer engagement, we launched an improved post-play experience on the website and  the PS3 (with other devices to follow soon), which makes it even easier to play subsequent episodes and  offer relevant suggestions at the end of movies.    As a sign of our achievements in the area of product development and the technical advancement of  television, we were delighted to receive this month our first Emmy from the Academy of Television Arts  and Sciences for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development.  DVD    DVD subscriptions declined this quarter to 8.6 million, at the better end of our guidance range. Over  two-thirds of these DVD members also subscribe to our streaming service.  We expect DVD subscriptions  to continue their decline but we’re pleased the decline slowed in Q3.  DVD is a great reference format,  and we carry nearly every DVD ever published.  We continue to see minimal service-related impacts  from the first round of USPS processing center reductions that took effect in the first week of July.     The domestic DVD segment delivered $131 million of contribution profit in Q3, representing a 48%  contribution margin, higher than the 46% margin in Q1 and Q2 due to a lower rev share mix this quarter.   We anticipate contribution margin will be up slightly in Q4, and then down sequentially from Q4 to Q1  as usage increases in Q1 and the expected USPS rate increases take effect in January.      Global Profitability:  Q3 Results & Q4 Outlook     We remained profitable this quarter with $8 million of net income, and $0.13 EPS. Compared to Q2, net  income was essentially flat, as increased domestic streaming contribution profit (up $8 million) more  than offset a $3 million decline of DVD contribution profit, a $3 million increase in international losses,  and a $2 million increase in global operating expenses.       Our combined U.S. business remains strong. Excluding international contribution losses, we will  generate over $400 million of operating income this year after covering global operating expenses.  As  expected, in Q4, we will likely move to a consolidated loss because of our initial launch investment in  the Nordics.         10    Free Cash Flow & Content Commitments    In Q3, as expected, negative free cash flow of $20 million trailed net income of $8 million, and we ended  the quarter with $798 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Significant uses of  cash in the quarter (relative to net income) were cash payments for content (in excess of the P&L  expense), cash payments for PP&E (including cache boxes for our Open Connect program), and  reductions in miscellaneous accounts payable and accrued expenses.    As we’ve highlighted, our movement into original programming will require more up-front cash  payments than our typical content licensing agreements, beginning in Q4 and increasing in 2013. So, due  to initial cash payments for originals, in addition to other cash payments for content in excess of P&L  expense, we anticipate negative FCF for several quarters.  We have enough cash on hand to fund our  planned originals in addition to our ongoing expenses, maintain an adequate reserve, and then return to  positive FCF.  We believe the investment in originals is wise, and we will evaluate the performance of  the slate next year to determine at what level we should fund additional originals.      We have invested heavily over the past two years in building our global content library, and as a result,  the corresponding contractual obligations have ramped significantly. While we are still adding new  shows and movies to the service every quarter, and our engagement is growing, our content obligations  have stabilized. In particular, our total streaming commitments at the end of Q3 were flat sequentially at  $5.0 billion, with $2.1 billion due within the next 12 months. Of note, our content licenses and  corresponding obligations are our major cost of revenues. And, as we point out each time we reference  obligations, the $5.0 billion represents the known minimum obligation amounts, but does not include  obligations that we cannot quantify but could be significant.           11       Business Outlook        Summary    We believe Internet TV will grow for the next few decades, and that some firms will build extremely  valuable businesses providing consumers an incredible, personalized Internet TV experience.     Society has had over 50 years of linear TV dominance where channel owners decide what and when  people can enjoy content.  With Internet TV, consumers get power, control and convenience. They can  decide what, when, and where they want to watch. They can pause and resume anytime.  They can  enjoy content on a broad range of amazing devices.     Internet TV is the future of television, and we are leading the change.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and  net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with  GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements     This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding contribution margin; growth of broadband penetration;  improvements to our service; size of domestic streaming opportunity; continued improvement in  content offerings; growth and business outlook in our international markets; international contribution  losses and launch timing of additional international market; competition; release timing of original  programming; DVD member losses and contribution margin; free cash flow and usage of cash; member  growth, including total and paid; revenue, and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming  and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the fourth  quarter of 2012. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; the continued availability of  content on terms and conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for  instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website  and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition and  widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on February 10, 2012. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements  to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release.                                                                                                                                                                        14 Netflix, Inc.

October and November member trends were consistent with our expectations from our last earnings  call, while in December, we not only returned to strongly positive net streaming additions (aided by  strong seasonal gross adds) but exceeded our forecast.  In particular, we saw fewer streaming  cancellations, as well as lower migration to DVD-only plans, resulting in the outperformance for  streaming members.    The domestic streaming segment delivered $52 million of contribution profit, or 10.9% contribution  margin. We exceeded our domestic streaming contribution margin target of around 8% due to higher  than expected streaming members and revenue, as well as some under-spending in both content and  marketing.    Outlook   We are encouraged by the strength in acquisition that we are seeing, coupled with continued  improvements in retention among our domestic streaming members. For Q1 to date, our domestic net  additions for streaming are tracking close to our net additions in Q1 2010 of 1.7 million net additions.   Given this trend, we are comfortable with our ability to continue to expand our domestic streaming  contribution margin.   Since we significantly out-performed our 8% domestic streaming contribution margin target in Q4, we  are increasing our Q1 contribution margin target to approximately 11%. Then, consistent with our  previous guidance, we expect to increase the domestic streaming contribution margin throughout the  year to deliver a trend of margin expansion that averages 100 bps per quarter.  We will continue to  increase our content spending sequentially every quarter, but not at the year-over-year rate expected in  Q1 (more than doubling).    Domestic Content Library  As a result of the significant investments in our streaming library throughout 2011, our current domestic  offering is dramatically improved from a year ago. We have a material increase in the quantity and  quality of the content to show for our increased spending – most notably across on-air TV, kids TV and  library TV. While our 2012 domestic streaming content commitments are already substantially in place,  that doesn’t mean our offering will be static in the coming months. The relationships we’ve established  with all major producers of film and TV in the U.S., including multiple output arrangements, ensure a  steady flow of new titles to the service.  The remaining Starz titles will come off our domestic service at the end of February.  Since the Sony  output came off in Q2 2011, the remaining Starz content is primarily the Encore catalog titles and the 15  current Disney Pay 1 titles.  For the Encore catalog titles, we have plenty of substitutes and in many      3  cases have already directly relicensed from the studios some of the top performing Encore titles. So, the  only significant loss is the current 15 Disney output titles, such as “Toy Story 3” and “Tangled,” which  currently constitute about 2% of our domestic viewing.      Throughout 2012, Paramount will provide us (through our EPIX deal) with such successful family fare as  “The Adventures of Tin Tin,” “Rango” and “Hugo,” which, with 11 Oscar nominations including Best  Picture, is one of the most acclaimed movies of the year.  And in 2013, when our DreamWorks  Animation output deal comes online, we’ll strengthen our long-term, stable flow of great animated  family film titles.    More generally, the Pay 1 titles from our other output deals will increase in the coming months as EPIX,  Relativity, Film District, Open Road and others provide Netflix with films that have already tallied more  than $1.3 billion in domestic box office, including “Thor,” “Transformers 3,” “Captain America,” “Super  8,” “The Immortals” and “Footloose.”  Last quarter, we explained that the evolution of video streaming services to a large extent reflects the  legacy of television networks: namely, historical reliance upon exclusive content as a differentiator.  Consistent with this practice, we are increasingly licensing content on an exclusive basis.     Domestic Streaming Competition  We compete for viewing time with a very wide range of providers.  As other viewing solutions for TV  shows and movies get better, we will face increased competition and potential decreased viewing share.  On the other hand, if our service improves faster than others, we will increase our viewing share.   One class of competitors is the other over-the-top pure plays such as Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime.   We  expect Amazon to continue to offer their video service as a free extra with Prime domestically but also  to brand their video subscription offering as a standalone service at a price less than ours.  Both Amazon  and Hulu Plus’s content is a fraction of our content, and we believe their respective total viewing hours  are each less than 10% of ours.   In the case of Hulu Plus, subscribers have to pay for the service ($7.99)  and still watch commercials (unlike, commercial-free Netflix).  Even if Hulu could afford our level of  content spend, at the same price consumers would prefer commercial-free Netflix over commercial- interrupted Hulu Plus.    As we’ve often said, we see the biggest long term threat as TV Everywhere, and in particular, HBO GO,  the leading implementation of TV Everywhere to date.   HBO has some great content, particularly their  original series, but today for most people it is locked behind a linear interface, or at best, behind a DVR  interface and in all cases tethered to a linear subscription plan.   As HBO GO grows and becomes the  primary way that consumers experience HBO, it will become a much more effective competitor for  viewing time.  Similarly, Showtime’s TV Everywhere application is very impressive and just starting to  gain traction.  Every major network is investing in their Internet application, on tablets, smart TVs,  phones, game consoles, and laptops.  Pricing is simple: the consumer just authenticates with their MVPD  provider.   Over the next few years, UIs will evolve in astounding ways, such as allowing viewers to      4  watch eight simultaneous games on ESPN, color coding where the best action is in a given moment or  allowing Olympics fans the ability to control their own slow-motion replays.  A decade from now,  choosing a linear feed from a broadcast grid of 200 channels will seem like using a rotary dial telephone.  Just as broadcast networks have substantially transformed themselves into cable channels over the last  twenty years, both broadcast and cable networks will effectively also become Internet networks like  Netflix.   As a pure-play we have many advantages, however, just as cable did over broadcast.   We are  100% on-demand and highly-personalized.  Our brand is broad, rather than niche, so we can combine  the benefits of multiple channels into one service.   Additionally, our Internet culture enables us to  create and drive social TV, recommendations TV, and other Internet innovations faster than our cable  and broadcast network competitors.     As cable networks developed, they were able to both compete with broadcast networks, and to bolster  broadcast networks economics through syndication.   Today it is accepted practice for networks to  license parts of their content to other networks, if they get paid well enough.   That is the world of  content licensing in which we live.   In that sense, we are just another network competing for viewing  time with, and licensing content from, other networks.   VPPA Update  In 46 of the 47 countries we serve, members can currently enjoy automatic seamless video sharing  between friends on Facebook, in the same manner that they can choose to enjoy automatic seamless  sharing between friends of their music listening and news story viewing.    As we’ve highlighted before, under a U.S. law enacted in the 1980s, companies that rent or sell physical  video tapes or DVDs are subject to particular privacy rules.   This law, the Video Privacy Protection Act,  or VPPA, creates confusion over our ability to allow U.S. members to choose to automatically share their  viewing history with their friends.   A broad bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House recognized  the benefits of modernizing and simplifying this law and passed H.R. 2471, an amendment to the VPPA  that clarifies the ability of consumers to elect to share their viewing history on an ongoing basis if they  so wish.   Now this proposed amendment is with the Senate, and they have scheduled a hearing on the  VPPA for next week.    International Streaming  In our 5th quarter since launching international operations, we reached 1.9 million international  streaming members in Q4.   Canada  In Canada in Q4, we enhanced our offering with fresh movies and TV shows from existing output deals,  as well as new deals. For TV, we’ve significantly improved our television catalog with new content from  FOX, Sony, and AMC and for film, we have continued to add Pay 1 film titles such as “Black Swan,” “True  Grit,” “The Chronicles of Narnia” and “Rango,” as well as great catalog titles like “Pulp Fiction.” The      5  addition of lots of compelling new shows and movies both drove increased hours viewed per member  and member acquisition during the quarter.   The market opportunity in Canada is exciting enough that we continue to invest in the content library,  meaning that we’ll run at roughly break even for two quarters, and we expect to return to a positive  contribution profit starting in Q3 of this year, two years after our initial launch.  Our plan after that is to  grow our contribution margin as we continue to grow our membership.     Latin America  In Latin America, we ended the year with about the same number of members as we had in Canada at  the same time post-launch last year.  Latin America has about 4x more broadband households than  Canada; so, our focus is on capturing a larger portion of the market opportunity.  Latin America presents unique challenges relative to our other markets; namely, low device penetration,  high piracy, varying preferences for subtitles, and relatively low credit card usage for ecommerce. We  are quickly learning what content works best in the region, and are adjusting our content library  accordingly. We have already nearly doubled our content library since launch, adding considerably more  U.S. and local movies and TV.  We are rapidly increasing the accessibility of our service by adding more  subtitles in both Spanish and Portuguese (in addition to dubs), as well as expanding the range of Netflix  enabled devices in the region. Finally, as expected upon launch, we’ve found that processing  ecommerce consumer payments is quite challenging as compared with North America and Europe. To  overcome this challenge, we are working with our local payment partners to optimize our systems,  exploring adding new payment methods and testing various trial campaigns to improve conversion.   We are committed to the region over the long-term, encouraged by the prospect of building a large,  profitable business over time, just as DIRECTV has done.   UK and Ireland  Our UK and Ireland launch at the beginning of the month was very successful, and we’re seeing faster  member growth than we did when we launched Canada.   As our membership in the UK and Ireland  grows, we’ll be able to invest more and more in content.  We have a great selection of new films from  Lionsgate and others, and will have on our service such highly-anticipated films as “Hunger Games” and  “The Hobbit”, in addition to catalog movies from 5 of the 6 major studios.  On the TV side, we have  current Hollywood TV from the major networks and three key local channels.    In the UK and Ireland we launched with our best Facebook implementation to date.  The positive social  effects get stronger as the number of connected members rises, so we are working hard on making  connecting very easy, and the connected experience very enjoyable.  Just as in the U.S. where our primary long-term competition will likely be TV Everywhere, in the UK our  long-term competition will likely be Sky Go offering Sky Movies and Sky Atlantic on-demand.  (Sky  Atlantic is mostly HBO Originals content, and Sky Movies is one channel with the Pay 1 movie output  from all six major U.S. movie studios).  We believe we will compete very effectively against Sky Go, given      6  our advantages of being an unbundled low-priced offering with broad content that is purely on-demand,  and personalized. Over the coming years, we hope to be able to grow large enough to outbid Sky for one  or more major studio output deals, as we did this year for MGM.    Finally, in the UK, but not in Ireland, we also have the “free” BBC iPlayer and Amazon’s LOVEFiLM as  competitors for viewing time.  LOVEFiLM is primarily a DVD-by-mail service with 2 million DVD  subscribers in the UK, Germany and the Nordics.  iPlayer is an excellent over-the-top last few days catch- up service, free for UK residents.   Total International Results & Outlook    In Q4, international revenue of $29 million was in-line with expectations, while contribution loss of $60  million was slightly better due to lower content expenses.  In Q1, the combined investments in both Latin America and the UK and Ireland will result in a total  international contribution loss of between $108 and $118 million. In future quarters, we intend to  continue to increase our investment in the content libraries in each market, just as we have done in  Canada since launch. Doing so improves the consumer experience, builds strong word of mouth and  positive brand awareness, and drives additional acquisition, all elements of a strong foundation for long- term success. As we improve the service, we grow membership and thus we expect the quarterly  international losses to moderate slightly.   DVD  Q4 Results  As expected, DVD members declined this quarter to 11.2 million due to the continued impact of the  price changes, as hybrid members continued to predominantly choose a streaming-only plan over a  higher priced hybrid plan.  Both hybrid cancellation and migration to streaming-only plans ebbed  through the quarter. We added over 600k unique domestic members in Q4, ending the quarter with  24.4 million.   The domestic DVD segment delivered $194 million of contribution profit in Q4, representing a 52.4%  contribution margin.  The slight out-performance relative to our guidance was predominantly  attributable to a higher ASP than forecasted due to more DVD members staying on 2+ disc plans.    Outlook  While DVD members declined sharply over the last two quarters, the weekly rate of DVD cancellations  has subsided from peak levels in September. Looking out across 2012, we expect continued attrition  among our DVD members. Specifically, in Q1, we expect net losses of DVD members of approximately  1.5 million, with the sequential decline moderating in future quarters.   The DVD business model is predominantly variable cost based. So, as the size of the market opportunity  continues to decline, we expect healthy contribution profit margins to be maintained. Meanwhile, for      7  customers with DVD needs (namely, completeness, simplicity, and with limited broadband), our product  is priced 20% lower than our nearest competitor, and our service remains better and faster.  Earlier this month, Warner Home Entertainment announced it was moving the availability date for rental  DVDs to kiosk and all subscription by mail services to 56 days post the release date for retail sale. This  followed its move to impose a 28 day delay on store based rentals. While we didn’t like the new release  date schemes, we decided that it was better for our members for us to maintain a direct relationship  with Warner under the selling terms it has imposed. The alternative was to secure discs through  multiple retail and third party channels, which can be unreliable and may have added to the time it  takes to procure enough DVDs to meet member demand. We suspect there will be increasingly  differentiated dates as the studios re-configure their shrinking packaged goods businesses.  Product Improvement  Constantly improving our service is key to satisfying current members and attracting new ones. The  better we make the Netflix experience, the more hours are watched, translating into increased retention  and strong word of mouth referral.  In Q4, we announced several product enhancements to that end.    We improved the Netflix experience on the Xbox 360, launching a user interface (UI) that is compatible  with Kinect, allowing members to navigate the Netflix UI with voice and gesture.  The new Xbox app  makes substantial improvements in the streaming experience, reducing the amount of re-buffering,  accelerating start-up, and delivering higher quality streams. We introduced a new UI for the iPad,  making it easier and quicker for members to find what to watch, and we expanded our presence on  tablets as a launch partner of both Amazon’s Kindle Fire and the Barnes & Noble NOOK Tablet.     Following our well-received launch of the “Just for Kids” feature in July, we rolled out the feature to the  Nintendo Wii. Additionally, we made updates to the Netflix app for Android which improved the user  experience and increased the breadth of Android devices supported.  Finally, we had several  personalization algorithm breakthroughs for how we sort titles in each category, making it easier for our  members to find movies and TV shows they’ll love.      Original Programming    Our first Netflix original series, \"Lilyhammer,\" a fish-out-of-water story set in Norway and starring \"The  Sopranos\" mainstay and E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt, will debut on our service on February  6th in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.  All eight first season episodes of \"Lilyhammer\" will be  available at once, so Netflix members can enjoy the first season as quickly as they like, instead of having  to wait a week for each new episode as they would with linear programming.    More Netflix original series are planned for 2012 and 2013, including House of Cards (Q4 2012), and an  exclusive and original fourth season of Arrested Development (2013). Our spending on original  programming is intended to allow us to test a new licensing model using a small portion of our content      8  budget. If “Lilyhammer” or “House of Cards” is popular enough on Netflix so that the fees we’ve paid for  each are in-line with that of other equally-popular content on Netflix during the same time period, we’ll  consider them a success.   Global Profitability: Q4 Results & Outlook  Q4 net income of $41 million, and $0.73 per share, exceeded our expectations, predominantly driven by  the out-performance of domestic streaming contribution profit discussed above.  In general, member growth or contraction in a quarter effects revenue the following quarter more than  the quarter of the change.   The sharp decline in DVD members in Q4 means that in Q1 our DVD revenue  will decline by about as much as our streaming revenue will increase, resulting in approximately flat  sequential revenue in Q1.     Due to the increased investment in international, in particular the launch of the UK, our current outlook  is for a consolidated loss of between $9 and $27 million in Q1. While contribution profit from domestic  streaming will grow sequentially, it will not be sufficient to offset the sequential decline in DVD profits  (~$50 million), and the sequential increase in our international losses (~$50 million), as well as cover our  global G&A and Technology & Development costs.   As a result, we expect modest quarterly losses, as well as losses for the calendar year. Until we achieve  our goal of returning to global profitability, we do not intend to launch additional international markets.    Q4 Free Cash Flow   In Q4, FCF of $34 million slightly trailed net income of $41 million. Significant sources of cash flow in the  quarter (relative to net income) were non-cash stock compensation and an increase in accounts payable  related to timing of marketing payments. These sources of cash were more than offset by cash  payments for content (in excess of the P&L expense), a decline in deferred revenue and an interest  payment on our notes.   In the quarter, we continued to add to our domestic and international content libraries. For the full year  2011, we added $2.3 billion of streaming content library assets (or, $1.6 billion net of amortization  expense) to our balance sheet. Since we have been generally successful in matching payment terms with  the expense, the growth in streaming content assets also coincided with an increase in our content  related liabilities of $1.5 billion, representing payment obligations under our content licenses not yet  due.    As we add original content in the last quarter of this year, we expect payments for originals to weigh on  FCF as they typically require more up-front payments than non-original content license payment terms.       9    Q4 Financing  Our standard practice with regard to managing our capital structure has been to evaluate on an on- going basis the appropriate cash level and capital structure for the business. In Q4, given the pain from  our price changes and the impact to our 2012 outlook, this analysis led us to the decision to strengthen  our balance sheet by raising $400 million of additional capital from two long-term oriented  shareholders. $200 million was raised through the sale of equity (2.86 million shares at $70 per share),  and $200 million was raised through the private placement of zero-coupon convertible notes.  We have  no intentions to spend this additional capital; it is merely a stronger safety-net for an aggressive, fast  moving business with a big opportunity.    After the financing, we finished the quarter with $798 million in cash and equivalents.   Metrics evolution  As stated in our January 2011 investor letter, net additions, along with revenue and contribution profit,  are our core performance measurements for each of our segments.  This is the final letter in which we  will provide gross additions, churn and SAC in our domestic results, conforming to how we have been  reporting our international streaming results.  Starting this quarter, we will be also providing guidance for paid members, in addition to our traditional  guidance for total members. Since paid membership drives revenue and profit, we believe a focus on  this metric is most relevant for our financial discussions. We will continue to report free, paid, and total  subscribers by segment.      As we evolve our focus from DVD to streaming, we are slightly updating our definition of membership  starting with this quarter’s membership guidance. Members who are on payment hold will no longer be  counted as members, while members who cancel mid-period will be counted until their service ceases at  the end of the period. We estimate the net effect of these changes will be less than 200k fewer  domestic streaming members than we would otherwise report in Q1. There is no effect on revenue from  this change.      10    CEO Stock Sales  Reed has some 10-year options expiring in Q1, and will be making a one-time sale of those shares as  part of a 10b5-1 plan, but is otherwise not selling stock this quarter.    CMO Search  As we announced last week, we’re looking for a CMO who today probably runs marketing at a cable  network or a mobile phone network, and has strong global experience.  Typically these searches take 4-6  months.  In the meantime, our long time executive Jessie Becker is our Interim CMO, and is a candidate  for the role also.   Leslie Kilgore made huge contributions over the last 12 years to nearly every part of  our business, and we’re very happy to have her join our Board of Directors to continue to help Netflix  prosper.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities.  However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income,  operating income and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in  tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements     This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding our long-term opportunities and improvements to our  service; growth trends, including subscriber acquisition,  contribution profit and margin as well as  content acquisition; international segment performance, including Canadian contribution profit and  Latin America challenges as well as content investment;  DVD subscriber losses and contribution profit;  global profitability; content acquisition, including original programming and specific title availability;  competition; free cash flow and usage of cash; our subscriber growth, including total and paid;  revenue,  and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations as  well as net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of 2012. The forward-looking statements  in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ,  including, without limitation: our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers; our  ability to compete effectively; our ability to build back our brand; the continued availability of content  on terms and conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant  streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website or with  third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition and widespread consumer  adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these  and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from  such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on  February 18, 2011.

       " 'Investor-Letter-Q42012-01': \"1      January 23rd, 2013            Dear Fellow Shareholders,    Q4 capped a tremendous year for Netflix as Internet TV becomes an ever-growing part of people’s lives:     we added nearly 10 million global streaming members in 2012,   we grew to over 33 million global streaming members,   we generated profits for the year 2012, despite large international investments establishing  Netflix in 40 countries around the world, and   we developed several major original series, which debut this year.     Our summary results for Q4 2012 follow:    (in millions except per share data)  Q4 '11  Q1 '12  Q2 '12  Q3 '12  Q4 '12  Domestic Streaming:            Net Subscription Additions  0.22   1.74   0.53   1.16   2.05   Total Subscriptions  21.67   23.41   23.94   25.10   27.15   Paid Subscriptions  20.15   22.02   22.69   23.80   25.47   Revenue  $  476  $  507  $  533  $  556  $  589   Contribution Profit  $  52  $  67  $  83  $  91  $  109   Contribution Margin  10.9 %  13.2 %  15.6 %  16.4 %  18.5 %              International Streaming:            Net Subscription Additions  0.38   1.21   0.56   0.69   1.81   Total Subscriptions  1.86   3.07   3.62   4.31   6.12   Paid Subscriptions  1.45   2.41   3.02   3.69   4.89   Revenue  $  29  $  43  $  65  $  78  $  101   Contribution Profit (Loss)  $  (60 ) $  (103 ) $  (89 ) $  (92 ) $  (105 )              Domestic DVD:            Net Subscription Additions  (2.76 )  (1.08 )  (0.85 )  (0.63 )  (0.38 )  Total Subscriptions  11.17   10.09   9.24   8.61   8.22   Paid Subscriptions  11.04   9.96   9.15   8.47   8.05   Revenue  $  370  $  320  $  291  $  271  $  254   Contribution Profit  $  194  $  146  $  134  $  131  $  128   Contribution Margin  52.4 %  45.6 %  46.0 %  48.2 %  50.1 %              Global:            Revenue  $  876  $  870  $  889  $  905  $  945   Net Income (Loss)  $  35  $  (5 ) $  6  $  8  $  8   EPS  $  0.64  $  (0.08 ) $  0.11  $  0.13  $  0.13               Free Cash Flow  $  34  $  2  $  11  $  (20 ) $  (51 )  Shares (FD)  55.4   55.5   58.8   58.7   59.1                            2      Domestic Streaming    We added more than 2 million members in Q4 to end the year with over 27 million domestic members.   Our holiday season was particularly strong, driven by consumers buying new electronic devices,  including tablets and smart TVs.       Both voluntary and involuntary retention improved in Q4.  The increase in involuntary retention was due  to improvements in how we process payments and recover those members on payment hold.  We  believe the gains in voluntary retention stemmed from steady improvements in service and content  relative to the broad array of video choices available to consumers, as shown by the continued growth  in our median hours viewed per member.     Contribution margin continued to climb in Q4, expanding sequentially 210 basis points to 18.5%.   Our  outperformance relative to our target of 100 basis points of margin expansion per quarter was driven by  higher than forecasted members and revenue and lower than forecasted content delivery costs.      Starting this quarter, you’ll see that we expanded our segment disclosures to break out marketing and  cost of revenues.  We’ve been investing in making our service better with increased spending on  content, which helps both retain and attract members, and have been able to trim marketing spending  yet maintain strong net additions.     Our target remains to expand contribution margin on average about 100 basis points per quarter.  We  anticipate domestic streaming contribution profit will, for the first time ever, be larger than DVD  contribution profit (and up about 90% year over year) in Q1.    Regarding domestic streaming content, we announced in Q4 that we will be the exclusive “Pay 1” home  for theatrical releases from the Walt Disney Studio starting in 2016.  While we’ve done similar major  studio Pay 1 deals before (e.g. Paramount in Canada, Warner Bros. in the Nordics, and Lionsgate in the  U.K. and Ireland), and will do more in the future, the Disney deal is particularly significant because it is  our first Pay 1 deal with a major studio in the U.S. and because of the strength of the Disney, Pixar,  Marvel and Lucasfilm titles.  2016 is a long way off, and in the meantime, we are adding lots of other  great films and TV shows, including a wide assortment of family films from the Disney catalog.    More recently, we signed a deal with Warner Bros., the largest TV producer in the world, bringing  exclusively to Netflix complete previous seasons of popular on-air serialized dramas such as  “Revolution” on NBC and “The Following” on Fox. This deal is significant because we are licensing  directly from the producer, rather than the networks on which these shows air, allowing us to bring  previous seasons to Netflix earlier than traditional network deals have accommodated. This type of  license agreement plays right to our sweet spot.  When it comes to highly serialized TV series, Netflix                         3      offers an amazingly better experience than any other alternative as members can start right from  season one, episode one and watch episodes how and when they feel like it.     In terms of domestic competition, TV Everywhere, including HBO GO, continues to improve, and linear  TV distributors clearly see the benefit of offering Internet TV.  This competition for viewing time will  increase over the next several years, as we have long predicted, as consumers come to expect Internet  TV on demand viewing for all their video entertainment.    More narrowly, Amazon Prime, Redbox Instant, and Hulu also offer low-cost streaming offerings, and  they have some of the same content that Netflix has, as well as some unique content.   The more unique  content they have (for example, “Battleground” and “Community” on Hulu, or “Falling Skies” and “The  Closer” on Amazon Prime), the more they are a different service than ours.  To the degree they have  some of the same content as Netflix, they are potentially a substitute for Netflix.  To examine this, we  looked at the top 200 titles on Netflix:  our 100 most popular movies and our 100 most popular TV  shows in Q4.  Of these 200, 113 are not on Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus or Redbox Instant. Of the 87 that  are available on at least one of these services, Hulu Plus offers 27 of the 200; Amazon Prime 73 of the  200; and Redbox Instant 12 of the 200, with significant overlap in TV between Hulu Plus and Amazon  Prime, and in movies between Amazon Prime and Redbox Instant.  In other words, when it comes to the  most popular content with members on Netflix, none of these services are good substitutes to Netflix.                                  4      Like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu are moving towards increasing exclusives and original series, and  over time as a group we are likely to compete more like Showtime and HBO do today.  In the U.K. this is  already the case: Sky NOW TV, LOVEFiLM, and Netflix have very limited overlapping content.  The same  holds true in the Nordics among the various services.  In such a world, our originals will be a great asset.      When it comes to competition, we not only have a superior content offering due to our larger budget,  but we are further along the experience curve when it comes to improving our user interface and  delivering great quality streaming. For all of these reasons, Netflix continues to add members rapidly.    Earlier this year, the Video Privacy Protection Act, or VPPA, was modernized and now allows U.S.  members to share what they are watching on Netflix with their friends on an ongoing basis.  Our  members will now be able to choose to have “friends rows” within the Netflix user interface for friends  they have agreed to share viewing with.  Our default settings will not auto-post to Facebook timeline,  but members will be able to post to Facebook specific titles they are passionate about.  We are excited  to roll these features out in the U.S. in the next few months.           Looking forward, we expect this year’s Q1 net additions to be slightly higher than last year’s Q1 net  additions of 1.7 million.  The fact that our growth remains this strong despite intensifying competition,  and our already substantial U.S. market penetration, underlines the large opportunity ahead.     As a reminder, we detailed  in our April 2012 Investor Letter how unchanged seasonality of gross adds  would, due to the larger size of our existing subscriber base, result in increased seasonality of net  additions.  Thus we would expect fewer net additions in Q2 2013 than in Q2 2012, because Q2 is our  seasonally lightest quarter.  That said, we anticipate the fourth season of “Arrested Development” to  debut in Q2, and that could bring us higher than otherwise expected membership.    International    During the quarter, we grew to over 6 million international members, as people around the world  discover the benefits of Netflix.     Our total international contribution loss of $105 million in Q4 was, as expected, higher than the prior  quarter international loss of $92 million, owing to the incremental costs associated with our launch in  the Nordic countries. The Q4 loss was lower, however, than our guidance midpoint of a $113 million  loss, due primarily to the higher than expected growth of international subscriptions and revenue.    Over the course of this year, we expect to see declining losses in our current international markets as  member growth exceeds growth in content spending.  With a Q1 guidance midpoint of $87 million in  international losses, we expect a sequential improvement of $18 million, with more modest sequential  improvements expected in subsequent quarters.                          5      For the first half of 2013, we aren’t planning to launch additional international markets. We are  evaluating several expansion markets for late 2013 or 2014, but have not made any decisions yet. Our  launch in the Nordics was very successful, confirming our belief in the large international opportunity for  our service.    In Latin America, we’ve made steady progress on our consumer payment infrastructure.  In Brazil, we’ve  recently launched a direct debit consumer payment option with several major banks (“Débito  Automático”) and are testing the uniquely Brazilian form of payments known as Boleto Bancário. In  Mexico, we’ve made progress in enabling debit cards for Netflix which has to be done in some cases  bank-by-bank. Over 50 million households pay for residential broadband in Latin America, over half the  U.S. number, so this region is a massive opportunity for us.    In Q4, the 2012 hit film “The Hunger Games” debuted on our Canadian service, with much success, just  as it had a few months prior on our Latin America service.  In Q1, it will debut on our U.K. and Ireland  services, followed by the U.S. The multi-territorial success of “The Hunger Games” on Netflix shows the  value that an international programming platform like Netflix offers content brands, and underlines how  such broad international reach remains unique.    In addition to competition from local broadcasters and distributors with TV Everywhere-type products,  and from piracy, we face many pure-play competitors around the world, including Clarovideo, Sky NOW  TV, HBO Nordics, Amazon LOVEFiLM, Viaplay, and others.  Our estimates from Internet data flows and  other sources suggest we lead all of them in both viewing and revenue. We have a large and growing  membership base to invest against, and our R&D effort is more substantial than our competitors,  allowing us to provide a better and faster-evolving user experience that gives members the ability to  find great series and films to watch, no matter the territory.    Given this heightened competition, we’ll say a little less about country by country results than in the  past, to avoid inadvertently helping our competitors.  Long-term international success for Netflix is  consumer adoption and contribution margins at the levels of our domestic market.  Progress towards  that can be seen quarterly in our growing international membership and declining international losses.    Original Series    We believe that February 1st will be a defining moment in the development of Internet TV.     On that day, we will release all 13 episodes of “House of Cards” in all of our markets, allowing our  members the freedom to immerse themselves when and how they want in the world created by David  Fincher and his stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright.                           6      Imagine if books were always released one chapter per week, and were only briefly available to read at  8pm on Thursday.  And then someone flipped a switch, suddenly allowing people to enjoy an entire  book, all at their own pace. That is the change we are bringing about. That is the future of television.   That is Internet TV.     Stepping back, we have three major types of streaming content on Netflix:  1. Movies from one to fifty years old  2. Prior seasons of current TV shows and complete prior season of off-air TV shows  3. Original series only available on Netflix.     The first category, movies, is where we started.  Then, over the last few years, we’ve greatly expanded  our offering in the second category, prior-season TV, with a particular emphasis on serialized drama.  Such shows were struggling to find a consistent economic return on linear TV, whereas for us they work  great, playing directly into the way that people actually prefer to watch such shows.     Original series are a third type of content to attract and retain members.  Because original series can be  completely exclusive to Netflix (no TVOD, no linear, no kiosks, no theaters) we believe they will be more  effective in attracting and retaining members than equivalent content that is less exclusive to Netflix.       We believe original series developed for Internet TV will be better for creators, better for consumers,  and better for Netflix.  A large on-demand service has fundamental advantages in producing and  launching new series.     Linear channels must aggregate a large audience at a given time of day and hope the show programmed  will actually attract enough viewers despite this constraint.  With Netflix, members can enjoy a show  anytime, and over time, we can effectively put the right show in front of members based on their  viewing habits.  Thus we can spend less on marketing while generating higher viewership.     For linear TV, the fixed number of prime-time slots mean that only shows that hit it big and fast survive,  thus requiring an extensive and expensive pilot system to keep on deck potential replacement shows. In  contrast, Internet TV is an environment where smaller or quirkier shows can prosper because they can  find a big enough audience over time. In baseball terms, linear TV only scores with home runs.  We score  with home runs too, but also with singles, doubles and triples.      Because of our unique strengths, we can commit to producing and publishing “books” rather than  “chapters”, so the creators can concentrate on multi-episode story arcs, rather than pilots.  Creators can  work on episode 11 confident that viewers have recently enjoyed episodes 1 to 10.   Creators can  develop episodes that are not all exactly 22 or 44 minutes in length.  The constraints of the linear TV grid  will fall, one by one.                            7      For viewers, Internet TV is a better experience because of the freedom and flexibility it provides, and in  the case of Netflix, the lack of commercials.  In addition, by releasing our shows on the same day across  all of our markets, we will delight international members, as usually, they have to wait months after a  U.S. premiere to enjoy the same content.      “House of Cards” will be followed by Eli Roth’s “Hemlock Grove” (a horror thriller) on April 19th, the  much anticipated fourth season of “Arrested Development” in May, “Orange is the New Black” (a prison  dramedy from “Weeds” creator Jenji Kohan), “Derek” with Ricky Gervais, and lastly this year, season two  of “Lilyhammer.”    If we are successful with our originals, we will produce content with comparable cost per viewing hour  to other exclusive premium content. Success with originals will also enhance the global reputation of  Netflix as a source of unique must-view content.          While our first slate of originals will represent a small percentage of both our content budget (i.e. P&L  expense) and total viewing hours this year, the cash is front loaded relative to the P&L expense.  In Q4,  our current originals became a material use of cash for the first time.  They are expected to consume  more cash in Q1 and then decrease in terms of cash use in Q2 forward.  More on this topic below in the  FCF section.  Programming Great Content    Our content budget has grown rapidly over the last few years, allowing us to greatly expand the scope of  the Netflix offering. With every title we add to the library, we remain focused on our goal of being an  expert programmer, licensing an overall mix of content that delights our members, rather than trying to  be a very broad content distributor.     A distributor aggregates and provides access to wide swaths of content, but usually on a non-exclusive  and undifferentiated basis.  Comcast and DIRECTV are distributors.    A programmer takes an active role in creating a curated content offering, providing selective and often  exclusive content that is differentiated from other programmers.  HBO and Netflix are programmers.     As a programmer, we seek to offer our members high quality and high engagement premium content  choices. To do so, we have increasingly licensed content on an exclusive basis to ensure our members  are receiving an entertainment experience that cannot be replicated by our competitors.    Coincidently, this means we are selective about what titles we add to the service and what content  agreements we renew. Since we can’t license everything and also maintain low prices, we seek out  content that delivers the highest member engagement relative to its cost. This also means that we’ll                         8      forego or not renew content that doesn’t optimize for engagement and cost efficiency across the  available content choices within the constraints of our budget. This was the case when we did not renew  our Starz agreement in 2011, as well as our A&E / History Channel agreement last year. In all cases, we  use our extensive member viewing data to inform our programming choices to create a unique and  compelling offering that will most delight our members.    As part of our selective programming strategy, we focus not only on major studio output, but also on  providing our members with interesting and compelling independent content. Because of our  merchandising capabilities as well as our massive member base, we enjoy high engagement on what  would otherwise be considered non-mainstream content. For example, we currently stream three of the  2013 Oscar nominated documentary feature films on Netflix: “5 Broken Cameras,” “The Invisible War,”  and “How To Survive a Plague.”  In addition, many of the top independent films of the year can only be  found on Netflix.   Improving Member Streaming Experience    We are focused on creating an experience that delights our members and increases their engagement.  Our large member base allows us to do more and bigger experiments, which enables us to learn what  works best for our members more quickly than our competitors.    We recently launched Netflix on Windows 8 with a great user interface that works for both  mouse/keyboard and touch screen, and we launched Netflix on the Wii U with a second screen  experience for choosing what to watch. We are also pioneering the use of tablets and handsets as  second-screen choosing devices for TV viewing.    As part of the Netflix search experience, we have made it even easier for members to explore our vast  catalog and we'll continue working on improving the algorithms that power our recommendations, as  well as making search more effective for our members.  Another way we’re now leveraging our  recommendations system is to identify the audience most likely to enjoy each Netflix Original from our  diverse upcoming slate.  Unlike linear television that needs to build an audience for the premiere  showing, our tools are designed to maximize the value of each show over the long term.  We’ll learn the  characteristics of the members who love each show and promote to potential viewers with similar traits.    To make our suggestions more useful, we have recently started testing several variations of a personal  profiles feature that creates suggestions for different members of the household based on their own  taste, not confused by the viewing of their kids or others sharing the same subscription.  If this test  succeeds in increasing member engagement, we will roll out profiles more broadly later this year.    Last year, Netflix launched Open Connect to enable ISPs to receive Netflix media data directly, and for  free, at various standard interconnection points or within their own networks.  This is more efficient                         9      than going through intermediaries, and provides consumers with the highest quality picture and least  rebuffering. Most international ISPs and many domestic ISPs already receive their traffic via Open  Connect.  Our newest and best video formats (Super-HD and 3D) that are larger and more challenging to  deliver are only available on Open Connect.  We are working hard to get all ISPs to directly connect for  free to Open Connect to improve their customers’ broadband experience.    DVD    DVD memberships declined less than we had anticipated this quarter to 8.2 million (above the top end  of our guidance range), driven by stronger than forecasted retention.  The decline has slowed in each  quarter since we introduced the DVD-only plan.     The domestic DVD segment delivered $128 million of contribution profit in Q4, representing a 50%  contribution margin, higher than anticipated due to higher members and lower than expected DVD  usage.  We anticipate a decline in DVD contribution margin sequentially from Q4 to Q1 as usage  seasonally increases in Q1 and the expected USPS rate increase of $0.01 each way takes effect in  January.    The US Postal Service is under financial stress, but we don’t foresee service changes this year that have a  material negative impact upon us or our members.    Global Profitability:  Q4 Results & Q1 Outlook    Consolidated Q4 net income of $8 million ($0.13 EPS) exceeded our guidance due to contribution profit  out-performance primarily in our domestic and international streaming segments. Net income was flat  quarter over quarter, as increased domestic streaming contribution profit (up $18 million) more than  offset a $3 million decline of DVD contribution profit, and a $12 million increase in international losses  (driven by the launch of the Nordics market), while global operating expenses were flat sequentially.     We anticipate net income will be relatively flat quarter over quarter in Q1, as improvements in both  domestic and international streaming profits will be offset by a decline in DVD contribution profit and  increases in global operating expenses.  Free Cash Flow & Capital    In Q4, the gap between free cash flow (negative $51 million) and net income (positive $8 million)  widened as a result of payments for the original programs coming to Netflix in 2013. Significant uses of  cash in the quarter (relative to net income) were cash payments for both originals and non-originals                         10      content (in excess of the P&L expense), cash payments for PP&E (related to the continued rollout of our  Open Connect servers), and tax payments.    In the past, we have managed our content licensing agreements such that cash payments in any quarter  do not exceed 110% of the P&L expense (in other words, if our P&L expense was $200 million in the  quarter, our cash payments for content would not exceed $220 million in the quarter).  As we shared on  our last earnings call, our original programming will require more up-front cash payments than most  other content licensing agreements, raising this ratio (of cash to P&L for content) to as high as 120% in  certain quarters with material originals payments. The bulk of our remaining cash payments for our  current originals will be in Q1, driving FCF materially more negative than Q4, and then FCF will improve  substantially in subsequent quarters.    As highlighted previously, we have sufficient cash on hand to fund our current slate of originals and  ongoing expenses, and to maintain an adequate reserve, before returning to positive FCF.    In addition, we are exploring taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment to refinance  our $200 million in outstanding notes and raise additional cash through new debt financing.  This would  give us additional reserves as well as increased flexibility to fund future originals.  Miscellaneous    For management purposes, we look at the relatively modest overhead expenses (mostly personnel) in  our global content acquisition group as part of G&A, and as such we don’t allocate them across our  three business segments.  For our global marketing team, however, the also relatively modest overhead  costs were historically allocated entirely to just the domestic streaming segment.  Starting in Q1,  marketing overhead will be part of G&A, consistent with how we treat content overhead, and will not be  allocated to the domestic streaming segment.  This is about $5 million of expense in Q1, so the change  will slightly increase domestic streaming contribution profit, and slightly increase global operating  expense by the same amount.  There is no change to operating income, net income, cash flows, or any  other global metric.     Starting in July, Reed has some 10-year employee options expiring every month, and he plans to sell  upon forced-exercise.  He has no other sales planned.    Carl Icahn became a 10% investor last quarter at approximately $58 per share.  We have no further  news about his intentions, but have had constructive conversations with him about building a more  valuable company.                                 11      Business Outlook      Summary    Netflix offers consumers what they want -- compelling content and control over how and when they  watch it.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and  net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with  GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.        Forward-Looking Statements    This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding contribution margin; future content deals, rollout of  social sharing features, competition, impact and value of our original content,  business outlook in our  international markets; expansion to additional international markets; our content programming  strategy, improvements to our member experience, business outlook for our DVD segment; free cash                         13      flow and usage of cash; member growth, including total and paid; revenue, and contribution profit (loss)  for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings  per share for the first quarter of 2013.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; the  continued availability of content on terms and conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in  service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our  service; competition and widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 10, 2012.

We added over 2 million members to the  service, launched to great reception our first Original series of 2013 House of Cards, and improved our  streaming contribution margin above our 100 bps target.    We added 2.03 million members compared to 2.05 million in the prior quarter and 1.74 million in Q1 a  year ago.      In terms of comparing our Q1 net additions to last year’s performance, it’s worth reminding everyone of  the change we made to our member definition as detailed in the January 2012 Investor letter in which  we immediately excluded from our member count those members who are on payment hold.  This more  conservative definition translated into ~300,000 fewer net additions in Q1 2012, so we would have  reported about 2 million.  Therefore, think of Q1 2013 net adds as roughly comparable to the year ago  period, a positive outcome.      For many years, as a DVD-based business, Q1 net additions have been larger than the prior quarter net  adds, but not this Q1.  For DVD, factors such as a robust holiday DVD release slate and publicity for new  movies created by the awards season telecasts likely influenced this pattern, boosting Q1 relative to Q4.   This Q4 to Q1 pattern appears to be different for our streaming business, and this is our first clean  streaming holiday season to show the seasonality.    We’ve seen improvements in our business over the last year in content, in our product, in optimizing the  way we process payments, and in the general recovery of our brand.  All of these improvements  contribute to higher member satisfaction, which we see in higher year-over-year levels for members’  likelihood to recommend our service.     During the quarter, we continued to grow members and revenue faster than content spending and our  domestic streaming contribution margin increased to 20.6% in Q1, a further 140 bps of improvement  from Q4 (not including 70 bps resulting from reclassifying marketing overhead)1.  On a year-over-year  basis, we expanded contribution margin over 600 bps on essentially flat marketing expense.  Our target  remains to expand contribution margin on average about 100 bps per quarter.  We introduced our  streaming only plan at $7.99 in 2010.  We’ve been adding more content to the service ever since, and  are very happy with membership growth at this low price point.      In terms of significant U.S. licensing deals, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Turner  Broadcasting and Warner Bros. TV group for selected complete previous seasons of popular shows from  Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation and Adult Swim, as well as the TNT serialized drama Dallas.  We also reached agreement directly with Warner Bros. TV to bring to Netflix members earlier, and more                                                   1 As previewed in our January 2013 Investor letter, starting this quarter, marketing overhead is now part of global  G&A (consistent with how we treat content overhead) and is not allocated to the domestic streaming segment.                         3  exclusively than ever before, complete previous seasons of some of the hottest shows on network and  cable TV -- including Revolution (NBC), The Following (Fox), Longmire (A&E), and Political Animals (USA).    The deal with Warner Bros. Television is significant because it illustrates our evolution to a curator of  select programming. Many of our earliest deals were with networks and cable channels and included  some shows that have not proven successful. Those networks and channels are also uniquely leveraged  by their cable and satellite partners to hold back for as long as possible the availability of shows while  limiting the kind of on-demand exclusivity we favor.  By dealing directly with the producers of TV shows,  we are better positioned to pick just those shows that we believe will work best and secure rights that  may be otherwise blocked by TV carriage and transmission deals.    In that same spirit, we’re also thrilled with our unique arrangement with Fox Television Studios to bring  a third season of the fan favorite The Killing exclusively to our U.S., Canadian and Latin American  members 90 days after the season finale airs on AMC.  In the U.K., Ireland and Nordic countries, new  episodes will premiere weekly and exclusively on Netflix, just days after the U.S. broadcast.     As we continue to focus on exclusive and curated content, our willingness to pay for non-exclusive, bulk  content deals declines.  At the end of May we’ll be allowing our broad Viacom Networks deal for  Nickelodeon, BET, and MTV content to expire.  We are in discussions with them about licensing  particular shows but have yet to conclude a deal.  We continue to do lots of other business with Viacom  around the world, such as our exclusive Pay1 deal for Paramount titles in Canada.      With all the recently added fresh programming from Disney, Cartoon Network, Hasbro’s The Hub and  Dreamworks Animation, we have a great kids offering.      As we discussed a quarter ago and in our April 2012 Investor letter appendix, we generally expect Q2 net  additions to be lower than prior year Q2 due to increased seasonality of net additions.  This coming Q2,  however, we have Arrested Development, and momentum from lots of new content coming to the  service, so we expect to see slightly higher net additions than Q2 a year ago.      Last quarter we shared with you that of our “top 200” titles, Amazon Prime Instant Video had only 73.   This quarter it was 74.     International    Our international membership grew by 1 million during the quarter to a total of 7.1 million, generating  14% of global revenue.  During Q4 2012, we added 1.8 million net international members and 1.2 million                         4  during Q1 20122.  The Nordics and the UK/Ireland launch in Q4’12 and Q1’12, respectively, resulted in  an elevated level of net additions in those launch quarters as we benefited from the initial growth of a  new territory.     In all of our markets, we saw growth and improved profits or reduced losses. International contribution  losses improved $28 million sequentially, better than expected due primarily to less growth in content  spending than forecast. For Q2, we are not forecasting a substantial improvement in contribution losses  because we are increasing our international content spending in line with revenue growth.     In early Q2, we implemented a modest price increase (15 BRL to 17 BRL) in Brazil, approximately  matching local inflation over the last two years.      We plan to launch an additional European market during the second half of 2013.  We’ll have more to  say about this on our July earnings call.       Original Series    On February 1, we premiered all 13 episodes of House of Cards to enormous popular and critical  acclaim. The global viewing and high level of engagement with the show increased our confidence in our  ability to pick shows Netflix members will embrace and to pick partners skilled at delivering a great  series.  The high level of viewer satisfaction implies we are able to target the right audience without the  benefit of existing broadcast or cable viewing data and the strong viewing across all our markets gives us  faith in our ability to create global content brands in a cost-effective, efficient way.     Our decision to launch all episodes at once created enormous media and social buzz, reinforcing our  brand attribute of giving consumers complete control over how and when they enjoy their  entertainment.  Some investors worried that the House of Cards fans would take advantage of our free  trial, watch the show, and then cancel.  However, there was very little free-trial gaming  - less than 8,000  people did this - out of millions of free trials in the quarter.     On April 19, we launched all 13 episodes of Hemlock Grove, a horror thriller from Eli Roth and we’re very  pleased with its early performance.  Hemlock Grove was viewed by more members globally in its first  weekend than was House of Cards and has been a particular hit among young adults.    Up next is the long-awaited and much-anticipated fourth season of comedy cult favorite Arrested  Development, with all 15 episodes available on May 26.                                                      2 The effect from the change to our member definition as discussed in the domestic streaming segment was very  small for international (23,000 fewer Q1 2012 international net additions) because we had already excluded  members on payment holds in LATAM.                         5  This summer, we’ll launch Orange Is the New Black, a prison dramedy from Weeds creator Jenji Kohan;  Derek, a heartfelt, funny look at life in a senior center from Ricky Gervais; and, later in the year, season  two of Lilyhammer.    During the quarter, we announced two new Original series coming to Netflix. Turbo: F.A.S.T. (Fast Action  Stunt Team), is a collaboration with DreamWorks Animation and our first ever series for kids. It will  continue the story of the summer DreamWorks Animation movie Turbo when it premieres on our  service in December.    Coming to Netflix in late 2014, will be Sense8, a new Sci-Fi thriller from the Wachowski siblings, who  created the Matrix Trilogy and Cloud Atlas, and J. Michael Straszynski, creator of the hit TV series  Babylon 5.     As we’ve said before, our first slate of Originals will represent a small percentage of both our content  budget (i.e. P&L expense) and total viewing hours this year, though cash use is front loaded relative to  the P&L expense.    Long term, we believe the value of our Original series in driving acquisition and retention improvements  will be borne out as we add more seasons of already popular shows like House of Cards and further  series.  Harry Potter was not a phenomenon in book one, compared to later books in the series.      Marketing    With the broader acceptance of streaming and Internet Television, more of our marketing now focuses  on the content we bring to members.  The launch of House of Cards provided a halo effect on our entire  service and spoke to the quality of experience members can expect from Netflix.      In addition to our emphasis on Original series, we are delivering targeted messages as high-profile titles  arrive on the service.  This marketing strategy is designed to attract new members, excite current  members to watch more, and encourage past members to come back.    Our media spend is increasingly digital, with a moderate reduction in our use of linear TV advertising.  We have seen encouraging results from online video ads and we will continue to find new ways to reach  consumers at key stages along their consumer journey from initial awareness to free trial.                                      6  Improving Member Streaming Experience    We continue to make the member experience better through AB testing, measuring the impact of our  innovation on acquisition, retention, and hours of viewing.    During the quarter, we continued to explore new payment vehicles with a focus on Latin America,  adding direct debit with a number of banks in the region.  Adding direct debit has lowered one of the  barriers to membership in the region and is an example of how we generally expand the acquisition  funnel, a focal point for our teams.    We had a number of wins during the quarter with new algorithmic techniques to match members with  content they’ll enjoy, driving more Netflix watching. The launch of House of Cards allowed us to explore  new ways to promote significant individual titles to those members who are most inclined to watch  without over-promoting to members with different tastes and are pleased with the results.     In many households, Netflix is used by different family members, and we tested a “Profiles” feature that  separates the activity of each individual. This enables us to offer more relevant personalized suggestions  for each individual, and we expect to roll out profiles globally in the coming months.     In January, the Video Privacy Protection Act was updated, allowing us to launch social features in the  U.S, that we’ve been testing in the rest of the world since late 2011. We expect to see more social  discovery of content to watch, supplementing the existing taste-based techniques we have relied upon  to date.  We’ll continue to test and innovate around social features.        We also released the next major version of our Netflix player technology to our consumer electronics  partners to include in their Smart TVs and set-top boxes.  The new platform emphasizes size and  performance improvements, and offers dramatically faster playback startup (aiming to match the time  required for a linear channel change).  This new platform will appear in a few new devices in time for the  holiday season, and will roll out more widely in the spring 2014 refresh for many CE manufacturers.    We continue to realize gains (in availability, scalability, and cost savings) from our push to migrate our  technology to the cloud, and we recently launched the Netflix Cloud Prize as a way to accelerate  evolution of the Netflix Open Source platform. In addition, we are developing and sharing standards,  such as HTML5 video standards and encoding format standards, and we are actively working with our  studio suppliers to create a more robust supply chain for delivery of content.    A few members with large families run into our 2-simultaneous-stream limit. To best serve these  members, we’re shortly adding a 4-stream plan, at $11.99 in the U.S., and we expect fewer than 1% of  members to take it.                           7  DVD    DVD memberships declined modestly to about 8 million.  Combined with lower than expected content  costs, higher revenue drove a better-than-expected $113 million contribution profit in Q1, representing  a 46.6% contribution margin.  The expected sequential decline in DVD contribution margin was due to  seasonally higher usage in Q1 and the USPS rate increase of $0.01 each way that took effect in January.     Absent USPS rate increases, we’ve been able to maintain our DVD contribution margin as members and  shipment volume decline.  We anticipate continuing to be able to maintain the margins we see in the  first half of 2013 throughout the full year.  Consistent with our view last quarter, we don’t foresee USPS  service changes that will have a material negative impact upon us or our members for the remainder of  2013.    Going forward we’ll continue to provide our full DVD segment level reporting but will only provide  guidance on DVD contribution profit since that is what we focus on.      Global Profitability:  Q1 Results & Q2 Outlook    Consolidated Q1 net income was $3 million ($0.05 EPS) and includes a $16 million loss on  extinguishment of debt, net of taxes, related to the refinancing of our 8.5% bond in February.  Excluding  this loss, our net income would have been $19 million ($0.31 EPS), above our guidance because of the  outperformance across all three of our operating segments.  Net income, excluding the loss on  extinguishment of debt, was up sequentially as an $18 million increase in domestic streaming  contribution profit and a $28 million decrease in international losses more than offset a $14 million  decline of DVD contribution profit and an increase in global operating costs.    In Q2, our guidance implies net income roughly flat with Q1 (absent the loss on extinguishment of debt).   We had a tax benefit in Q1 related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit that will  not repeat in Q2, so higher sequential operating profit will be partially offset by higher sequential taxes.    Free Cash Flow    Free Cash Flow of negative $42 million was $45 million lower than our positive $3 million in net income  in the quarter primarily due to payments for Originals and non-originals content in excess of the P&L  expense, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of the debt (a financing activity) and non-cash  stock compensation expense.  The investments that will continue to weigh on our cash flow relative to  net income are Originals and non-Originals content (ongoing) and our Open Connect conversion  (primarily in 2013).                         8  Capital     In February, we raised $500 million in 8 year 5.375% notes with investment-grade covenants and used  approximately $225 million of the proceeds to retire our 2007 8.5% notes. The refinancing of the notes,  while being favorable to capital costs in the long term, was the basis for the $25 million pretax, or $16  million net of tax, loss on extinguishment of debt in the quarter.     With the fundraising, we finished the quarter with a little over $1 billion in cash and equivalents.   Market conditions were attractive and we were pleased to add cash to increase our reserves and afford  us the flexibility to invest in additional Originals.      We will convert the 2011 TCV $200 million convertible notes tomorrow (April 23rd) into the  corresponding 2.3 million shares.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures,  during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make  investments and for certain other activities.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net  income and diluted earnings per share provide useful information as these measures exclude losses that  are not indicative of our core operating results.  However, these non-GAAP measures should be  considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted  earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.      Forward-Looking Statements    This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding our approach to licensing content; member acquisition  seasonality; expansion to additional international markets and international contribution profits (losses);  impact and value of our original content; marketing strategy; improvements in our member experience,  including the rollout of our profiles and social features; conversion of our $200M convertible notes;  business outlook for our DVD segment; free cash flow and usage of cash; member growth, including  total and paid; revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2013.   The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause  actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and  retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device  platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on  our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service;  competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013.  We undertake no obligation to update  forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press  release.                                                                                                                                                             11 Netflix, Inc.

The virtuous cycle we’ve  mentioned before of increased investment in streaming content, strong word of mouth and an  expanding range of devices continued to bear fruit. In the U.S., we ended the quarter with 24.6 million  domestic subscribers, 64% more than the comparable previous year period.  During the quarter, the streaming only plan continued to gain in popularity, with nearly 75% of our new  subscribers signing up for it. As a result, our average subscription price reverted to a slight quarter-over- quarter decline, after the one quarter impact in Q1 of our November 2010 price change.  With the rapid adoption of streaming, DVD shipments for Netflix have likely peaked.  Also, in Q2 the  total number of subscribers who were on hybrid plans (and, therefore eligible to receive DVDs) declined  slightly from Q1.   We’ve spoken frequently of how we are directing savings generated from declining DVD demand into  additional streaming content and marketing. During the quarter, we substantially increased sequential  spending on streaming content as titles from our new content deals (discussed below) became available  for streaming. At the same time, though, we maintained a disciplined approach to what content we  license and at what price, spending somewhat less on streaming content than we budgeted for in the  quarter. Also, DVD shipments came in even lower than forecasted, in part due to the popularity of our  streaming only plan.   The net impact:  our domestic operating margin came in at 16.3%, above our 14% target. Going forward  in the second half of 2011, we expect to increase our investment in streaming content, thus reaching  our 14% domestic operating margin target.         13.0%  11.6% 12.0% 11.8%  14.9%  13.0%  14.8%  16.0% 16.3%  Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Domestic Operating Margin  Actual Annual Targets     3  Domestic content licensing   During Q2, we secured great new content for streaming and expanded our existing partnerships with  movie studios and broadcast and cable networks.   For feature films, we reached agreements with Miramax and Revolution Studios to add several hundred  movies on a rotating basis, giving our subscribers access to critically acclaimed films such as “Pulp  Fiction,” “Good Will Hunting,” “Black Hawk Down,” “Across the Universe,” and “Shakespeare in Love” as  well as box office favorites like “Daddy Day Care,” “Hellboy,” and “Anger Management.” We also  announced a multi-year deal with Open Road Films to exclusively offer an exciting slate of first-run films  to watch instantly shortly after they are released on DVD.  The first films from our previously announced  deal with Relativity Media have just started to flow and “The Fighter” and “Skyline” are shaping up to be  big hits with our subscribers.  Netflix members love great television shows as much as they love movies, and are now spending over  half of overall streaming hours enjoying a wide range of TV programming.  In Q2, we added thousands of  TV episodes through significant multi-year renewals with Viacom’s media networks and NBC Universal.  These agreements not only add new seasons of shows that have enjoyed great success among our  subscribers, but expand to new shows licensed by these companies.   In the case of NBCU, we’ve secured access to great NBC primetime hits on a prior-season basis, including  “30 Rock,” “Parenthood,” and “The Office.” Complete previous seasons of cable favorites like SyFy’s  “Warehouse 13,” USA’s “Psych,” and E’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” are also part of the deal.   With Viacom, we’ve expanded our agreement to include a wide range of programming from MTV,  Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET and TV Land, including complete seasons of “Jersey Shore,”  “SpongeBob SquarePants,” “South Park,” “Hot in Cleveland,” and “Basketball Wives.”    In a few days, every episode of “Mad Men” will become available in syndication exclusively on Netflix.    Additional seasons will become available on Netflix once they complete their run on AMC.  Since Mad  Men is strongly serialized, we expect significant viewing of prior seasons as new viewers get hooked and  seek the back story during the upcoming fifth season and beyond.  Netflix subscribers now have access to a wide range of programming from all four major U.S. broadcast  networks and from nearly every major cable channel, as well as thousands of films, including those in  their first subscription window, from Paramount, MGM, Disney, Lionsgate and a host of mini-major and  independent studios.  In June, we told our members that Sony movies through Starz Plus would be unavailable to watch  instantly from Netflix due to a contract dispute between Sony and Starz, to which we are not a party.  As  we said then, we are hopeful these two valued partners will resolve this issue soon. Additionally, we  continue to be in discussions with Starz to renew our agreement beyond the first quarter of 2012.           4  Domestic competition  As we’ve said previously, our largest competitor over time is likely to be an improved MVPD service  offering more Internet video on-demand, and thus reducing the number of people who will be attracted  by a supplementary service like Netflix. HBO GO is an example of this: HBO subscribers can watch HBO  on-demand through their MVPD provider web interface (DishOnline.com, say), or through the HBO GO  dedicated application.    Over time, both the DishOnline application and the HBO GO application, amongst others, will likely get  built into smart TVs or be available in smart TV app stores.   While HBO GO and Netflix do not have  overlapping content, and many consumers subscribe to both Netflix and HBO, we do compete with HBO  for studio content and for viewers’ time. Our task is to consistently improve the quality of our service  and stay two steps ahead, so that consumers will continue to enjoy Netflix.  We are also mindful of Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime.   Hulu Plus added about 325,000 subs in Q2; we  added close to 2 million.   We invest much more than Hulu Plus in content, in marketing, and in R&D.    Since Hulu is likely to be sold in the near term, it is unknown who will run it and how much they will  invest in the subscription part of the Hulu service. We aren’t planning to bid on Hulu because most of its  revenue is from providing free ad-supported streaming of current season TV shows, which is not our  focus.  Amazon recently added thousands of films and TV shows, and includes them as a free service to  subscribers of its Prime shipping service.  We have vastly more streaming content, are available on more  streaming devices and are purely focused on subscription video streaming.  So far, we haven’t detected  an impact on our business from Amazon Prime.   Separating DVD by mail and streaming into two distinct plans in the U.S.  Earlier this month, we separated DVD by mail and streaming into two distinct plans, and we feel each  one represents unbeatable value in the marketplace.     Our new pricing, $7.99 for unlimited DVD by mail, is the lowest price for DVD by mail offered by anyone,  and we have the best service levels.   In addition, $7.99 for unlimited commercial-free streaming is an  extremely attractive proposition, with our new subscribers overwhelmingly choosing this plan.  Combined, for $15.98, these two plans provide a tremendous entertainment value for consumers who  want both DVD and streaming.  We didn’t change the pricing for our streaming only subscribers, and those members will get to enjoy  more and better streaming content going forward.  Subscribers who only want DVDs from us are happy  with the introduction of DVD only plans, because they can pay $7.99 instead of $9.99, a 20% savings.  It  is expected and unfortunate that our DVD subscribers who also use streaming don’t like our price  change, which can be as much as a 60% increase for them from $9.99 to $15.98, when it goes into effect  for each subscriber upon their renewal date in September.        5  Some subscribers will cancel Netflix or downgrade their Netflix plans.  We expect most to stay with us  because each of our $7.99 plans is an incredible value.  We hate making our subscribers upset with us,  but we feel like we provide a fantastic service and we’re working hard to further improve the quality and  range of our streaming content in Q4 and beyond.    In addition to separating the plans, we are setting up a dedicated DVD division, led by twelve-year  Netflix veteran Andy Rendich, to focus on running a successful DVD by mail service in the U.S. for a long  time.  Andy and his team will be located nearby in San Jose, and are already planning some great  improvements for the DVD service. Because we believe we can best generate profits and satisfaction by  keeping DVD by mail as a division, we have no intention of selling it. In Q4, we’ll also return to marketing  our DVD by mail service, something we haven’t done for many quarters.  Our goal is to keep DVD as  healthy as possible for as many years as possible.    Our estimate is that by end of Q3 in the U.S., we’ll have about 22 million people subscribing to our  streaming service, about 15 million people subscribing to our DVD service, and about 25 million total U.S.  subscribers (with about 12 million people subscribing to both streaming and DVD).       In Q3 we will see only the negative impact of the pricing change, given that the announcement was early  in the quarter and that the increases won’t take effect until late in the quarter (September 15th on  average).  We expect domestic net additions in Q3 to be lower than the previous year Q3, and because  of the timing of the price change, revenues will only grow slightly on a sequential basis.  In Q4, we expect domestic net additions to return to a pattern of year-over-year growth while revenue  will reflect a full quarter’s impact of the pricing changes, which could result in Q4 being our first billion  dollar global revenue quarter, driven by strong U.S. performance.        6  While we expect our revenue to increase in Q4 from this pricing change, we are still targeting a 14%  domestic operating margin because we will continue to increase our spending on streaming content,  ensuring the service remains by far the best value out there when it comes to enjoying instant, on- demand movies and TV shows.  Q4 will also be the first quarter with a clean separation of the costs for our DVD and streaming services.  In January, we’ll report on Q4 with greater segment detail, breaking out domestic DVD, domestic  streaming and international streaming. Domestic DVD will incorporate its own technology and  development costs, as well as G&A, providing a straightforward picture of operating income. Domestic  and international streaming share technology, development and G&A expenses, so we’ll be reporting  contribution profit (i.e. gross profit less marketing) for each segment as well as the shared global  streaming technology, development and G&A costs. Starting this quarter, contribution profit has been  added to our segment reporting as a new metric.  Canada results  We continue to generate strong subscriber growth in Canada, and we’re up to nearly 1 million  subscribers in just 10 months.  We continue to learn from our experiences in Canada in preparation for  other international markets.  We recently launched Canadian French support for our service, and Netflix  looks great, of course, in French:     The key to continued growth, both domestically and internationally, is constant improvements to the  service.  We’ll be adding more content to our Canadian service and now expect that we’ll come in at   between $1 million contribution loss and $1 million contribution profit in Q3.          7  Latin America and beyond…  Early this month, we announced that we would be launching in Latin America as our second  international market later this year. Consumers in 43 countries across Mexico, South America and the  Caribbean will soon be able to enjoy unlimited TV shows and movies streamed instantly over the  Internet to their TVs and computers at one low monthly subscription price. We will have more to say  about this new market at the time of launch, but we are very excited about the opportunity. Specifically,  Latin America represents a large and rapidly growing market of broadband households (currently, ~40  million), consumers there enjoy Hollywood content, and we are able to take advantage of economies of  scale by licensing content regionally.   As we said last quarter, we intend to launch our third international market in Q1 2012. Depending on  content licensing discussions underway, we may launch one or more new countries in Q1.  As in Latin  America, we intend to offer a compelling mix of Hollywood, regional and local content.   In April of this year, we anticipated generating international operating losses of up to $70 million in the  second half of this year, which we were comfortable with given the size of the opportunity in Latin  America. Our current estimate for international operating losses in the second half of 2011 is now up to  $80 million which includes pre-launch expenses for the one or more countries we may launch in Q1  2012.   New user interface on laptops  In June, we updated the Netflix website with a new interface to provide more focus on the TV shows &  movies available to watch instantly, making it even easier for subscribers to find something they’d love  to watch. The title images are larger, there are more of them on the page and play buttons appear when  you track over the title image. Star ratings, synopsis and other functions are also easier and more  intuitive to access.  We are always testing new approaches to improve the service, so we were very pleased that hours  viewed have increased since the new interface was launched. We also received tremendous feedback,  not all of it positive, on the change and are incorporating some of that feedback into making the user  experience even better. We’re constantly testing ways to improve the website experience and the  overall service.  Facebook  We’ve made great progress over the quarter on our Facebook integration and we’ll likely launch it  before our next earnings report.  At this point, we plan to launch this initiative only in Canada and Latin  America, as the VPPA (Video Privacy Protection Act) discourages us from launching our Facebook  integration domestically.  Under the VPPA, it is ambiguous when and how a user can give permission for  his or her video viewing data to be shared.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a simple  clarification, HR2471, which says when and how a user can give such permission.  We’re hoping HR2471  passes, enabling us to offer our Facebook integration to our U.S. subscribers who desire it.      8  Cord mending  For the second quarter in a row, U.S. MVPD households grew in Q1, adding nearly 500,000 additional  households and deepening evidence that cord-cutting in the past was prompted by economic hard times  rather than the substitution of over-the-top (OTT) services for cable.  Since MVPD households are growing while online video use explodes, the data suggests that OTT  services like Netflix are complementary to, rather than competitive with, cable television. In this way,  the growth of Netflix streaming is no different to the prior growth of the DVD rental market – both  supplemental to the programming offering of the MVPDs. Our subscribers overwhelmingly enjoy both  Netflix and the wide variety of sports, current season TV shows, news and entertainment available  through MVPDs.   Netflix beating Bit Torrent piracy  In May, analysts at Sandvine published a report on global broadband trends suggesting that people are  watching and downloading more video over the Internet than ever before. Given the popularity of our  streaming service and the growth we’ve experienced in streaming subscribers and hours viewed, we  were not surprised by this finding. What did pleasantly surprise us was how we compared to other  providers of Internet video. Our low cost, high quality, on demand streaming service has become so  good that the largest percentage of the Internet’s traffic is for paid content instead of illegal free peer- to-peer sites like Bit Torrent.  Over coming quarters we’ll see if we can recreate this “beat piracy” feat  outside of North America.    FCF & buyback  Free cash flow of $59.5 million increased sharply year-over-year (74%), but was down 25% quarter-over- quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by lower deferred revenue, and an interest payment in the  quarter, partially offset by higher net income.     $26  $26  $30  $38  $34  $8  $51  $79  $60  $32  $30  $31  $32  $44  $38  $47  $60  $68  Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Net Income and Free Cash Flow   (in millions)  Free Cash Flow GAAP Net Income     9  The expected ramp up in our streaming content investment discussed in our January and April letters is  reflected on our cash flow statements as a significant sequential increase in additions to our streaming  content library: $192 million in Q1 rising to $613 million in Q2.  The increase in library additions reflects  several large previously announced content deals (e.g. MTV, Miramax, Fox, CBS & NBCU) becoming  available for streaming, and therefore being recognized as assets on our balance sheet.  Due to this  increase in library assets, our streaming content liabilities also reflected a significant increase of $420  million related to all payments not yet due under these contracts.  As a reminder, when a content license agreement meets the criteria for library asset recognition, we  recognize the full value of the agreement as an asset in our content library while unpaid portions are  recognized as liabilities. Since many of our agreements are multi-year, the additions will be amortized  and the liabilities paid, in most cases, over several years. In sum, A/P and other non-current liabilities  (long-term A/P) will increase as titles from new deals become available on our service.  We’ve provided additional disclosures on our cash flow statements this quarter to help investors better  understand the accounting for our streaming content licenses – specifically, we have broken out the  change in streaming content liabilities from all other A/P and other non-current liabilities. We have also  separated amortization of streaming content from amortization of DVD content.  As we’ve stated previously, we continue to insist on close matching of cash and expense for our  streaming content deals.  Our Latin American launch will require some minor up-front spending that will  moderate our free cash flow in Q3.    We used $51.4 million in Q2 to repurchase 216,000 shares at an average cost basis of $238, and ended  the quarter with $376 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Debt  Our current $200 million of issued debt trades at a nearly 400 basis point spread to similar-duration  treasuries.   We don’t expect to issue additional debt while our pricing is at these BB levels.  Since we  used the $200 million for stock buyback at sub $100 prices, we are very happy with our debt issue  overall.  Our debt, which has an 8.5% coupon, is first callable in November 2013.            10  Business Outlook  Guidance  Domestic Q3 2011:    Total U.S. Subscribers  24.6m to 25.4m      U.S. Streaming Subscriptions  21.6m to 23.3m      U.S. DVD Subscriptions  14.6m to 15.7m  Revenue  $780m to $805m  Operating Income  $95m to $120m        International Q3 2011:    Subscribers  1,150k to 1,450k  Revenue  $19.5m to $23.5m  Operating Loss  ($27.5m) to ($22.5m)        Global Q3 2011:    Net Income  $39m to $58m  EPS  $0.72 to $1.07    Summary  We’re proud to be able to announce another strong quarter of subscriber and earnings growth.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important  liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is  available to repay debt obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other  activities.  Management believes that contribution profit is useful in assessing the relative contribution  to operating income of each segment by eliminating any allocation of Technology & Development and  G&A expenses that apply across these segments.  However, this non-GAAP measure should be  considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income and net  cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with  GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.                12  Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding increases in scope and quality of our streaming content,  operating margin targets, subscriber reaction as well as impacts to revenue, net addition and subscriber  mix arising from our recent service and price changes; a return to marketing DVD by mail; Canadian  contribution profit; international expansion plans and estimated operating losses related thereto; our  subscriber growth, revenue,  and operating income (loss) for both domestic and international operations  as well as net income and earnings per share for the third quarter of 2011. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing  subscribers; our ability to compete effectively; the continued availability of content on terms and  conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website or with third-party  computer systems that help us operate our service; competition and widespread consumer adoption of  different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.   A detailed discussion of these and other  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward- looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our  Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 18,  2011.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or  circumstances occurring after the date of this press release.          13        Netflix, Inc.

For Q3, we expect about 1.3 million net additions,  comparable to Q3’13 in which we premiered Orange Season 1.  We are pleased our net additions in the  U.S. remain on par with last year.       Our U.S. contribution margin expanded 460 bps y/y to 27.1%, as revenue continued to grow faster than  spending on content and marketing.  As previously mentioned, we’ll re-evaluate our current 400 bps y/y  margin improvement target once we achieve a 30% contribution margin sometime next year.  The three  models we are evaluating are 400, 200, and 100 basis points margin improvement per year over the  next few years.      Outside the U.S., we generated continued growth in all of our markets.  We ended Q2 with 13.8 million  international members, growing 78% y/y.  In September, we’ll be launching Netflix in Germany, France,  Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg.  This launch into markets with over 60 million  broadband households will significantly increase our European presence and raise our current  international addressable market to over 180 million broadband households, or 2x the number of  current U.S. broadband households.    Our international contribution loss of ($15.3) million has been rapidly approaching contribution  profitability as we see improvements across all existing markets.  Our broad success from Argentina to  Finland has convinced us to further invest aggressively in global expansion.  Our European expansion  this quarter will add new expenses to the segment, so we expect a consolidated contribution loss of  ($42) million for the international segment in Q3.  Even after our upcoming expansion in Europe, we’ll  only address about one-third (271 million of 728 million1 ) of current global broadband households,  providing a great opportunity to build on our international success beyond 2014.  As explained in our  Long Term Letter, our plan remains to run at about global break-even to fund investment in global  expansion.      In May, we raised prices modestly in most of our markets for new members on our two screens at-a- time HD plan, and introduced a one screen at-a-time, standard definition plan across our markets.  Our  two screen HD plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new members.  We expect ARPU  to rise slowly as members at the new prices grow as a percentage of total membership.  There was  minimal impact on membership growth from this price change.                                                        1 SNL Kagan   3    Content    Original Series     The release of Orange is the New Black Season 2 has been every bit the global media event we had  hoped for; critically acclaimed and embraced by a fervent and growing fan base.  In its first month,  Orange became the most watched series in every Netflix territory, with many members either watching  for the first time or re-watching Season 1, in addition to the 13 new episodes of Season 2.    Earlier this month, Netflix original series and documentaries received 31 Emmy nominations, more than  double the 14 we received in our first year of releasing original programming. In its first year of  eligibility, Orange received 12 nominations, more than any other comedy series, while nominations for  House of Cards grew from 9 last year to 13 this year. Notably, these two shows were nominated for  Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Drama Series while The Square, which received 4  nominations, is up for Outstanding Documentary. It is quite rare for a single network to receive  nominations in all three of these categories as well as Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead  Actress for both drama (Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright for House of Cards) and comedy (Ricky Gervais  for Derek and Taylor Schilling for Orange.)     Hemlock Grove debuted July 11 and has already begun to build on its Season 1 audience. We have been  very pleased with the second season of Derek that launched in May and with the launch of our latest  original documentary The Battered Bastards of Baseball.     In the coming weeks, we will premiere the all new 4th and final season of The Killing (8/1) and a new  adult animated comedy BoJack Horseman (8/22).  Also in August, we will release Mission Blue (8/15)  from the Oscar-winning director of The Cove, Fisher Stevens.     Reflecting the increasingly global nature of the Netflix service, we now have original series in production  around the world, involving some of the best storytellers working in television and film today. Marco  Polo, a historical adventure from Executive Producer Harvey Weinstein, is shooting in Kazakhstan and  Malaysia.  In New York there is Marvel’s Daredevil, the first of our original series from Marvel Television,  as well as the already eagerly-anticipated third season of Orange is the New Black; while in Baltimore,  production is underway on the third season of House of Cards.  In the Florida Keys, the creators of  Damages (Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman, and Todd Kessler) are shooting a dark family thriller with an  ensemble cast led by Kyle Chandler, Sissy Spacek, Sam Shepard, Linda Cardellini, Ben Mendelsohn, and  Norbert Leo Butz.  Sense8, a mind-bending series from the Wachowskis (The Matrix trilogy, Cloud Atlas)  and J. Michael Straczynski (Babylon 5), began production in San Francisco last month, is now in Chicago,  and will shoot in many international locations this year.     4  In August, production begins in Los Angeles on Grace and Frankie, a comedy led by Jane Fonda, Lily  Tomlin, Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston; and in Colombia, Brazilian director José Padilha (Elite Squad,  Robocop) will begin filming Narcos with an all-star international cast led by Wagner Moura.    During the quarter, we announced our first-ever talk show, hosted by Chelsea Handler, the popular  comedian and best-selling author.  As with scripted programming, but unlike news or sports, fewer  people are watching talk shows live and are instead watching stacked episodes on DVR or online in the  days and weeks following initial airing.  Our intent is to produce a show with Handler and her team that  reflects this shift to on-demand enjoyment and that will appeal to a global audience.  Handler recently  taped her first special for Netflix -- a stand-up show that’s been sold out across the U.S., the U.K. and  Ireland -- and will produce four more in 2015 before we launch the talk show in early 2016.    Marketing    In Q2 we focused our marketing on the launch of the second season of Orange is the New Black in each  of our markets.  This campaign represents our largest content marketing push to date and we are  pleased with the reaction from fans.  Social media sentiment was overwhelmingly positive and search  volume validated that we had a big hit on our hands.  Season 3 next year should be even bigger.    Our Netflix brand advertising continues to resonate with consumers, highlighting the fun ways people’s  lives are enriched when they watch something great. Our well-received You’ve Got to Get it To Get It  campaign in Canada was extended with three new ads “Airport”, “Test Results”, and “Proposal” this  quarter. We ran the first ad in the campaign, “Pep Talk”, during the NHL playoffs and were delighted  when New York Rangers head coach Alain Vigneault picked up the joke during a pre-game press  conference, leading the NHL Network to interview the coach from our ad.    Another successful example of our brand advertising is our Viva Netflix campaign in Mexico which began  with “Abuelita,” featuring a fun take on local family viewing habits, quickly followed by  “Oribe” in which  Mexico’s star striker returns home from the World Cup slightly earlier than his spouse expected.    In Q2 we updated our logo from the red block with white letters to the cleaner red letters.  We were  pleased to execute this transition with the minimum of distraction.                5  In-Store Gift Cards Coming This Fall    We are introducing physical gift cards in select stores in the U.S., Canada,  Mexico, and Germany starting later this year.  In mature markets, gift cards will  extend our brand presence and make it easier to access Netflix. In newer  markets, gift cards help build the brand and provide an easier alternative for  consumers to join Netflix in markets with developing online payments.        Product    MVPD Set-Top Boxes    The Netflix app on Virgin Media set-top boxes in the U.K. continues to be a compelling streaming  experience that delivers above-median viewing and satisfaction.  We continue to gain traction in our  international markets with set-top box integration and, in the U.S., launched the Netflix app on the TiVo  platform with several regional MVPDs including Suddenlink, RCN, Grande and Atlantic Broadband during  the quarter.  MVPDs would rather their customers’ use Netflix on their set-top and remote than use  Netflix on Internet set-tops such as Apple TV, partially because that drives the pay-per-view  consumption for the respective set-top owner.      Android TV Platform     The Netflix app for Google\\'s Android TV platform will appear on TVs from Sony, Sharp, and others in the  coming months. Widespread adoption of Android TV can reduce the number of different platforms we  need to support to ensure Netflix is broadly available on Smart TVs delivering a consistently first-rate  experience, no matter the vendor. Android TV incorporates Google\\'s \"cast\" feature, allowing content  discovery on mobile devices and laptops with streaming delivered to the big screen.    Smart TV growing in Latin America    Post World Cup, the number of Smart TVs used for Netflix viewing in Latin American countries is at a  new high; in fact, the percentage of viewing from Smart TVs in Latin America is higher than any other  region we serve.  Members accessing Netflix on a big screen generally watch more and retain better  than members using smaller devices.    UHD 4K Video Quality    We are now streaming flagship content in UHD 4K to members with 4K Smart TVs, putting Netflix at the  leading edge of high-quality AV delivery. Already, Samsung, LG, and Sony have in retail around the world  6  4K Smart TVs, and House of Cards Season 2 and all seasons of Breaking Bad are now available for  streaming in the new format.  Content available to stream in 4K will grow steadily as several of our  original series are or will be shooting in 4K, including Marco Polo, Sense8, and Narcos.  UHD 4K will be an  Internet-centric format as linear TV will be late to switch their networks to UHD 4K.   Strong Net Neutrality  Our focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, is about preventing large ISPs from  holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance to extract payments from us, other Internet  content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent.  Our policy goals are for the FCC to not sanctify paid prioritization, and for the DOJ/FCC to block the  merger of Comcast/TWC, or at the very least, to require as condition to approving the merger that the  combined entity be prevented from charging for interconnection.  6.3 Million U.S. DVD Memberships  Our DVD-by-mail business continues to satisfy 6.3 million members.  Contribution profit for the segment  was $92.8 million in the quarter, as expected, and we anticipate $90 million for Q3.  A year ago in Q2,  we lost 475k DVD memberships.  In Q2 this year it was only 391k.   DVD and Blu-ray offer amazing and  comprehensive selection that keeps a core membership uniquely satisfied.  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are here:  April 2014, January 2014, October  2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013, October 2012, July 2012.  Summary We have a huge global opportunity ahead and a lot of challenges too.  We are thrilled for the creators of  our original series and documentaries who earned 31 Emmy nominations this year, and whose  incredible work is being enjoyed by many of our 50 million members.  7  Sincerely,                                                                                           Reed Hastings, CEO      David Wells, CFO                                                                                                                         21st July 2014 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview at 2 p.m. Pacific  Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  8  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance; content  offerings; marketing; gift cards; device and platform integration; member growth domestically and  internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, average revenue per subscriber, contribution  profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international  operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash  flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could  cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service  disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, widespread consumer adoption  of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward- looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our  Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.   The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance  will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our  Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to  reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                 9 Netflix, Inc.

This growth underscores the value of our increased spending on an ever-broader  selection of TV shows and movies, our constantly improving personalization technology, and the Netflix  brand.

The virtuous cycle we’ve mentioned previously of increased investment in streaming content,  strong word of mouth and an expanding device ecosystem truly worked for us in the quarter.   In  addition, we spent record amounts marketing Netflix, per the margin discussion below.    Looking forward, our prior period comps  for net adds are going to get tougher, and while we expect our  net adds the rest of this year to continue to exceed those of the prior year, it won’t be at a pace of  nearly 2X like in Q1. With net adds forecast to grow every quarter on a Y/Y basis, we remain in the first  half of the S curve of adoption. As always, we will remain focused on improving our service, keeping  Netflix in the first half of the curve, and thereby increasing Y/Y net adds, as long as possible.   Our pure streaming plan and a price increase on our hybrid offerings were put into place in November  2010, and the price increase largely took effect in Q1. As a result, our average subscription price  increased sequentially from Q4 to Q1. During the quarter, new subscribers embraced the pure  streaming and hybrid plans in roughly equal numbers. Going forward, we believe the ASP trend will  revert back to slight Q/Q decline as pure streaming becomes a larger part of the overall subscriber mix.  Domestic Operating Margin  In January, we spoke of redirecting the savings generated from a flattening DVD shipment trend into  additional streaming content and marketing. We took marketing up as much as was efficient in Q1.  But  as we anticipated in January, the lead time required to complete increasingly large and complex content  deals meant we weren’t able to spend the entirety of these funds. That, coupled with stronger-than- expected subscriber growth, and hence additional revenue and profit, meant our domestic operating  margin in Q1 increased above our 14% target margin to 16% (see graph below).    9.1%  13.0%  11.6% 11.9% 11.7%  14.8%  13.0%  14.9%  16.0%  Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Domestic Operating Margin      3  Going forward in Q2 and beyond, we expect DVD shipments to decline slightly Y/Y, spending on  streaming content to increase substantially, and spending on marketing to decline from Q1, bringing our  domestic operating margin back to our desired goal of around 14%.  As we’ve stated previously,  domestic gross margin also should return to the 30% -35% range as we spend more on streaming.  Q1 Consolidated Earnings Outperformance   Our consolidated net income of $60.2 million and diluted EPS of $1.11 were at the high end of our  guidance range due to the earnings outperformance in the U.S discussed earlier.  As we’ll discuss later in  the letter, our international loss in Canada was right in-line with our guidance, with lower costs  offsetting slightly lower-than-anticipated subscriber revenue.   Domestic Streaming Content   In Q1, we completed several important streaming content deals, bringing in additional first-time  partners, extending and expanding relationships with other providers and pioneering some new  approaches we believe will help Netflix continue to differentiate itself. The result is that Netflix  subscribers can instantly enjoy a wider and better selection of TV shows and movies than ever before.   Our agreement with CBS is particularly notable, as Netflix is now the only online premium subscription  service that offers shows from all four broadcast networks, as well as many of the largest cable TV  networks.  The arrangement includes only a few on-air shows at present, but provides the framework  for future shows to appear on Netflix while immediately unlocking a broad selection of classic television  episodes.  With Fox and Lionsgate, we increased the scope of our deals to increase the quality and quantity of TV  shows available for our subscribers to stream, while obtaining off-network rights to five very popular on- air series, for the first-time in our history.   The Fox deal guarantees all previous seasons’ episodes of the top rated show “Glee” and the F/X hit  show “Sons of Anarchy” for years to come. This multi-year, non-exclusive, agreement ensures access to  current and all future episodes.  It is similar to a syndication deal, except that episodes are made  available the season after they air, unlike typical syndication deals that do not begin until a show  completes at least four seasons of broadcast. The first season of “Glee” and the first two seasons of  “Sons of Anarchy” are now available to stream on Netflix.   With Lionsgate, we obtained exclusive syndication rights for “Mad Men.” Beginning in July, the first four  seasons of this award winning series will be available to stream, with new seasons appearing every year  until the series is completed. For the first several years of our deal, those seasons will not be available to  other broadcast or cable networks. Separately, we extended and made exclusive our current Lionsgate  deals for the popular Showtime series “Weeds” and the Spike TV show “Blue Mountain State”.  As streaming grows, TV shows and feature films are being enjoyed in nearly equivalent volume by our  subscribers and our content acquisition team is focusing their attention accordingly.  We’ve recently  added lots of new TV episodes, and the profile and completeness of the shows continues to improve. As      4  for movies, we’ve recently added a large number of core catalog titles from Paramount that are  exclusive to Netflix against broadcast, cable and other over-the-top services and titles from Lionsgate  and MGM that are exclusive against other over-the-top services.   While the size of these deals and their impact on our P&L is often speculated about in the press,  spending typically takes place over multiple years and the amortized cost of these deals is taken into  consideration in our 14% target operating margin model.  House of Cards  Lots of attention was paid to our decision to license the exclusive rights to premiere Media Rights  Capital’s “House of Cards” series, planned for late 2012.  Rather than a shift in strategy towards original programming, our decision was driven by a desire to test  a new licensing model using a small portion of our content budget. Serialized dramas, like the original  BBC series on which “House of Cards” is based, have been big favorites on Netflix and we want to  confirm our theory that because we are click-and-watch rather than appointment viewing, we can  efficiently build a big audience for a well-produced serialized show .  This represents slightly greater  creative risk than we’ve taken in the past, but we think it’s reasonable given the popularity of the  original BBC show on Netflix and the modest percentage of our content budget it represents. If “House  of Cards” is popular enough on Netflix so that the fee we’ve paid is in line with that of other equally  popular content on Netflix at the time, we’ll consider it a success.   Ideally, we’ll license two or three similar, but smaller, deals so we can gain confidence that whatever  results we achieve are repeatable.    While we’re still negotiating the final details of this deal, both the P&L and cash costs would only begin  when “House of Cards” premieres in late 2012.    Cord Mending replaces Cord Cutting    Given what’s happened in the music and newspaper industries, producers of movies and TV shows  naturally enough fear Internet services will hurt their existing business. That fear was heightened last  year when, during some quarters, total MVPD households in the U.S. contracted for the first time in  history, leading to extensive speculation over two possible drivers of “cord cutting”: (1) the rise of  entertainment available via the Internet; and (2) the recession, specifically the decline in household  formation, rampant foreclosures, and the rise in unemployment.     Since last year, online video use has more than doubled and the recession has receded somewhat. So, if  online video use was driving cord cutting, the behavior would have intensified. On the other hand, if it  was the recession that was driving people to drop MVPD subscriptions, cord cutting would have  moderated. In fact, not only did cord cutting slow, it became cord mending with total U.S. MVPD  households growing in the latest estimates.          5  Simply put, the data shows that Netflix is a supplemental channel to MVPD. While Netflix is likely to  show huge growth again this year, we think MVPD cord cutting will be minimal to non-existent. We hear  some stories from customers who have Netflix and no MVPD service, but these are generally people  who rely on free broadcast TV (which is now in HD) and supplement with Netflix, rather than switching  from MVPD to online.      Recently, the CEO of an MVPD characterized Netflix as “rerun TV”.  While we don’t plan to use that line  in our next marketing campaign, he is fundamentally correct.   Our focus for TV shows is on prior season  TV and completeness of series, because this class of content enables us to license content broadly and  provide consumers a differentiated experience.  Also, when we offer prior seasons of “Glee” or “Mad  Men”, we think we grow the audience for current season on MVPD.  We hope over time that HBO and  Showtime will let us prove this proposition for them.   We think more and more evidence that prior  season on Netflix helps current season on MVPD will become apparent from our deals with Disney,  Viacom, CBS, NBCU and others.      Looking at it from all of these angles, content owners that license to Netflix make more money – now  and in the future – than content owners who don’t license to Netflix. A few media executives are still  vocal about their fears of negative long-term impact on MVPD subscriptions from Netflix, but the  evidence continues to pile up against their concerns.   Our subscribers overwhelmingly enjoy both their  Netflix and the variety of sports, current season TV shows, news and entertainment available through  MVPDs.      Competition    Over the past 12 months, both Hulu Plus and free video on Amazon Prime have launched.  We also think  Dish Networks is likely to launch a substantial subscription streaming effort under the Blockbuster  brand.   Our competitive strategy relative to other streaming services is simply to grow as fast as we can,  so we can afford more content, more marketing, and more R&D than our competitors.       Our biggest competitor over time may be another service with a similar model to Netflix, such as Hulu  Plus, or it may be free on-demand Internet video as a part of a consumer’s MVPD package, namely TV  Everywhere.   This free bundling of a subset of our functionality within a larger subscription service is a  classic way for an incumbent to leverage its strength. While TV Everywhere is not a strong offering  today, it is likely to become much better over the coming years. We’ll continue to push ahead,  developing an ever-better user experience to differentiate Netflix, and exploring exclusive rights, where  it makes sense, such as our “Mad Men” deal, so that we remain complementary to MVPD.  Several studios have begun allowing MVPDs to offer a premium $30 early window pay-per-view option  for the home. Additionally, some studios are marketing titles on a PPV basis through the Apple app store  and on Facebook.  We don’t think this PPV activity will have a material impact to Netflix growth.   PPV is  a good way for content owners to maximize profits before a title is released for subscription.  In PPV, the  brand is the individual piece of content, a very different model from the subscription business.       6    DVD was a Booster Rocket, but is not a Differentiator    We believe that DVD will be a fading differentiator given the explosive growth of streaming, and that in  order to prosper in streaming we must concentrate on having the best possible streaming service.  As a  result, we are beginning to treat them separately in many ways.  Already, if you look at our signup page  for non-members, it is all about streaming.  Having said this, DVD rental is still a great business for us,  and we are working on solutions to make sure DVD continues to be a profitable business for us in the  years ahead, but it is not core to winning in streaming at this point.      International  Our growth in Canada was strong and consistent throughout Q1. Less than seven months from launch,  we ended the quarter with just over 800,000 subscribers. We are still learning the seasonality curve and  nuances specific to Canada, however, and we slightly over-forecast the quarter.    During the quarter, we made great progress in increasing the quality and volume of content available to  our Canadian subscribers. At the end of Q1 we began an output deal with Paramount, in which all of its  movies will be available on Netflix streaming just a few months after DVD release.  In addition we  licensed several popular TV series from Sony, including “Breaking In”, and “Mad Love”, and from Fox,  including “Prison Break”, “Firefly”, “Arrested Development”, and “Saving Grace”.  In Q2, we will continue  to increase our content spending in Canada and begin to incur some small expenses for our second  international market, both of which are reflected in our guidance for international operating loss. Then,  after achieving profitability in Q3 in Canada, we will stay at approximately break-even in Canada for a  few quarters in order to further strengthen the availability of our streaming content there.  We shared in our letter last quarter that if early results in our second international market confirmed  our belief that we can reach positive operating income within eight quarters of launch, we would launch  successive international markets.   We also stated we expected to report approximately $50 million in  operating losses for international in the second half of the year due to the launch of our second  international market.   We now anticipate $50 to $70 million in operating losses in the second half,  which we are comfortable with given the size of the opportunity.  We’ve also decided to make some  early content commitments for a third international market given our high probability of success in our  second international market.  These third international market commitments won’t materially affect our  P&L until next year, and we intend to launch the third international market in early 2012.      Data caps    Below is a recent screen shot of Google’s home page in Canada.  You can see that Rogers, a leading ISP  and MVPD in Canada, intercepted the Google page, and inserted the Rogers’ data cap warning screen at  its top.   It stands to reason that Canadian consumers subjected to such data caps – and outrageously      7  high overage charges of $1 or more per gigabyte – will have a less positive view of Internet use and  online video in particular.       In response to these excessive $1+ per gigabyte fees,  we’ve recently changed the default setting for  Canadian Netflix members to an encoding that consumes only 9 gigabytes for 30 hours of viewing versus  30 -70 gigabytes for 30 hours of viewing under our standard encoding.   The video quality is slightly  lower but still very enjoyable.    As a side note, data caps are actually a very poor way to manage demand and limit Internet congestion.    All of the costs of supplying residential broadband are for supporting the peak loads, typically Sunday  nights for residential customers.  Bandwidth consumed off-peak is completely free; it literally has no  marginal costs. If ISPs really wanted to limit their costs and congestion, they would limit speeds at peak  times.  But if their goal is instead to increase revenue, then making consumers pay $1 or more per  gigabyte is an excellent strategy.    When we state the marginal costs of residential wired gigabyte are below one penny, but are not zero,  that is because we are making the appropriate costing assumption that some of an average gigabyte is  transferred at costly peak times.    Canadian consumers have been outspoken against the excessive charges they face, and hopefully  Canadian ISPs will listen to them by raising the caps or abandoning them altogether.       8  The initial response from our Canadian consumers to our move to go to 9 gigabytes for 30 hours of  viewing has been positive, because it seems to relieve most of the fears of overage charges from their  ISP.   If the ISPs eventually abandon the caps, we’ll be able to provide the same peace of mind as well as  the best possible video quality to Canadians.     In the U.S., AT&T recently imposed caps of 250 gigabytes on U-verse fiber Internet subscribers, and 150  gigabytes on DSL subscribers, with a charge of approximately 20c per gigabyte over those limits.   We’ll  study how this affects consumer attitudes about Internet video, and take appropriate steps if needed.    Comcast has had 250 gigabytes caps for years without overage charges and that hasn’t been a problem  for Comcast customers or for us.    FCF & Cash & Buyback   Free cash flow of $79.3 million increased sharply on a Y/Y (108%) and Q/Q (55%) basis. The sequential  increase was driven by higher net income, higher non-cash stock compensation expense, no interest  payment in the quarter, and lower cash taxes, partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue.  To help keep our cash flow strong going forward, we will continue to insist on close matching of cash  and expense for our streaming content deals, but our international investments will slightly moderate  our free cash flow in the second half of the year.    Our strategy over recent years has been to use excess cash to buy back stock. We took a break from that  in Q4 2010 to reassess our cash needs and overall buyback strategy, but returned to buying back stock in  Q1. The objective of our buyback program is simply to return money to our shareholders, similar to a  dividend; consequently, we are neither price sensitive nor market timers. With this objective, we used  $108.6 million in Q1 to repurchase 502,000 shares at an average cost basis of $216.48. Since it was  bought throughout the quarter, it was just under 200,000 shares on a weighted average basis for the  $22  $32  $30  $31  $32  $44  $38  $47  $60  $15  $26  $26  $30  $38  $34  $8  $51  $79  Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Net Income and Free Cash Flow  (in millions)  Net Income FCF     9  quarter-end fully diluted count.  We plan to continue buying back stock, subject as always to an ongoing  analysis of appropriate levels of cash.  We ended the quarter with $343 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Business Outlook      In conclusion, we feel great about the growth we’ve generated, and are very aware that our success in a  fast-growing market makes us an even bigger competitive target. We’re working hard to stay ahead.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments, repurchase stock and for certain other activities.  However, this non- GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income  and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with  GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.                  11  Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding subscriber growth;  average subscription price; DVD  usage and shipments; streaming content spend; operating margins; content acquisition strategy; cord- cutting/mending; competition;  the fading differentiation of DVD; international expansion, including the  timing of breakeven in Canada and content spend for additional markets;  cash flow and payment terms;   our stock repurchase program;  our subscriber growth, revenue,  and operating income (loss) for both  domestic and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the second  quarter of 2011 . The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  subscribers and retain existing subscribers; our ability to compete effectively; the continued availability  of content on terms and conditions acceptable to us; maintenance and expansion of device platforms  for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service;  disruption in service on our  website or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition and  widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.

Our net  additions for Q1 were 0.22 million more than prior year Q1.  As we’ve discussed previously, U.S. net  additions in Q2 will generally be lower than in the prior year Q2, even in a year with full year growth,  due to increased seasonality.  This Q2, we expect our domestic net additions to be about 0.11 million  below the prior year Q2.      International performance in Q1 was also strong.  Membership grew by 1.75 million, bringing our  international total to 12.7 million members with 72% more net additions than prior year Q1.  Due to  rapid growth in our international segment we aren’t experiencing the same level of seasonality as in the  U.S., and we anticipate over 50% y/y growth in Q2 net additions despite slight headwinds from the  World Cup.    International revenues currently amount to 25% of our total streaming revenue and we anticipate our  international segment to eventually surpass our U.S. market, similar to other Internet firms.     International contribution losses shrank by $22 million q/q, with losses more than halved on a y/y basis  due to the strong growth in paid members.  Our present international segment is on a path to achieve  profitability this year.  However, our substantial expansion into new European markets (with  corresponding investments in content and marketing) in the second half of 2014 will keep our expanded  international segment at a net loss.  As we’ve discussed in prior investor letters, we intend to continue  our international expansion over the coming years, so our near term profits will be quite modest as we  invest in this large global opportunity.    Free cash flow in the quarter was $8 million versus net income of $53 million.  As we’ve highlighted in  previous letters, investments in our original series as well as certain non-original licenses, can require  higher initial cash payments over the P&L expense.  With further international expansion in the second  half of this year reducing net income, we expect free cash flow in Q4 to also be reduced.    Content    Our original programming initiatives gained momentum in Q1.  House of Cards, for which Season 2  debuted in February, attracted a huge audience that would make any cable or broadcast network happy.   The on-demand nature of Netflix means that as we promote Season 2, we can still see significant new  enjoyment of Season 1.      Netflix members were able to watch the acclaimed documentary MITT within a week of its premiere at  the Sundance Film Festival and we garnered our first Oscar nomination for the impactful documentary  3  The Square. During the quarter, we also announced our first original live-action comedy series, Grace  and Frankie, featuring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin.      Already this quarter, we’ve brought members additional episodes of Turbo F.A.S.T.  On May 30, we will  launch Season 2 of the Ricky Gervais series, Derek, in most territories and on June 6th, we’ll debut  Season 2 of Orange is the New Black, giving our members around the globe the opportunity to immerse  themselves in this rich and engaging world. The trailer will give you a sense of what’s in store for this  tremendously popular show.     Our summer line-up includes Hemlock Grove Season 2, the animated comedy series BoJack Horseman  and the final six episodes of The Killing.  Momentum will continue throughout 2014 and into 2015 as we  bring our members additional kids series through our partnership with DreamWorks Animation, and  launch new original series including the epic adventure of Marco Polo; a psychological thriller from the  creators of Damages;  Marvel‘s Daredevil; sci-fi drama Sense 8 from the Wachowskis, and Narcos, an  action-drama series from Brazilian director José Padilha on the fall of Colombian drug kingpin Pablo  Escobar.     We are pleased with consumer reception to our early work, as demonstrated in a Morgan Stanley survey  from March, showing that 17% of respondents viewed Netflix as the service that offered the best  original programming, second only to HBO, and ahead of Showtime and Starz.  To have achieved this  recognition in our second year of original content creation is exciting and we are optimistic about  building on our initial success.      We compete for original series with many linear TV networks (CBS, FX, HBO, BBC, etc.) and several  Internet firms (Amazon, Hulu, Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo, etc.).  Our advantages against other Internet firms  are our scale in video and our focus.  Our advantages against linear TV networks are Internet on-demand  consumption and targeted show marketing.  The huge competition amongst all of us for great writers  and producers means there’s never been a more robust market for quality serialized television.      Outside of North America, we are also becoming the first-run home for many great U.S. TV series. We  are releasing those series one episode per week, in order to reduce the time international viewers must  wait for local availability.  Traditionally, even the most popular American series are withheld from  international viewers for several months at a minimum, which has contributed greatly to the growth of  piracy.  We are tightening that window to less than 7 days, and wherever possible, to within 24 hours.   The Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul, as well as From Dusk Till Dawn and Fargo, are among the  series premiering on Netflix in international territories.     We also continue to invest heavily in exclusive syndication licenses for some of the best series on  television.  For example, in the U.S., as Mad Men enters its final season, members can jump in or catch  up on every previous season’s episode on Netflix.  The Walking Dead, Scandal, Bates Motel, The  Following, New Girl, Sherlock and The Vampire Diaries are just a few of the exciting on-air series we offer  4  exclusively in this model.  Dexter, House and Breaking Bad are no longer in production, but continue to  be discovered and enjoyed everyday by a huge Netflix audience.    Marketing    In Q1, our marketing focused on launching House of Cards Season 2 across our global markets. We will  continue with this approach in Q2, with a significant push behind the global launch of Orange is the New  Black Season 2 on June 6th.    Original series represent a tremendous opportunity to raise awareness of, and build consumer  enthusiasm for, the Netflix brand. We’ll be investing more in marketing high-quality exclusive content,  and spending less on direct response advertising such as banner ads touting free trials.    Internationally, we’ve been developing new brand marketing campaigns to strengthen our connection  to local consumers. These campaigns are part of a global brand platform highlighting the many ways  people find delight in the Netflix experience.    Product    Today you can walk into a store, buy a new 4K television, take it home, and enjoy a limited selection of  streaming 4K content from Netflix.  We have House of Cards Season 2 in 4K, as well as an assortment of  nature documentaries.  The recent WSJ review for one of the Samsung curved-screen 4K TVs featured  our 4K content, which we want to be an increasing theme as 4K grows.  As 4K TVs become less  expensive and more accessible, we will increase our content available in 4K.  The best quality consumer  video in the world is now streaming Internet video, less than 10 years after YouTube’s 2005 start.    We continue to test small and large ideas in promoting the right content to each user.  In Q1, we refined  and developed the way we promote our original series on the service to better support follow-on  seasons, and we are exploring how to do so for selected exclusive catalog content.  We also tested and  rolled out our row-selection logic that chooses which categories of titles to show to each individual  based upon their previous behavior.       We remain very happy with the customer embrace of our MVPD set-top box integrations in Europe.   This quarter we will launch the first MVPD integrations in the U.S.  As we did in Europe, we will start  with U.S. MVPDs that use the TiVo set-top box and try to extend to non-TiVo devices after that.  From an  MVPD point-of-view, they would rather have consumers use Netflix through the MVPD box and remote  control than have consumers become accustomed to watching video from a smart TV or Internet TV  device remote control.      5  We continue to see more capable Internet television devices launched. Chromecast, Roku Streaming  Stick, and Amazon Fire TV (on which we expect to support voice search later this year) push the quality  of experience and price points for adapter products. Smart TVs from manufacturers like Sony, Samsung,  LG and Vizio are starting to evolve from Internet TV as a “bolt-on” to Internet TV as a critical and  integrated part of the overall device interface.  Roku TV will likely be available in the Fall as one of the  first Internet-centric TVs.  We expect this trend to continually decrease the friction required for our  members to access Netflix and enjoy great content.    As expected, we saw limited impact from our January price increase for new members in Ireland  (from  €6.99 to €7.99), which included grandfathering all existing members at €6.99 for two years.  In the U.S.  we have greatly improved our content selection since we introduced our streaming plan in 2010 at  $7.99 per month.  Our current view is to do a one or two dollar increase, depending on the country,  later this quarter for new members only.  Existing members would stay at current pricing (e.g. $7.99 in  the U.S.) for a generous time period.  These changes will enable us to acquire more content and deliver  an even better streaming experience.    ISP Performance: AT&T Fiber slower than DSL from others    Our long-term ISP performance index shows some positive data, and some surprising data, particularly  in the U.S.  The positive is that Comcast is providing a much improved Netflix experience to their  broadband subscribers, and now nearly all cable Internet households receive great quality Internet  video.  The surprising news is that AT&T fiber-based U-verse has lower performance than many DSL ISPs,  such as Frontier, CenturyLink & Windstream.  This reinforces our view that connectivity to the broader  Internet is critical to the quality of experience consumers receive.  The 249 customer comments on  AT&T’s anti-Netflix blog post indicate that AT&T customers expect a good quality Netflix experience  given how much they pay AT&T for their Internet service.  It is free and easy for AT&T to interconnect  directly with Netflix and quickly improve their customers’ experience, should AT&T so desire.      Strong Net Neutrality: No-fee Interconnect    The Internet faces a long term threat from the largest ISPs driving up profits for themselves and costs for  everyone else as detailed in our recent blog post.     If the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined company’s footprint will pass  over 60 percent1 of U.S. broadband households, after the proposed divestiture, with most of those  homes having Comcast as the only option for truly high-speed broadband (>10Mbps).  As DSL fades in  favor of cable Internet, Comcast could control high-speed broadband to the majority of American                                                   1  Adam Ilkowitz,” Surprise! Comcast Takes TWC,” Nomura Securities, February 13, 2014  6  homes.  Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit  providers and services such as Netflix.  The combined company would possess even more anti- competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers.  For this  reason, Netflix opposes this merger.  Competition    In Q1, Amazon changed strategies in the UK and Germany, closing LoveFilm as a streaming brand to  compete with Netflix.  They have repurposed their content deals to serve Amazon Prime Instant Video in  the UK and Germany, and are investing in creating awareness of this new model.  Amazon is not  currently offering subscription video within Prime in Canada, France, Italy, Spain or Japan. They may  choose to expand Prime Instant Video or to focus on tuning their three existing Prime Instant Video  markets: U.S., UK and Germany.  Since much of the content on Netflix and Amazon Prime (as well as  Hulu in the U.S.) is mutually exclusive, many consumers see value in subscribing to all three networks.      In general, we continue to believe that our biggest long-term competitor for entertainment time  remains the MVPDs improving through TV Everywhere, as they are doing with HBO Go.     6.7 Million DVD Memberships    Our DVD-by-mail business continues to delight 6.7 million members.  As expected, contribution profit  for the segment was $98 million in the quarter and we anticipate $92 million for Q2.  The breadth of  content choices available on DVD and Blu-ray is unrivaled.          7  Summary  We are approaching 50 million global members, but that is far short of HBO’s 130 million.  We are eager  to close the gap.        Sincerely,                                                                                           Reed Hastings, CEO      David Wells, CFO                                                                                                                         21st April 2014 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview at 2 p.m. Pacific  Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding pricing; international expansion and performance;  content offerings; marketing; MVPD integration; IP interconnection; competition; member growth  domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.  The Company provides internal forecast  numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers  based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                 9 Netflix, Inc.

       " 'Q116LettertoShareholders_W_TABLES_': 'Fellow shareholders,    We are off to a great start in 2016, expanding the Netflix service to 130 new countries in January and  finishing Q1 with over 81 million members on the strength of our fast growing slate of original content.  Since 2010, we have offered unlimited streaming for $7.99 per month in the US, and we hope to  maintain this affordable entry-price for a long time. As we’ve made vast improvements in our service  and content, consumers see even more value and our membership grows. Q1 was no exception and our  summary results are below.         1  Q1 Results\\xa0 Net additions in Q1 ‘16 amounted to a record 6.74 million, surpassing our prior high water mark of 5.59  million in Q4 ‘15 and against 4.88 million in the year-ago period. Of our 81.5 million members, 42% are  now outside of the US.  Operating income was $49 million vs. $97 million in the year ago quarter, as we  continue to invest in international markets.     Performance in the quarter benefited from the launch of several series, including \\u200bMaking a Murderer\\u200b (a  late December debut), \\u200bFuller House\\u200b (February), \\u200bHouse of Cards \\u200bSeason 4 (March) and \\u200bDaredevil\\u200b Season 2  (March), complemented by a diverse mix of new films, documentaries, series and kids shows available  globally.     In the US, we added 2.23 million members in Q1, against 2.28 million a year ago, and 2.25 two years ago.  Our forecast for the  quarter was low (at 1.75 million) because we underestimated the positive  acquisition impact of our major original content debuts.     US revenue rose 18% year-over-year, reflecting 14% growth in average paid memberships and a 3%  increase in ARPU. US contribution profit totaled $413 million, or a 35.5% margin, compared to 31.7% a  year ago.    International revenue increased 57% year-over-year, including the negative impact of currency (-$82  million on a y/y basis). Excluding F/X, international ARPU rose 7% year-over-year. Our Q1 international  contribution loss of $104 million came in better than forecast due to the timing of content spend.    Our established markets around the world are all growing, and in early Q1 we added 130 more  countries. By expanding broadly at once, we are learning more quickly about how best to please  consumers across a wide variety of cultures and markets.  In most of these markets, so far, Netflix is  offered only in English and payment methods are limited primarily to international credit cards. In the  coming quarters, we will add more local languages, content, payment options and customer support.     We are pleased Netflix is finding acceptance around the world. Consumers worldwide are delighted to  be able to enjoy our original and exclusive series and films instantaneously. We have lots of work to do  to make Netflix more relevant market by market, but the opportunity is amazing.   Q2 Forecast\\xa0\\xa0 As a reminder, the guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. For the  second quarter, we expect to add 2.5 million members with 0.5 million in the US and 2.0 million  internationally (versus prior year 2.4 million).     In the US, our Q2 net adds forecast of 0.5 million is in-line with prior years (0.5, 0.6, 0.6, and 0.9 million  from 2012-2015), taking into account a modest impact from the beginning of un-grandfathering.    2  Our international forecast for fewer net adds than prior year is due to a tough comparison against the  Australia/New Zealand launch. The ANZ growth spike in Q2 last year resulted in international Q2 net  adds more than doubling year over year (from 1.12 million to 2.37 million).  While ANZ is growing  steadily this Q2, it is less than the launch spike last year. Ex-ANZ, international net adds would be  forecast up this quarter. International net adds are down sequentially both due to standard seasonality  and our launch in 130 countries at very beginning of Q1 (so Q1 captured the initial surge of sign-ups).     In the US, we are forecasting flat Y/Y  contribution margin in Q2, due to a large slate of content releases  and associated marketing. We expect strong y/y margin growth to resume in Q3 and we remain on track  to achieve our 40% US contribution margin target by 2020.     We expect Q2 international contribution loss to improve sequentially primarily due to recent favorable  currency movements. We anticipate that international contribution losses in the second half of 2016 will  be similar to the first half, as ongoing investments offset improved profitability in our more mature  markets.    On China, we are continuing discussions but have no material update on our approach or timing.  Whatever we do will have only a modest financial effect in the near term.     With respect to un-grandfathering, currently, more than half of our US members pay only $7.99 or $8.99  for our $9.99 HD 2-screen plan. We will phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of  2016, with our longest-tenured members getting the longest benefit. To reinforce brand trust, we won’t  change anyone’s price without their acknowledgement of the new price in their member experience,  where they will see a dialogue box about their options. Members can choose our $7.99 SD 1-screen  plan, our $9.99 HD 2-screen plan or our $11.99 UHD 4-screen plan. We are rolling this out slowly over  the year, rather than mostly in May, so we can learn as we go. Most of our grandfathered members are  in the US,  but we’ll take the same approach internationally.     We expect only modestly increased churn from un-grandfathering, partially because these members  have been with us for a reasonable period already, and because our content continues to improve. The  increase in ARPU will allow us to invest more in content next year, and we are taking up our expected  spend from about $5B in 2016 to over $6B on a P&L basis in 2017 (more on a cash basis).   Content\\xa0 In Q1, we had our most ambitious slate of content releases to date. Since the February 19th premiere of  Judd Apatow\\'s \\u200bLove\\u200b, we have debuted at least one new show or feature film every single week of the  quarter. This includes five new seasons of original series as well as several original feature films,  documentaries, kids shows and stand-up specials. We launched the second season of \\u200bMarvel’s Daredevil  and the fourth season of \\u200bHouse of Cards\\u200b to strong \\u200bcritical reviews\\u200b.      In addition to stepping up the pace, we’re also broadening our programming to appeal to a large global  membership base with diverse tastes.  We expanded into the multi-camera sitcom format in Q1 with  Fuller House\\u200b, a family comedy that met with overwhelmingly \\u200bpositive viewer reception\\u200b. \\u200bFuller House\\u200b,  3  and the late Q4 release of true crime documentary \\u200bMaking a Murderer\\u200b, are excellent examples of how  Netflix is breaking through the cultural zeitgeist and how our portfolio of original content continues to  be a great driver of membership growth for Netflix.     We are maintaining a fast pace of content launches in Q2, starting with the recently released sitcom \\u200bThe  Ranch\\u200b, starring Ashton Kutcher.  We’ll launch seven new seasons of original series, including  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\\u200b, \\u200bBloodline\\u200b, \\u200bGrace and Frankie\\u200b and \\u200bOrange is the New Black\\u200b. We will also  premiere the original films \\u200bThe Do-Over\\u200b, Adam Sandler’s second film for Netflix, \\u200bSpecial Correspondents  featuring Ricky Gervais and Eric Bana, \\u200bThe Fundamentals of Caring\\u200b, starring Paul Rudd and \\u200bBrahman  Naman \\u200bfrom the maverick Indian director Q.     Q2 will also mark our initial foray into the talk show genre with \\u200bChelsea\\u200b, starring Chelsea Handler. This  talk show will be a bit of a departure from the normal “all episodes at once” model of our other  originals. \\u200bChelsea \\u200bwill premiere new episodes nightly, three nights per week, shortly after the show is  recorded in front of a live audience and will incorporate stylistic elements from her well-received Netflix  documentary series\\u200b \\u200bChelsea Does\\u200b. \\u200b We are excited to bring Chelsea Handler and this new show to our  global platform that opens up our original content offering to include more topical programming that  merges our already successful comedy and documentary efforts.    Our investment in original content for kids and families has helped make Netflix a destination for great  creators of live action and animated television. Our original series were nominated for 33 Daytime  Emmy nominations across 7 of our original shows, including \\u200bAll Hail King Julien\\u200b,  \\u200bProject MC2\\u200b and  Dragons: Race to The Edge\\u200b. In Q2, we are releasing nine new seasons of original series for kids including  Kong: King of The Apes\\u200b and a re-boot of \\u200bVoltron\\u200b.     With our footprint now virtually global, Netflix is uniquely positioned to bring stories from all over the  world to people all over the world. We’ve stepped up production of non-English language series  following up on last year’s success of \\u200bClub de Cuervos\\u200b from Mexico and \\u200bNarcos\\u200b, which was filmed in  Colombia in Spanish and English.  Our first French series \\u200bMarseille\\u200b, a political drama starring Gerard  Depardieu, premieres globally on May 5, while our new Japanese original series \\u200bHibana\\u200b \\u200bpremieres  globally in June. We are also working on \\u200b3%\\u200b in Brazil,  \\u200bSuburra\\u200b \\u200bin Italy, \\u200bDark\\u200b in Germany, an  as-yet-untitled period series in Spain, a second season of \\u200bClub De Cuervos\\u200b \\u200band our second Mexican  original series, \\u200bIngobernable, \\u200bstarring Kate Del Castillo in Mexico,\\u200b \\u200bas well as our first fully global original  Japanese anime series \\u200bPerfect Bones\\u200b.\\u200b These series help both to cement the popularity and relevance of  Netflix in the territories where they originate and, in success, will reach a broad global audience.     We are investing about 5% of our cash content budget in original films. As we learn, we may spend  beyond that, once we’ve established that new, fully-exclusive movies debuting on Netflix creates more  consumer excitement and member viewing than the territory-by-territory licensing of nine-month-old  “Pay One” movies that are also available on TVOD and DVD. Upcoming original films in the second half  of 2016 include \\u200bWar Machine\\u200b, a satirical comedy starring Brad Pitt and directed by David Michod, and  Mascots,\\u200b the latest ensemble comedy from Christopher Guest\\u200b.\\u200b Our 2017 lineup includes Bong Joon-Ho’s  Okja\\u200b, and \\u200bBright\\u200b, an epic action film starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer.  4    The release schedule for our announced upcoming original content can be found on our \\u200bPR site\\u200b.     To highlight the expansion of our original content offering, we recently hosted an event in Paris for press  and influencers from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Below is a photo of Kevin Spacey and  Ted Sarandos, surrounded by our titles, before a large audience.        Product\\xa0 At Netflix, we strive to deliver the best video experience for our members and picture quality is an  important element of this. In 2014, we began streaming in 4K with the debut of \\u200bHouse of Cards\\u200b Season  2. Today, we have one of the largest catalogues of 4K content available, with the number of 4K titles  increasing 10x since inception. Not surprisingly, streaming of 4K content is growing as a share of total  viewing.     We are also continuing to push the boundaries of visual impact and we\\'re excited about High Dynamic  Range (HDR). While 4K offers more pixels, HDR provides greater depth with brighter highlights and a  wider color range. Today, you can experience HDR on Netflix with Season One of \\u200bMarco Polo\\u200b, if you have  an HDR-enabled TV and subscribe to our 4-screen UHD plan. We are expanding our HDR content  catalogue rapidly.    It wasn\\'t too long ago that online video was associated with grainy images and constant buffering. But  today, the Internet, not cable or broadcast distribution, is actually home to the cutting edge of video  quality and it will only get better from here as Internet TV replaces linear television.  5    We started rolling out new and more efficient encodes during Q1, offering either 20% savings in data, or  a commensurate increase in quality, depending on whether a consumer is bandwidth-limited or not.  This will be reflected in our ISP speed index reports as a small reduction in average bitrate across all ISPs,  but most of the value is realized in improved quality for our customers.  We are now turning our  attention to mobile-specific encodes, with a desire to deliver better video at lower bandwidth to these  devices, which are increasingly important in our newest markets.  Partnerships\\xa0 Similar to our content portfolio, our partnerships have expanded in scope over the years, growing in  importance with the launch of our service across the world. Originally focused on consumer electronics  device integration, Netflix partnerships now span a wide array of relationships with pay TV and mobile  operators, Internet service providers, mobile device and set top box manufacturers, and brick and  mortar retailers (gift cards).     We integrate Netflix to make it easier for members to sign up, access and pay for the service. In  addition, our partners benefit through customer acquisition, the opportunity to upsell higher value  packages of speed/data/content, lower churn and increases in brand affinity. Recently, Canadian  operator Telus said:    \"Nearly half of Optik TV customers are also Netflix subscribers. Making Netflix available was a  simple but powerful innovation to make our customers’ entertainment experience better, and far  easier. Not only has this driven deeper engagement with our Optik customers who have Netflix,  these same customers are actually consuming more content on Optik, including more on demand  content, than ever before.”     As Internet TV grows, it is exciting to be a part of a vibrant ecosystem driving innovation and value for  consumers all over the world.   Competition\\xa0 If you think about your last 30 days, and analyze the evenings you did not watch Netflix, you can  understand how broad our competition really is. Whether you played video games, surfed the web,  watched a DVD, TVOD, or linear TV, wandered through YouTube, read a book, streamed Hulu or  Amazon, or pirated content (hopefully not), you can see the market for relaxation time and disposable  income is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea.  For example, while we’ve grown from zero to  47 million members in the USA, HBO has also grown, which shows how large the entertainment market  is.  We earn a tiny fraction of consumers’ time and money, and have lots of opportunity ahead to win  more of your evenings away from all those other activities if we can keep improving.         6  Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure\\xa0 At the end of Q1, we had cash and equivalents totaling $2.1 billion. In Q1, free cash flow was -$261  million, compared with -$276 million in Q4 ‘15. As we have written in the past, our investment in original  programming (particularly owned content) is more cash intensive upfront, resulting in a timing-driven  gap between net income and free cash flow. We currently have $2.4 billion of long term debt. With our  low debt to enterprise value of 5%, our plan is to raise additional capital through the high yield market  later in 2016 or in early 2017.  Given the attractiveness of our business model in a growth area relative  to other large cap companies, as well as our low debt to EV ratio, investors view our bonds as quite  secure; they \\u200btrade\\u200b better than the BB index, despite our single B credit rating, (but not yet as well as  media firms like \\u200bViacom\\u200b or \\u200bDiscovery\\u200b). Over time, the ratings agencies may catch up to the buyside in  their views of the credit risk for Netflix.   DVD\\xa0 Our DVD service ended Q1 with 4.7M members and $72M in contribution profit.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  7  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.  However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding investments in international markets; localization of our  service; expansion to China and the financial impact of such expansion; end of grandfathered pricing and  its impact on churn and ARPU; price change process; content spending; future content offerings; original  content strategy; product developments such as HDR content and encode efficiency improvements;  future capital raises and timing of such raises; member growth domestically and internationally,  including net, total and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both  domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income,  net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer  usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,  competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and  events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers.  Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on  risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

       " 'Q117ShareholderLetterV2FINAL': \"Fellow shareholders,    In Q1, we surpassed $2.5 billion in quarterly streaming revenue and added 5 million members.  The  opportunity provided to us by the growth of the global internet is gigantic and our plan is to keep  investing as we increase membership, revenue and operating margins.           1  Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast   The quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report, and we strive for  accuracy. In Q1, there were no substantial variations from our January guidance forecast.   Due to content (primarily \\u200bHouse of Cards \\u200bseason 5) moving from Q1 to Q2, we had higher operating  margins in Q1 (as forecasted) at 9.7% than our plan for the year (about 7%).  We forecast operating  margin at 4.4% in Q2, placing us on track to reach our 7% target for the full year.   The other effect of the content moves is lower net adds in Q1 compared to prior year (as expected) and  heavier net adds in Q2 compared to prior year (about double).  We have come to see these quarterly  variances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV. For the first half of  this year, for example, we expect to have 8.15 million net adds, compared to 8.42 million net adds in the  first half last year.   International net additions decreased 22% year over year, as we lapped our January 2016 launch of over  130 countries, and the accompanying early surge demand, in Q1 2016. Revenue for the international  segment grew 62% year over year, excluding a -$12 million impact from currency, while ASP rose 12%  year over year on a F/X neutral basis. Q1 was the first quarter of consolidated profit for our international  segment as profit growth in our more mature territories offset investments in newer markets.  Our  forward guidance shows that we intend to continue to invest internationally, projecting a small loss for  Q2.  We have high satisfaction and are rapidly growing in Latin America, Europe, and North America. We are  making good strides in improving our content offering to match local tastes in Asia, Middle East, and  Africa, but have much progress to make, like in Latin America a few years ago.   Our year-over-year streaming revenue growth is benefiting from a price change in mid 2016, and will  moderate over the course of the year to track membership growth more closely. We are seeing a small  but steady migration to our 4-stream, 4K-UHD-HDR video quality tier, which is our high end plan. That  will keep revenue growth slightly above membership growth, holding F/X constant.   For the last several years we’ve had flat operating margins due to established markets funding  international expansion with every spare dollar we had. Because of that, the major indicators of our  progress were member and revenue growth and US contribution margins. Starting this year, we can be  primarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics. The  summary table above has been reorganized to reflect that, while maintaining comparability to the past.   Content  With a growing member base spread across the world, we seek to please diverse tastes with a wide  breadth of content. The key releases this past quarter highlight this range of programming: \\u200bA Series of  Unfortunate Events\\u200b, a dark comedy for the entire family, \\u200bSanta Clarita Diet\\u200b, a “zom-com” starring Drew  Barrymore and \\u200bUltimate Beastmaster\\u200b, our first competition show which pits athletes from around the  globe against a fearsome 600-foot obstacle course.  2  In addition to these titles, on March 17, we debuted \\u200bMarvel’s Iron Fist\\u200b, which has quickly become  another highly viewed Marvel series, and sets the stage for \\u200bThe Defenders\\u200b, which brings together all the  characters from the Marvel series later this year. A week later, we launched \\u200bIngobernable\\u200b, our second  Mexican series, starring Kate del Castillo, which has been very popular in Mexico. On the last day of Q1,  we unveiled \\u200b13 Reasons Why\\u200b. Below is global search volume for several of our big launches over the last  year.      We have also stepped up our investment in stand up comedy which we believe can help grow our  business, like our original series. Early results are promising; the triumphant return of a comedy legend  in \\u200bDave Chappelle: Collection 1\\u200b was our most viewed comedy special ever. We are also finding this to be  true in international markets as well, with comedian Gad Elmaleh’s \\u200bGad Gone Wild\\u200b, a breakout hit in  France last quarter.  Just ahead of the release of our third film from Adam Sandler, \\u200bSandy Wexler\\u200b, we announced the renewal  of our deal with Sandler to premiere an additional four films exclusively on Netflix around the world. We  continue to be excited by our Sandler relationship and our members continue to be thrilled with his  films. Since the launch of \\u200bThe Ridiculous 6\\u200b, Netflix members have spent more than half a billion hours  enjoying the films of Adam Sandler.   We recently hired \\u200bScott Stuber\\u200b to lead our original films initiative. Our goal remains the same: to offer a  variety of new movies that will attract and delight members at better economics relative to licensing  movies under traditional windowing. Some of our early movies have been successful by this measure,  such as the Sandler movies and \\u200bSiege of Jadotville\\u200b. Others, such as \\u200bCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon:  Sword of Destiny\\u200b, have not.  Scott’s mandate is to increase both the portfolio and the percentage of  films that delight many of our members relative to the film’s cost.   3  Since our members are funding these films, they should be the first to see them. But we are also open to  supporting the large theater chains, such as AMC and Regal in the US, if they want to offer our films,  such as our upcoming Will Smith film \\u200bBright\\u200b, in theatres simultaneous to Netflix. Let consumers choose.   Product  As always, our product team has dozens of tests running in the endless quest for even higher member  satisfaction. One test that won conclusively last year and has now been rolled out to all members is our  new “thumbs-up thumbs-down” feedback model, replacing the 5-star model we have had from our DVD  days. The amount of usage we get with this new approach is over twice as many ratings.  With this  additional personal input, we’ll be able to improve personalization, making your front screen on Netflix  even more relevant.   A multi-year effort ahead is to have video replace still images in our user experience in ways that please  our members and help them choose what to watch. Video for choosing video is an obvious direction, but  doing it well through our interface takes judgment, creativity, and testing.  In April, we will add Thai and later in the quarter, Romanian and Hebrew, to the 24 languages we  currently support.   Marketing  As our slate of content expands, we’ll spend over $1 billion in 2017 marketing our content to drive  member acquisition. As part of this, we are investing more in programmatic advertising with the aim of  improving our ability to do individualized marketing at scale and to deliver the right ad to the right  person at the right time. Buttressing this activity is the substantial earned media coverage around the  Netflix brand, technology and content we generate globally through events and activities aimed at  journalists and social media influencers. We also market our content extensively to members through  our service and with our partners. For instance, we participated in Comcast’s Watchathon in April,  providing X1 subscribers unlimited access to Netflix for a week.   Competition  Our investors often ask us about ecosystem change, such as the advent in the US of virtual MVPDs (like  Sling, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, YouTube TV and Hulu’s forthcoming service). We believe VMVPDs  will likely be more directly competitive to existing MVPD services since they offer a subset of the same  channels at $30-$60 per month, and may appeal to a segment of the population that doesn’t subscribe  to a pay TV bundle. But we don’t think it will have much of an impact on us as Netflix is largely  complementary to pay TV packages. Our focus also is on on-demand, commercial free viewing rather  than live, ad-supported programming.   Additionally, investors ask us about Amazon’s move into NFL football.  That is not a strategy that we  think is smart for us since we believe we can earn more viewing and satisfaction from spending that  money on movies and TV shows.   4  Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow in Q1’17 was -$423 million vs. -$261 million in the year ago quarter and an improvement  from -$639 million in Q4’16. The growth in our original content means we continue to plan to have  around $2B in negative FCF this year.   We have a large market opportunity ahead of us and we’re optimizing long-term FCF by growing our  original content aggressively. Negative near-term FCF is the result of the big increases in our original  content, combined with small but growing operating margins. Since we want our operating margins to  grow slowly so we can spend enough to quickly grow revenue and original content, we anticipate  negative FCF to accompany our rapid growth for many years. Our operating margins are our key  indicator of improving global profitability; they are already growing and we plan to keep them growing  for many years ahead. Eventually, at a much larger revenue base, original content and revenue growth  will be slower, and we anticipate substantial positive FCF, like our media peers.  Our debt to total cap ratio, at under 10%, is quite conservative compared to most of our media peers at  30-70%, and conservative compared to efficient capital structure theory. Thus we will continue to add  long-term debt as needed to finance our expansion of original content, including in Q2’17.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding the company’s business opportunity, balancing  contribution profit and investment in the service, localization efforts, operating margins, plans to invest  in growth; product initiatives; marketing spend; impacts on our business from competition; localization  efforts; content strategy, including local content, original and licensed content investments; use of  capital; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue;  contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income,  earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should  anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Q4'14 Net Income/EPS includes a $39m / $0.63 benefit from a tax accrual release related to                      2    Q1 Results and Q2 Forecast  We added a record 4.9 million new members globally in Q1, against our forecast of 4.1 million and prior  year of 4.0 million, bringing our total global streaming membership to 62.3 million. In the US, we gained  2.3 million new members, well above our expectation of 1.8 million due to both acquiring and retaining  more members than forecast.  Internationally, we added 2.6 million members versus a forecast of 2.25  million due to stronger growth than expected across a number of markets.   As a reminder, the quarterly  guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.   We think strong US growth benefited from our ever-improving content, including the launch of the third  season of House of Cards and new shows Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Bloodline.  In addition,  retention continued to improve due to the growing value of our service overall.  We are forecasting Q2  US net adds of 0.6 million, similar to the year ago quarter.  During Q1, higher-than-forecast net adds and US revenue, coupled with lower-than-forecast content  spending, resulted in a US contribution margin of 31.7%, ahead of our 30.1% estimate.  In 2015, we  expect to run ahead of our US contribution margin growth target of 200 bps/year on average because a  greater share of global and original content costs will be absorbed by existing and new international  territories as we continue to expand globally (since we allocate global content costs by geography).    In addition, starting in Q2 we intend to shift some of our US marketing budget to international to take  advantage of the substantial available growth opportunities. This, in the short term, drives down  international contribution profits and drives up US contribution profits.  We are still targeting 40%  contribution margin in the US in 2020.  Our international segment was fueled by continued strong growth across our 50+ countries as well as a  successful March 24 launch in Australia and New Zealand, which adds about 8 million1 broadband  households to our addressable market.  In ANZ, Netflix benefited from high consumer awareness, a  fervent fan base for original series like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and operator  relationships with Optus and iiNet, the second and third largest broadband providers.  We expect  international Q2 net adds of 1.90 million, up 70% vs. last year. Later in 2015, we will launch additional  markets, starting with Japan.   The strong dollar hurt financial results during the quarter, negatively affecting International segment  revenue (lower by $48 million y/y using Q1 2014 forex rates) which carried through into a $15M  negative forex impact on international contribution loss.  These forex headwinds offset better than  expected subscriber growth to result in contribution losses close to our expectations.  As a reminder, we  absorbed on average 5% higher VAT rates across our European markets starting January 1.  We’ll have a  full quarter of content expenses in ANZ in Q2 and expect the international segment loss to grow to $101  million, increasing throughout the back half of 2015 as we expand to additional markets (consistent with  what we’ve said).  Our strong performance led to overall operating income that exceeded our projections ($97m actual  versus $79m forecast). Net income was negatively affected by currency-related transaction losses                                                              1 SNL Kagan                      3  included in other expense; excluding these forex losses, Q1 EPS would have been $0.77 vs. our $0.60  forecast and our actual EPS of $0.38.  Content  Our original content strategy is playing out as we hoped, driving lots of viewing in an economic way for  Netflix while bolstering the positive perception of our brand and service around the world.  House of Cards, in its third season, had its biggest launch yet in terms of viewers. Unbreakable Kimmy  Schmidt, Tina Fey’s return to television, has been a hit, winning Rotten Tomatoes scores of 90%+ from  both critics and viewers and our drama thriller, Bloodline starring Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn and  Sissy Spacek, is performing on par with the first seasons of our other big drama shows. During the  quarter, we announced new seasons for all three shows, as well as three new Netflix original films, Pee- Wee’s Big Holiday from Judd Apatow and Paul Reubens, Jadotville, from Irish director Richie Smyth and  starring Jamie Dornan, and Beasts of No Nation from director Cary Fukunaga and starring Idris Elba.  Beasts will premiere on Netflix later this year.   We are delighted by the fan excitement and critical response around last Friday’s launch of Marvel’s  Daredevil, the first of four series and a mini-series from our deal with Marvel Entertainment. The current  quarter will also see the debut of Grace and Frankie starring legendary comedians Jane Fonda and Lily  Tomlin, Sense8, an unbelievably cinematic and entertaining global dramatic thriller from the Wachowski  siblings, and the third season of our groundbreaking Orange is The New Black. To track our future  originals slate, click here.  Marketing  We are increasingly spending on the promotion of our original content rather than emphasizing  attributes of the Netflix brand and service that are now more familiar to consumers. Early tests in  international markets suggest this content focus is aiding member acquisition.  We are also spending a bigger proportion of our marketing dollars online. This allows us to more finely  target audiences and to deliver the right marketing message to the right person at the right time,  particularly on mobile devices.  Product  We plan to roll out an improvement to our TV UI in the second half of 2015. The enhancement will bring  video playback forward into the browse experience. We are also developing improved ways to promote  Netflix originals to our members, using our data to help identify which members would be most likely to  enjoy each original title. Given our international rollout, we continue to add subtitles and UI languages  for much of our content.   Over the next year we’ll evolve from using HTTP to using Secure HTTP (HTTPS) while browsing and  viewing content on our service.   This helps protect member privacy, particularly when the network is  insecure, such as public wifi, and it helps protect members from eavesdropping by their ISP or employer,  who may want to record our members’ viewing for other reasons.                        4  Strong Net Neutrality  We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access  they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at  interconnection points. In the US, we have been vocal advocates for, and are pleased with, recent action  by the FCC to assure an open and neutral Internet under its Title II authority.  In particular, we applaud  the FCC for specifically addressing interconnection points. We hope this action serves as an example to  regulators around the world looking to strengthen the innovative force of the Internet.  Data caps inhibit Internet innovation and are bad for consumers. In Australia, we recently sought to  protect our new members from data caps by participating in ISP programs that, while common in  Australia, effectively condone discrimination among video services (some capped, some not). We should  have avoided that and will avoid it going forward. Fortunately, most fixed-line ISPs are raising or  eliminating data caps in line with our belief that ISPs should provide great video for all services in a  market and let consumers do the choosing.  Competition  In the US, HBO began offering its $15 per month “HBO Now” service last week. As we have said in the  past, Netflix and HBO are not substitutes for one another given differing content. We think both will  continue to be successful in the marketplace, as illustrated by the fact that HBO has continued to grow  globally and domestically as we have rapidly grown over the past 5 years.    We view “Internet MVPD” offerings like the rumored Apple offering, Sony’s Playstation Vue and Dish’s  Sling TV as more competitive to the current pay TV bundle than to Netflix which is lower cost, has  exclusive and original content, and is not focused on live television.  Piracy remains a considerable long-term threat, mostly outside the US.  DVD  Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to delight more than 5.5 million members and provided  $85 million in contribution profit in Q1.  The broad selection of titles, including new release movies and  TV shows, remains appealing to a core user base and means that the tail on this business should be  quite long.  Free Cash Flow & Capital  During the quarter, free cash flow totaled -$163 million, a step up from Q4 reflecting our growing  original content investment.  In February, we issued $1.5 billion in debt at a weighted average interest  rate of 5.7%, split between 7 and 10 year notes. We ended Q1 with $3.0 billion in cash & equivalents  and short term investments. We will continue to invest aggressively in original content which is cash  intensive.   As we’ve said, our plan is to run around break-even globally through 2016, and to then deliver material  global profits in 2017 and beyond.      5  Stock Split  As highlighted in our preliminary proxy, we are seeking shareholder approval for an increase in our  authorized shares. If approved, we expect to recommend to our Board a stock split to make our stock  more accessible.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: January 2015, October 2014, July 2014,  April 2014, January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013.  Summary  We are excited to see Internet TV catch hold across the world. We are at one of those wonderful  moments when technology intersects with storytelling to create more choice and value for consumers.  It’s great to be at the vanguard and we appreciate your support.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis  excluding foreign currency and the release of tax reserves provides useful information as these  measures exclude effects that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes  that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the  amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain  other activities.  However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a  substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash  provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on  the attached unaudited financial statements.   Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding US contribution margin growth; international expansion,  deployment of marketing funds; content launches; product improvements; agreements with ISPs;  impact of competition; stock split; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total  and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and  DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per  share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on January 29, 2015.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should  anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and                      7  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to  update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                                  8 Netflix, Inc.

       " 'Q2-19-Shareholder-Letter-FINAL': \"Fellow shareholders,  As expected, revenue growth accelerated 400 basis points to 26%, and operating income increased 53%  year over year in Q2. Paid membership grew by 2.7m, less than the 5.5m in Q2 a year ago and our 5.0m  forecast. In Q3, we expect to grow by 7m paid memberships, more than the 6.1m in Q3 a year ago.  Consumers around the world continue to move from linear television to internet entertainment at a  remarkable rate.     Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast  Average streaming paid memberships increased 24% year over year, while ARPU increased 3% year over  year on a reported basis. Excluding the year over year foreign exchange (F/X) impact on revenue of  -$265 million, global streaming ARPU grew 9%, with 12% and 7% ARPU growth in the US and  international segments, respectively. Operating margin of 14.3% (up 250 bps year over year) was higher  than our beginning-of-quarter forecast as some marketing spend was shifted into the second half of the  year. EPS amounted to $0.60 vs. $0.85 and included a $61 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X  remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt. Streaming content obligations decreased 2%  sequentially, reflecting our shift to more owned (vs. licensed) content.  1  As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.  We strive for accuracy (not conservatism), which means that in some quarters we will be high and other  quarters low relative to our guidance. In Q2’19, our membership growth forecast was high.     Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases. We don’t  believe competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape  during Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our  over-forecast was in every region). Rather, we think Q2’s content slate drove less growth in paid net  adds than we anticipated. Additionally, Q1 was so large for us (9.6m net adds), there may have been  more pull-forward effect than we realized. In prior quarters with over-forecasts, we’ve found that the  underlying long-term growth was not affected and staying focused on the fundamentals of our business  served us well.   Q3 has started with \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b season 3, and the first two weeks of Q3 are strong. In addition to  the recently released season 3 of \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b, our second half content slate includes new seasons of  La Casa de Papel\\u200b (\\u200bMoney Heist\\u200b), \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b, and the final season of the iconic \\u200bOrange is the New Black\\u200b as  well as big films like \\u200bThe Irishman\\u200b from Martin Scorsese and action movie \\u200b6 Underground\\u200b (directed by  Michael Bay and starring Ryan Reynolds).   While our US paid membership was essentially flat in Q2, we expect it to return to more typical growth  in Q3, and are seeing that in these early weeks of Q3. We forecast Q3 global paid net adds of 7.0m, up  vs. 6.1m in Q3’18, with 0.8m in the US and 6.2m internationally. Our internal forecast still currently calls  for annual global paid net adds to be up year over year. There’s no change to our 13% operating margin  target for FY19, up 300 basis points year over year.   2    Content  Our Q2 content slate featured several highly watched titles. We launched \\u200bDead to Me\\u200b, a dramedy  starring 2019 Emmy nominated Best Actress Christina Applegate, which was watched by 30m  households in its first four weeks. We’ve renewed this half hour comedy for a second season. We’re also  proud of \\u200bWhen They See Us\\u200b, a moving limited series based on the Central Park Five case, from Ava  DuVernay. This powerful story was watched by 25m households in its first four weeks and has stirred a  global conversation about race, identity, and criminal justice. \\u200bWhen They See Us\\u200b was also just nominated  for 16 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Limited Series. \\u200bOur Planet\\u200b was our most ambitious  undertaking in the documentary category to date and it’s also our highest-watched original docu-series  through its first four weeks (33m households) and was just nominated for 10 Emmy Awards.  We are making good progress with our original films portfolio with more and more of our films creating  larger audiences than our pay 1 licensed movies. At the end of June, we premiered our latest Adam  Sandler movie \\u200bMurder Mystery\\u200b (also starring Jennifer Aniston), which is the most watched Adam Sandler  Netflix original film to date; over 73m households watched this film in its first four weeks. In Q2, the  young adult romantic comedy movie \\u200bThe Perfect Date\\u200b (featuring Noah Centineo from our big film \\u200bTo All  The Boys I’ve Loved Before\\u200b) was a global hit with 48m households in its first four weeks. Similarly, Ali  Wong co-starred with Randall Park in \\u200bAlways Be My Maybe \\u200b(directed by Nahnatchka Khan), which was  viewed by 32m households in its first four weeks.   Season 2 of \\u200bThe Rain\\u200b was among the largest returning seasons for one of our non-English language  originals, while Swedish series \\u200bQuicksand\\u200b was a new show that was highly watched both locally and  globally. We also debuted several local-language titles that were very popular in their home territories  like the first two installments of the \\u200bHistoria de un Crimen \\u200bfranchise (\\u200bHistoria de un Crimen: Colosio\\u200b and  3  Historia de un Crimen: Colmenares\\u200b) in Latin America, while \\u200bFamily Business\\u200b was a breakthrough hit for us  in France.   We’ve been moving our content from semi-exclusive catalog and 2nd-window unbranded content to  branded exclusive 1st window original content for many years. Much of our domestic, and eventually  global, Disney catalog, as well as \\u200bFriends\\u200b, \\u200bThe Office\\u200b, and some other licensed content will wind down  over the coming years, freeing up budget for more original content. We don’t have material viewing  concentration as even our largest titles (that are watched by millions of members) account for only a  low single digit percentage of streaming hours. From what we’ve seen in the past when we drop strong  catalog content (Starz and Epix with Sony, Disney, and Paramount films, or 2nd run series from Fox, for  example) our members shift over to enjoying our other great content.   Forty of our original series, films and specials were nominated for 117 Emmy Awards, including  Outstanding Comedy and Drama Series, Limited Series, Animated Series and Reality Series, as well as  Variety, Children’s, short form and interactive programs. We are incredibly proud to offer best in class  original programming in so many different forms.  Marketing  As Netflix has shifted to original content, our marketing has evolved to increasingly focus on launching  our key titles to build excitement amongst existing and non-members. We’re continuing to invest in  owned and earned media, where we can have strong, direct relationships with fans. We’re very excited  to welcome \\u200bJackie Lee-Joe\\u200b as our new CMO to help us take our marketing to the next level.   We’re also building out our licensing and brand partnerships effort, which is optimizing for fan and  viewer engagement over revenue maximization. For example, for the launch of \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b season  3, we partnered with best-in-class brands like \\u200bCoke\\u200b, \\u200bNike\\u200b, \\u200bBurger King\\u200b, and \\u200bBaskin Robbins\\u200b to build deep  connections with our fans.  At E3, the largest video gaming event of the year, we announced a new \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b mobile game, a  game based on our upcoming new show \\u200bDark Crystal: Age of Resistance \\u200b(a prequel to the 1982 film),  and a partnership with Epic Games, the developers of \\u200bFortnite\\u200b. Like our other merchandising initiatives,  these games are designed to build fandom for our titles and don’t signal a push into gaming as a new  business for Netflix.   Product and Partnerships  We recently entered into a new partnership with AT&T in the US to integrate Netflix into their new  set-top box. In the US, we now partner with a wide range of ISPs and MVPDs, including Comcast, DISH,  Verizon, T-Mobile, Charter, and Altice, in addition to AT&T.  After several months of testing, we’ve decided to roll out a lower-priced mobile-screen plan in India to  complement our existing plans. We believe this plan, which will launch in Q3, will be an effective way to  introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market  where Pay TV ARPU is low (below $5). We will continue to learn more after launch of this plan.   4  Competition  Over the next 12 months, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, NBCU and others are joining Hulu, Amazon, BBC,  Hotstar, YouTube, Netflix, and many others in offering streaming entertainment. The competition for  winning consumers’ relaxation time is fierce for all companies and great for consumers. The innovation  of streaming services is also drawing consumers to shift more and more from linear television to  streaming entertainment. If you watch \\u200bOur Planet\\u200b on a new TV with Dolby Vision or HDR10, you will see  why: the quality of streaming television is spectacular. In the US, our most developed market, we still  only earn about 10% of consumers’ television time, and less of their mobile screen time, so we have  much room for growth.  We, like HBO, are advertising free. That remains a deep part of our brand proposition; when you read  speculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be confident that this is false. We believe we will  have a more valuable business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue and instead  entirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction.   Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Net cash used in operating activities in Q2’19 was -$544 million vs. -$518 million in the prior year period.  Free cash flow (FCF)  totaled -$594 million vs. -$559 million in Q2’18. We’re still forecasting FCF of  1 approximately -$3.5 billion for the full year 2019 and expect improvement in 2020. From there, we’ll  continue to reduce our free cash flow deficit as we intend to continue growing our member base,  revenues, and operating margin, which provides a clear path towards positive FCF. In the meantime, our  plan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments as we did in April. In our most recent  round, we raised 10.5 year senior notes of €1.2 billion (3.875% coupon) and $900 million (5.375%  coupon).

Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  6  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.

       " 'Q213-Investor-Letter': '1  July 22, 2013          Dear Fellow Shareholders,    We have grown to nearly 30 million domestic members and 8 million international members.  Q2  streaming revenue was up 26% domestically and 155% internationally over prior year.     Our first set of Netflix Originals earned 14 Emmy Award nominations, including “House of Cards” for  Outstanding Drama Series.  This is the first time an Internet TV show has been nominated for top Emmy  awards.    We invite you to watch our live video interview at youtube.com/netflixir at 3pm Pacific today.  Summary Q2 Results & Q3 Guidance Midpoints                               2  Domestic Streaming  As the table above shows, we are generating steady growth in members, revenue, and contribution  profit.  Our content mix, streaming and user experiences are all getting better and devices and  bandwidth are improving. Countering this, competitors for consumer attention are also all improving,  and the risk of U.S. market saturation only grows as we do.  Given these competing forces, we are very  happy this year to be tracking slightly ahead of prior year in terms of net additions.     We generally expect net additions in Q2 to be lower than prior year Q2 due to increased net-add  seasonality as we grow.  This Q2, however, was an exception, we believe due to the launch of Arrested  Development.  This show already had a strong brand and fan base, generating a small but noticeable  bump in membership when we released it.  Other great shows don’t have that noticeable effect in their  first season because they are less established.   Our contribution margin has now grown faster than our target for several quarters (up 610 basis points  from Q2 2012 on a target of 400).  In addition to growing members at a faster rate than expected, our  outperformance is due to timing shifts on content deals and to a lesser degree just spending less on  content than expected.  We are growing domestic content spend significantly and plan to continue to do  so.  We’ve generally talked about how we’re focused on 100 bps of sequential quarterly expansion, and  how the lumpiness of content deals can make the q/q pattern somewhat irregular.  Going forward, we’ll  slightly modify the articulation of our target from “an average of 100 bps per quarter” to “400 bps per  year.”    In Q3, our guidance midpoint implies 130 bps of further margin expansion as we continue to run above  our target.  For Q4, we anticipate stepping up content spending even more, getting us closer to our 400  bps per year target.  We’ll keep targeting about 400 basis points of annual improvement into 2014 if we  keep growing net additions at 2012/2013 levels.    In the quarter, we allowed our broad content deal with MTV Networks to expire.  As we have said in the  past, it is our preference to license specific shows that our members love in an exclusive manner. While  the shows from Nickelodeon and Comedy Central came off our service, we introduced several new  shows from Disney Jr., The Cartoon Network and the HUB for kids, and great comedies like “The New  Girl” from Fox on July 1.  Viewing and retention remain strong.    TV Everywhere continues to steadily improve, with, for example, the HBO Go app now available on  AppleTV.    Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant Video continue to license some exclusive content and develop their own  Originals.  We have House of Cards and many others; Hulu has Battleground; and Amazon Prime Instant  Video will have Alpha House; all are quite good and quite different.  All three services are becoming  more distinct from one another, like HBO, Showtime and Starz are distinct from one another on linear  TV.  Of our “top 200” titles, Hulu is now at 36 titles and Amazon Prime Instant Video is at 68.  Now that  Hulu has more money to spend, content prices may rise further, but we have many multi-year deals in                        3  place to mitigate this.  Hulu and Amazon appear to have about the same amount of viewing, and Hulu  recently reported 4 million paying members.     International Streaming  Our International streaming segment saw membership growth in all markets.  Net additions a year ago  were boosted by our UK/Ireland launch, so we are very happy to match in Q2 the net additions of a year  ago given we had no new territory launch in the first half of this year.  As our guidance implies, we  expect Q3 net additions to be above Q3 of last year, bolstered in part by the launch of Netflix  Netherlands within the quarter.    In Latin America, we continued to see strong growth of new members in Brazil after our April price  change from 15 BRL to 17 BRL.  Prices update in August for grandfathered members but we expect a  relatively small impact.  Most prices in Brazil are rising due to substantial inflation.    Q2 international contribution loss was lower than expected due to slightly higher member growth and  lower than anticipated growth in content spending across multiple markets.  We plan to grow our  international content investments in Q3 slightly ahead of revenues.  This growth combined with the  losses associated with the launch of the Netherlands results in our guidance reflecting a q/q increase in  our combined international contribution loss.  Netherlands is about half the size of Canada, and is a good opportunity for us as we prepare for entry  into more markets.  We’ll continue to expand in 2014 based upon the progression of our existing  markets and on confidence in the expansion opportunities.    Originals  For years we have featured a broad selection of movies and TV series licensed from others, and we  continue to improve the quality of this offering while seeking to differentiate Netflix by licensing that  content exclusively. This licensed content accounts for the bulk of viewing and leads to a lot of member  enjoyment.     Over the last six months, our move into Original programming has begun to redefine Netflix in the eyes  of consumers. Our first five series -- Lilyhammer, House of Cards, Hemlock Grove, Arrested Development  Season 4, and Orange is the New Black  -- have engaged large audiences across our markets and are very  different, allowing us to broaden our overall reach with each new Original.     We assess the success of each Original by looking at viewing-to-date and estimated future viewing,  relative to cost. So far, we’ve ordered second seasons of all first season projects, which is quite unusual  and exciting for the fans of these shows.  We’d be delighted to produce a fifth season of Arrested  Development, if possible, given fan reaction.                           4  We are thrilled to have the Netflix Originals nominated for 14 Emmys, with House of Cards earning nine  nominations including Outstanding Drama, Arrested Development garnering three, and Hemlock Grove  two. We couldn’t be more proud and pleased for the series creators, actors, composers, designers and  others who are being recognized by their peers for the excellence of their storytelling on Netflix.    Later this month, we will premiere Mako Mermaids, a series aimed at teen audiences, while for the  remainder of 2013 we will launch the Ricky Gervais series Derek and season two of Lilyhammer,  followed by Turbo: F.A.S.T.(Fast Action Stunt Team), our first animated Original from DreamWorks  Animation.  We’re excited about our plans for 2014 and beyond as we premiere season two of House of  Cards, Hemlock Grove, and Orange is the New Black, and debut Sense 8, and multiple kids Originals from  DreamWorks Animation.    Beyond series, we will be expanding our Originals initiative to include broadly appealing feature  documentaries and stand-up comedy specials. Netflix has become a big destination for fans of these  much loved and often under-distributed genres.    We’ll continue to build on our initial success with Originals as we gain confidence in our ability to use  our judgment and data to find projects that our members will enjoy.   Based on the viewing trends we see with other similar television series, we are amortizing Originals on a  straight-line basis over the shorter of 4 years or the license period1.  We are in the early stages of  Originals and continue to monitor whether the viewing pattern is enough higher in the first few months  to have us amortize at a faster initial rate, and then to continue on a straight-line basis for the  remainder of the amortization period.  In terms of relative size, of the approximately $3 billion in  content library net book value we are amortizing, currently around 5% is for Originals.    Streaming Service Getting Better  Our Product Innovation teams greatly enhanced the features and delivery of our service during the  quarter, as well as improved discovery and merchandising of our content library.    During Q2, we rolled out a new streaming player platform to all partners and began work towards a  single UI to run across multiple devices that will be optimized for various input devices (voice  interactions, pointer, and left/right/up/down controllers).  The new platform and UI are optimized for  better performance and faster starts and allow us to increase the number of platforms on which we can  conduct AB testing for even more rapid innovation.     In Q2, we also continued to focus efforts on improving our recommendation algorithms to help our  members discover great content.  Our recommendation algorithms create a highly personalized                                                              1If a subsequent season is added, we extend the remaining amortization period by a year.                        5  experience for each of our streaming members, allowing them to easily find content they’ll love and  allowing us to optimize the utility of the content library.  Constant innovation in this important area  (more than ¾ of the hours streamed on Netflix come from personalized suggestions generated by our  recommendation algorithms) continues across a variety of dimensions.      We continue improving features which will facilitate social interaction among members by allowing  them to provide direct recommendations to one another, provide feedback about those  recommendations and to share them with mutual friends.    In Q3, we’ll be rolling out our profiles features which will allow households to have distinct “profiles” for  different members or viewing tastes within their home, enabling us to provide a much more  personalized experience for our members.    Our default $7.99 plan includes two simultaneous streams.  We added an additional plan, at $11.99, that  includes 4 simultaneous streams for the few large families that would otherwise need two separate  accounts and partition their TVs between the two accounts.  As expected, the take rate on this large  family plan is minimal.  Our default limit of two simultaneous streams keeps password sharing with non- household members to a minimum because it risks the account owner not being able to watch when  they want.       Marketing    With our new Watch Responsibly ads, we’ve sought to tell a fun and emotional story that ties  consumers to the Netflix brand and highlight attributes of our service that drive certain consumer  behaviors - like watching ahead, spoiling it for others, and marathon viewing.  We didn’t invent these  behaviors, but they’ve become associated with Netflix and highlight the fundamental changes in the way  consumers are enjoying TV series and movies.     We’ve also begun to shine an even more effective light on the great content available on Netflix,  particularly our Originals.  Each Original has been backed by distinctive marketing and promotional  campaigns that have served to increase awareness of our service and to trigger engagement among  both members and non-members. The publicity surrounding Originals has been very substantial and  generally very positive, leading in turn to improved perception of the quality of content on our service  and on the value we offer to members.                            6  DVD  The huge selection we offer on DVD continues to be a draw for over 7 million households.  DVD contribution profit declined 19% y/y, in line with the decline in member/revenues, as most of the  costs scale with member/shipment levels.  We continue to anticipate being able to maintain approximately the margins we’ve posted in the first  half of 2013 throughout the full year.  Consistent with our view in prior quarters, we don’t foresee USPS  service changes that will have a material negative impact upon us or our members over the next few  quarters.      Free Cash Flow & Capital  Free cash flow was +$13 million in Q2, a swing to positive reflecting the relatively fewer content  payments in the quarter and strong global profit growth.  Our investments in content, including  Originals, will continue to weigh on FCF relative to net income and thus our FCF trends.    In April, we converted the 2011 TCV $200 million convertible notes to the corresponding 2.3 million  shares as discussed in our Q1 letter.  Our sole remaining long-term debt is the $500 million notes we  raised in February, which is due in 2021.       We continue to have just over a $1 billion in cash and equivalents.                                              7  Business Outlook  For investor convenience we placed the midpoints of our guidance ranges in the table at the beginning  of this letter.  This does not make the midpoint the “goal”.  Our best estimate is we will be within the  ranges below.  The ranges below are our guidance.         Summary     We are thrilled to be pleasing more members than ever.     The world is moving from linear TV to Internet TV and Netflix is leading that evolution.    Sincerely,                        8                                        Reed Hastings, CEO                         David Wells, CFO                                                           Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Interview  Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, Chief Financial Officer David Wells and Chief Content  Officer Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview about the Company’s financial results and  business outlook at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.      Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding meeting domestic contribution margin targets;  investments in content, particularly exclusive and original content; subscriber acquisition seasonality;  potential effects of competition and market saturation; international contribution margin and impacts  arising from expansion to the Netherlands; improvements to our service, including the rollout of profiles  and social features; content accounting for originals; business outlook for our DVD segment, including  contribution margins and the impact of USPS service changes; free cash flow and usage of cash; member  growth, including total and paid; revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming  and DVD) and international operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the third  quarter of 2013.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in  service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our  service; competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013.  We undertake no obligation to update  forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                         10 Netflix, Inc.

       " 'Q216LettertoShareholders_FINAL_w_Tables': \"Fellow shareholders,    We grew by 1.7m members in Q2 finishing with over 83 million members. This is below our forecast of  2.5m net new members and our prior year Q2 net additions of 3.3m. We are growing, but not as fast as  we would like or have been. Disrupting a big market can be bumpy, but the opportunity ahead is as big  as ever and we continue to improve every aspect of our business.           1  Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast  Our global member forecast for Q2 was 2.5m and we came in at 1.7m. Gross additions were on target,  but churn ticked up slightly and unexpectedly, coincident with the \\u200bpress coverage\\u200b in early April of our  plan to un-grandfather longer tenured members and remained elevated through the quarter.  We think  some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of  two years of grandfathering. Churn of members who were actually un-grandfathered is modest and  conforms to our expectations. With our large subscriber base, slight variances in retention versus  forecast can result in significant swings in net adds, particularly in a seasonally small net add quarter like  Q2.   While un-grandfathering and associated media coverage may moderate near-term membership growth,  we believe that un-grandfathering will provide us with more revenue to invest in our content to satisfy  members, thus driving long-term growth. Over the second half of this year, we’ll complete  un-grandfathering. Our three-tier pricing (in the US: $7.99 SD, $9.99 HD, and $11.99 UHD) is working  well for us and for new members, and our gross additions remain healthy.   On earnings, we slightly under-forecast the quarter, ending Q2 with operating income of $70 million and  net income of $41 million against a forecast of $47 million and $9 million with the variance largely due  to lower-than-expected content and other costs.   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report  and our goal is to be accurate, not conservative. Therefore, in some quarters, we may come in high  versus our forecast and, in other quarters, we may come in low.   In the US, our Q2 net additions were 0.16 million against a forecast of 0.50 million. US revenue rose 18%  year over year with domestic ASP growing 4.5% year over year.  As expected, US contribution margin at  34.3% expanded more moderately year over year, owing to the timing of content spend. In addition,  marketing expenses rose sequentially in support of our growing slate of originals and business  partnerships, which we expect to continue.   As Internet TV rises in popularity, so do the SVOD offerings.  In the US, for example, CBS All Access,  Seeso, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, YouTube Red, and many others are all growing. Our view, however, is  that we are all growing primarily against linear TV hours and that competition did not contribute  materially to our miss in Q2. First, increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions  rather than churn. Second, we experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April in Canada, where there  has been no recent increase in SVOD competition but where un-grandfathering is also underway.   Similarly, we don’t believe market saturation is a key factor in the US given that we experienced similar  performance over the same period in multiple countries with differing levels of Netflix market  penetration.     2  Our global membership forecast for Q3 includes an impact from the spectacle of the Olympics, on par  with what we experienced four years ago, and does not include any boost in the US from the Comcast  X1 launch due to uncertainty on timing as we and Comcast will only release Netflix on the X1 when the  viewer experience is great.   For Q3, we forecast US net adds of 0.3 million as un-grandfathering continues. We expect US  contribution margin to improve year over year in both Q3 and Q4 and we anticipate meeting our 40% US  contribution margin target by 2020, or even earlier.   International net additions in Q2 came to 1.5 million compared to our 2.0 million forecast.  Un-grandfathering occurred in Canada, UK/Ireland, Latin America, and the Nordics during Q2 where, like  the US, we saw a similar, earlier-than-expected impact on retention. In our newer markets, we continue  to learn and believe that growth will unfold over a multi-year period, similar to our experience in Latin  America.   International revenue rose 67% year over year. Excluding the impact of F/X (-$37 million impact on a y/y  basis), international ASP increased 8.7%. International contribution profit totaled -$69 million as content  spending was slightly lower than our forecast.  For Q3, we expect international net additions of 2.0m. Our approach in expanding our global footprint in  January was to launch a service targeting early adopters and then to listen, learn and iterate quickly.  Now that we are six months in, we will localize Netflix in Poland and Turkey with the addition of local  language in the user interface, subtitles and dubbing. Localization in other markets will take place over  time as economically prudent.   International contribution loss in Q3 is expected to be -$95 million as improving profitability in our  earlier foreign markets funds the investment in newer international territories. We remain confident in  these investments because of our success in all of the markets launched prior to 2014 which are  individually profitable on a contribution profit basis. These 2010-2013 launch markets are on track to  deliver \\u200baggregate contribution profit of around $500 million in 2016.  Prior to the global launch of our service in January, Netflix was available in 60 countries. In these earlier  expansion markets, our adoption rate in the first several months (as measured by penetration of  broadband households) has been highly varied and the initial uptake is not necessarily indicative of our  long-term penetration. We have already achieved success (contribution profits) in many types of  markets including those where English is not the main language (e.g. Chile); that have low pay TV  penetration (e.g. Australia); that have historically had high levels of piracy (e.g. Nordics); that have  payment or broadband infrastructure challenges (e.g. Mexico with payments and Canada with low data  caps); that have big competition (e.g. UK); that have low disposable income (e.g. Brazil); or that have  many of these factors (e.g. most of Latin America).         3  Unfortunately, this year the regulatory climate in China for our service has become more challenging.  Disney’s streaming service, launched in conjunction with Alibaba, was closed down, as was Apple’s  movie offering. We continue to explore options and, in the meantime, have plenty of work to do in our  newly opened markets.   Our global expansion is an exciting opportunity that will unfold over many years. Continued US growth  will be a part of it and there is no change to our view that in the US Netflix can reach 60-90 million  members. We continue to expect to run around break-even on a net income basis in 2016 and to  generate material profits in 2017 and beyond. We will drive operating profit growth in 2017 by reducing  our international losses and continuing to grow US profit.  Content  In Q2, we continued to expand the pace and breadth of original series, films and documentaries  released on Netflix, including the 4th season of \\u200bOrange is the New Black\\u200b and the second of our Adam  Sandler films, \\u200bThe Do Over\\u200b, \\u200bwhich, at launch, was the number one most-watched film on Netflix in every  territory of the world and remains in the top 10 in many countries, including the US.  The substantial viewing of our growing \\u200bslate of originals\\u200b around the world is a testament to how well  high quality English-language TV travels. Local content constitutes a small minority of total viewing in  our international segment. We do not plan on trying to outcompete local TV networks in local content in  every nation of the world. Rather, we selectively complement our service with licensed and original local  content. We are developing non-English language original series and films in more than a dozen  countries including Brazil, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, South Korea, Argentina and  Spain when we find compelling, high quality projects with attractive economics and a potentially large  audience around the world. \\u200bNarcos\\u200b, only partially in English, is an early success in this area.   We are also pleased with the critical acclaim received by our original programming. Last week, 17 of our  original series, documentaries, films and comedy specials received 54 Primetime Emmy nominations, up  from 34 last year. Netflix saw the largest increase in nominations among networks and has \\u200bthe third  most total nominations of any domestic network \\u200b(behind only FX and HBO). Earlier, nine of our kids’  shows received 33 Daytime Emmy nominations, more than any other network. We have made good  progress since launching our first original series \\u200bLilyhammer\\u200b in 2012.   While ramping up originals, we are also actively acquiring high quality, licensed content. We’ve  extended our licensing agreement with The CW Network, making Netflix the US SVOD home for prior  seasons of all scripted series broadcast on The CW beginning with the 2015-2016 TV season. Netflix  members will be able to stream full seasons of programs like \\u200bLegends of Tomorrow\\u200b, \\u200bSupergirl\\u200b, \\u200bArrow\\u200b and  The Flash\\u200b, \\u200bjust eight days after each season finale.\\u200b Next year, Netflix will also be the exclusive home of  the new \\u200bStar Trek\\u200b series from CBS outside the US and Canada, with new episodes arriving in 188  countries within 24 hours of their North American premiere.         4  Marketing  We primarily market our originals to drive member acquisition. Building off that, this past quarter we  began testing the availability of select episodes of a few of our original shows on linear television in  partnership with broadcasters. One week after its premiere on Netflix, the first two episodes of our first  French original series, \\u200bMarseille\\u200b, aired on French broadcast network TF1. Season one episodes (but not  season two) of \\u200bNarcos\\u200b and \\u200bClub de Cuervos\\u200b will air on Univision and Unimas, respectively, in the US.  Through these tactics, we’re aiming to entice consumers to join Netflix to complete their binge. The  danger is diluting the perception that Netflix original content is only on Netflix, so we are testing  cautiously.   Product and Partnerships  As we have noted in the past, our global expansion in January means that we are now operating in some  markets where consumers access the Internet primarily through mobile devices. This has led us to invest  more in our mobile experience including sign up, authentication, user interface, payments and  streaming efficiency for cellular networks. In Q2, we began testing Google Play in-app payment on  Android devices, which we think will aid our ability to acquire new customers in many international  markets, as our iOS in-app payments have done.   To date, we have partnered with over 40 MVPDs across the world to make it easier for consumers to  enjoy and pay for Netflix, to grow awareness of our service in certain markets and to reach different  demographic segments. In the US, we are excited that Netflix will be available on the Comcast X1 set-top  box later this year.   Strong Net Neutrality  We continue to make progress with Open Connect, and the approval of the Charter/TWC merger with a  seven year condition of settlement-free interconnect is a helpful precedent. When ISPs around the  world agree to take our Open Connect servers in or near their networks for free, they see reductions in  their network costs, and as a result, the program has continued to grow in popularity.   Competition  Our goal remains to win as many “moments of truth” as we can. Given all the leisure activities  consumers can engage in - reading a book, playing videogames, watching a sports match, etc. - we  compete with a very broad set of alternatives. Our focus is to improve Netflix every day across multiple  dimensions including content, streaming quality, device footprint, payment options, and more. If we can  do that, we believe we have ample room to grow.  There are an increasing number of virtual MVPDs, like Sony Vue, DISH’s Sling TV, Amazon’s Streaming  Partners Program, and Hulu’s \\u200bforthcoming service\\u200b, which offer a smaller bundle of TV channels at a  lower cost per month. To the degree these services provide an improved MVPD experience or spur  improvement amongst incumbent MVPDs to become more Internet-centric (on-demand, multi-screen,  personalized), they will become increased competition for entertainment time.   5  In the most recent Sandvine report, our share of North American Internet traffic was 35%. As we  referenced in our \\u200bQ4 ’15 letter\\u200b in January, our implementation of more efficient encoding would reduce  our results in the Sandvine report, which measures peak megabits, not peak viewing hours.     Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  In Q2’16, free cash flow amounted to -$254 million, compared with -$261 million in Q1’16. We finished  the quarter with cash and equivalents of $1.8 billion, while gross debt was unchanged at $2.4 billion. We  still plan to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016/early 2017.   Our capital requirements continue to be driven by our investment in original content, particularly  programming that we produce, which requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content. Original  content provides Netflix with many benefits: new programming that debuts on Netflix, exclusivity,  greater creative and business control, global rights and brand halo. These merits outweigh the timing of  cash payments.   Our choice to fund these requirements through debt rather than equity is based on our desire to  optimize our capital structure to yield the lowest possible weighted average cost of capital. Given our  low debt to total capital ratio, the after tax cost of debt is currently more attractive than equity.     DVD  We finished Q2’16 with 4.5 million DVD members in the US, and contribution profit of $71 million.  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bApril 2016\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary, 2016\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2015\\u200b,  July 2015\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2015\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2015\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2014\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2014\\u200b.       6  Summary  While we did not grow as fast as forecast in Q2, we are optimistic about the future owing to our singular  focus, global scale and the growth of Internet TV viewing. We are in the very early days of the shift from  linear television to on-demand viewing and there are nearly 1 billion pay TV subscribers worldwide who  will migrate to Internet TV over the coming decades.     On a personal note, this week we release season three of \\u200bBojack Horseman\\u200b -- since you all follow the  media business, this is a series you may love as much as we do.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 809-5360      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures\\xa0 This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the r\\u200belease of tax reserves\\u200b, and to free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.  However, these  non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding impacts on subscriber growth and revenue arising from  un-grandfathering; marketing expense in support of originals and partnerships; growth of Internet TV;  7  impacts on our business from competition; US growth, contribution margin and long-term subscriber  numbers; international growth, net additions and contribution loss; localization efforts; profitability in  2017 and beyond; content strategy, including local content, original and licensed content investments;  future capital raises and timing of such raises; forecasts for domestic and international net, total and  paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic  (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net  income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject  to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer  usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and,  competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and  events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers.

       " 'Q2_17_Shareholder_Letter': \"Fellow shareholders    For Q2, revenue and operating income were right on forecast. Our streaming membership grew more  than expected, from 99m to 104m, due to our amazing content. We also crossed the symbolic  milestones of 100m members and more international than domestic members. It was a good quarter.             1    Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast  Our quarterly guidance is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy. In Q2,  we underestimated the popularity of our strong slate of content which led to higher-than-expected  acquisition across all major territories. As a result, global net adds totaled a Q2-record 5.2 million (vs.  forecast of 3.2m) and increased 5% sequentially, bucking historical seasonal patterns. For the first six  months of 2017, net adds are up 21% year-on-year to 10.2m.  Our Q3 guidance assumes much of this momentum will continue but we are cognizant of the lessons of  prior quarters when we over-forecasted and there was lumpiness in net adds, likely due to demand  being pulled forward (into Q2 in this case).   Domestic net additions of 1.1m represented the highest level of Q2 net adds since the second quarter of  2011. For Q3’17, we project that we will add 0.75m US members, compared with 0.37m in Q3’16, which  was impacted by un-grandfathering.   Our international segment now accounts for 50.1% of our total membership base. International revenue  rose 57% year over year, excluding a -$23 million impact from foreign exchange, while international ASP  grew 10% year over year on a F/X neutral basis. International contribution profit of -$13 million vs. -$69  million was better than our -$28 million forecast due primarily to higher-than-forecasted paid members.   We’re forecasting Q3’17 international net adds of 3.65 million. We are making good progress with our  international expansion as improving profitability in our earlier international markets helps fund  significant investment in our newer territories. As a result, we expect\\u200b positive international  contribution profit for the full year 2017\\u200b, at current F/X exchange rates. This would mark the first ever  annual contribution profit from our international segment.  For Q2, global streaming revenue was within 1% of our projection.  As expected, operating margin  dipped 516 basis points sequentially due to the timing of content releases, and came in at $128m on  forecast of $120m. Through the first half of 2017, our operating margin was 7.1%, putting us on track for  our full year target of 7%, which we plan on growing in 2018 and beyond. Q2 EPS was on target at $0.15,  as a greater than expected tax benefit offset a -$64 million non-cash unrealized loss from our euro bond  (which was recognized in our P&L in interest and other income/expense).  Content  Last week, the Television Academy nominated 27 Netflix original programs with 91 Emmy nominations,  nearly double last year’s tally. With five of the 14 total nominated best series contenders (\\u200bStranger  Things, The Crown, House of Cards, Master of None \\u200band\\u200b Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\\u200b), Netflix had the  most nominated series of any network. We are proud that even as we have increased our volume of  originals across several genres, we continue to grow the recognition for the quality of those shows,  including brand new series like \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b and\\u200b The Crown\\u200b, which will have second season  premieres in 2017.   The volume and breadth of our releases in Q2 exemplify our commitment to serve the desires of our  diverse and growing audience. We premiered 14 new seasons of global Netflix original series, 13 original  2    comedy specials, 6 original documentaries, 2 original documentary series, 9 original feature films and 7  seasons of original series for kids.  You can track the dates of all of our upcoming launches \\u200bhere\\u200b.  We strive to be bold in our programming choices \\u200band\\u200b financially disciplined, so we can keep being bold.  Every show has passionate fans and committed talent striving for excellence. Sometimes those shows  don’t attract as many viewers as we had hoped, compared to our other content.  As much as we dislike  ending a series early, it consoles us that it frees up investment for another new show, or two.  We are  programming to please our members and we keep that as our guiding light. We love it when we support  a new series that has big impact like \\u200bStranger Things, Cable Girls,\\u200b and \\u200b13 Reasons Why\\u200b.   As a global TV network, we also showcase local productions to a worldwide audience through our  investments in non-English language originals. Our Spanish language original \\u200bIngobernable\\u200b, starring Kate  del Castillo, has been viewed by millions of members outside of Mexico. Similarly, in Q2, our first original  from Spain, \\u200bLas Chicas del Cable\\u200b (\\u200bCable Girls\\u200b), attracted significant viewership in the US and throughout  the entire Spanish-speaking world.  We understand that our approach to films - debuting movies on Netflix first - is counter to Hollywood’s  century-old windowing \\u200btradition\\u200b. But just as we changed and reinvented the TV business by putting  consumers first and making access to content more convenient, we believe internet TV can similarly  reinvigorate the film business (as distinct from the theatrical business). This year we will release 40  features that range from big budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema.  We are proud to  produce films like \\u200bOkja\\u200b, \\u200bWar Machine\\u200b and \\u200bBright,\\u200b with big stars, distinctive directors and compelling  stories, as well as to introduce new voices like Macon Blair, whose directorial debut \\u200bI Don’t Feel at Home  in This World Anymore\\u200b, produced by Netflix, won the Dramatic Jury competition at the Sundance Film  Festival this year. Within a few weeks of the win, it premiered on Netflix everywhere, so that it could be  enjoyed by fans, exactly when the world was talking about it.  Product and Partnerships  Since the early days of our streaming service, we have partnered with a wide variety of companies to  make it easier for consumers to enjoy Netflix. Our partnerships began with consumer electronic  companies and video game consoles and evolved to include smartphone makers, mobile operators and  MVPDs and ISPs. In Q2, we announced a partnership with Altice/SFR France, whereby Netflix will be sold  in a package with high speed Internet and TV services. These arrangements are mutually beneficial - our  partners gain more customers and can upsell existing subscribers to higher ARPU packages, while Netflix  gains more reach and awareness with consumers across a market. We are likely to expand this approach  as a complement to our direct-to-consumer primary approach.   Competition  The competition for entertainment time is always intense, but the silver lining is that the market is vast  and diverse. YouTube is earning over a billion hours a day of consumers’ time with one type of  entertainment, while we are earning over a billion hours a week with our type of entertainment. Linear  TV is still huge, piracy still substantial, and there are thousands of firms and approaches around the  world earning some fraction of consumers’ entertainment time. The entertainment market is so broad  3    that we’ve grown from zero to over 50m streaming households in the US over the last 10 years, and yet  HBO continues to increase its US subscriptions. It seems our growth just expands the market. The largely  exclusive nature of each service’s content means that we are not direct substitutes for each other, but  rather complements.   In addition to the many SVOD players around the world (Blim, Globoplay, FilmStruck, Hooq, iflix, Stan,  etc.) the large-cap tech companies, especially Amazon, are investing heavily in original and licensed  content around the world. They join all the existing TV networks (BBC, AMC, NHK, etc.) of the world, and  us, in bidding for great content. Creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment  is pouring into content production around the world.   We are all co-pioneers of internet TV and, together, we are replacing linear TV. The shift from linear TV  to on-demand viewing is so big and there is so much leisure time, many internet TV services will be  successful. The internet may not have been great for the music business due to piracy, but, wow, it is  incredible for growing the video entertainment business around the world.   Culture  We recently crafted a major update on our \\u200bculture description\\u200b, to reflect our thinking as we have  become more global. Our culture plays a major role in our continued evolution and success.     Free Cashflow and Capital Structure  Q2’17 free cash amounted to -$608 million vs. -$254 million in the year ago quarter and -$423 million in  Q1’17. We anticipate free cash flow of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017. With our content  strategy paying off in strong member, revenue and profit growth, we think it’s wise to continue to  invest. In continued success, we will deploy increased capital in content, particularly in owned originals,  and, as we have said before, we expect to be FCF negative for many years. Since our FCF is driven by our  content investment, particularly in self-produced originals, we wanted to provide some additional  context on our content accounting at our \\u200binvestor relations\\u200b website.   We continue to debt finance our capital needs as we believe this reduces our weighted average cost of  capital, resulting in a more efficient capital structure. In May, we completed a 1.3 billion euro bond  offering. In addition to a small natural hedge to our growing European revenues, we are pleased to have  broadened our access to capital markets beyond the US high yield market. Our euro bond may add some  volatility to our net income as each quarter we remeasure the liability on our balance sheet based on  the quarter end euro-to-dollar exchange rate. As a reminder, quarter-to-quarter remeasurement  changes in this liability are reflected as a non-cash unrealized gain (loss) below operating income in  “interest and other income/expense” in our P&L (-$64 million impact on net income in Q2’17).   Summary  It’s been twenty years since Netflix was founded and we still thrive on connecting people with great  stories. Someday, we hope to entertain everyone.    4    For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bApril 2017\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2017\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2016\\u200b,  July 2016\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2016\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary, 2016\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2015\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2015\\u200b.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 809-5360      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer      310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures\\xa0 This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free  cash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding the acquisition impact of our content slate; growth of  internet video; content strategy, including future launches; future capital raises; impact of Euro bond  raise on net income; partnership strategies; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers;  revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic international operations,  as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free  cash flow.  The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could  cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions;  production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of  different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks  and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such  forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  5    including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January  27, 2017. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual  performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above  and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking  statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.    6      7 Netflix, Inc.

We expect Q4 net additions to be approximately equal to Q4 of the prior year and to expand  our contribution margin about 400 basis points year over year to about 23%, assuming the midpoint of  our guidance.  This means that sequentially our target contribution margin is slightly down Q3 to Q4.  As  a reminder, we shifted our contribution margin target a few months ago from “100 basis points of  quarterly sequential improvement” to “400 basis points Q over prior year Q” so we are right on target  with our articulated margin growth strategy.  Our $7.99 price is working very well for us for both  membership growth and contribution margin growth.        While our original series get most of the headlines, a bigger percentage of overall Netflix viewing is  generated by our exclusive complete season-after series. During the quarter, we launched new seasons  of The New Girl, The Walking Dead, Scandal, Breaking Bad, Revolution and Pretty Little Liars. We also  announced that Netflix will be the exclusive home to high quality first-run Pay1 films from The  Weinstein Company beginning in 2016.  Our kids offering was strengthened during the quarter by  adding top rated and award winning Scholastic TV shows, Goosebumps and The Magic School Bus.  We  also announced an expanded list of PBS shows including Super Why!, Wild Kratts, Caillou and Arthur, as  well as all seasons of the critically-acclaimed mystery The Bletchley Circle.    International  International net additions were way up from the prior year at 1.4 million new members, driven by our  expansion to the Nordics and the Netherlands since last Q3, as well as growth in our existing markets  from our steadily improving service, content and marketing.  In addition, there was a surge in low  quality free trials in September in Latin America that temporarily boosted the total member number.   The paid net adds remain a reliable indicator of progress.    Our Q3 international contribution loss was $74 million, as we saw flat to slight sequential improvements  in contribution profits in all international markets during the quarter, offset by the Netherlands launch  expense.        In Q4, assuming the midpoint of our guidance, we expect continued momentum to result in about 1.3  million net additions, to end 2013 with 10.5 million international members. This compares to 1.8 million  net additions in Q4 a year ago, which was our Nordics launch quarter.  In all our other markets (Canada,  Latin America, UK/IE, Netherlands), we expect net additions to be steady or up on a Q4 over Q4 basis.     Sequentially, we expect international total member net adds in Q4 to be flat to down (1.4 million in Q3  to 1.3 million) as we work through the low-quality Latin America free trials from Q3, but paid net adds in  Q4 are forecasted to rise (1.1 million in Q3 to 1.3 million).    3    For Q4, we expect our contribution losses to improve to $65 million, assuming the midpoint of our  guidance.      We plan to launch in new markets next year, executing on the strategy outlined in our long term view  letter. Our success this year in increasing international net additions to nearly the level of our domestic  net additions shows substantial momentum and confirms our belief there is a big international  opportunity for Netflix.     Original Content  An excellent summary of our early progress in original content is this two-minute video.      Over the next few years we aspire to support creation of some of the most compelling and remarkable  content ever produced.  Coupled with the flexibility of our Internet viewing and power of our personal  recommendations we will keep changing television for the better.       Orange is the New Black has been a tremendous success for us. It will end the year as our most watched  original series ever and, as with each of our other previously launched originals, enjoys an audience  comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV.  We have seen sustained social media  buzz in the months after its debut and it is also one of the most critically well received TV shows of 2013.   Orange is the New Black was not eligible for the Emmys in 2013, but Season 1 will be eligible next year  and we believe the audience for Season 2 will grow substantially.     Speaking of Emmys, we were thrilled to be a part of TV history in the quarter by winning 3 Emmy awards  (3 of our original series received 14 total nominations).  David Fincher’s win for Outstanding Director in a  Drama Series made House of Cards the first TV series to win a major primetime Emmy without ever  airing on a broadcast network or cable channel. We were delighted for David as well as Laray Mayfield  and Julie Schubert who won for Outstanding Casting in a Drama Series and Eigil Bryld who picked up an  Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single Camera Series.  In addition to Orange is the New Black, during Q3, we launched the new Ricky Gervais series Derek and  broadened our original content offering with the acquisition of high profile stand up comedy specials  from Russell Peters and Aziz Ansari, premiering exclusively on Netflix in October and November,  respectively. We also rolled out a second set of episodes of Mako Mermaids, our original series directed  at the teen audience, and will soon expand into original documentaries, a category that does well on the  Netflix service.   This quarter we will premiere our inaugural second season of a Netflix original series with the return of  Lilyhammer starring Steven Van Zandt. We will also be launching our first animated original series with  Dreamworks Animation, Turbo F.A.S.T.  4  In 2014, we expect to double our investment in original content (though still representing less than 10%  of our overall global content expense).  Coming to Netflix next year will be second seasons of House of  Cards, Orange is the New Black, Derek and Hemlock Grove as well as the just announced project from  Todd and Glenn Kessler and Daniel Zelman, the Emmy and Golden Globe nominated creators of  Damages.  We’ll also roll out a number of new animated series from DreamWorks Animation.  Expect  more news on additional new original projects in the months to come.   When we started with original content we didn’t have specific data about viewing patterns over time for  content that premieres on Netflix.  We decided to use straight line amortization based on our  experience with TV series from other networks.  Now we have more specific viewing data for original  content which shows more viewing in the early months of a show’s debut, so we are accelerating the  amortization of such content commensurately.  We’ll continue to monitor the viewing patterns and  adjust the amortization schedule as appropriate.   Marketing  Our global marketing campaigns promote compelling content, unique product features and the joy of  the Netflix experience.  These messages are adapted market by market to form deeper brand  connections with our customers wherever they live.    Q3 saw the launch of our Netherlands ‘All You Can Watch’ campaign and new advertising in the Nordic  countries and Brazil, all of which communicate our brand proposition nuanced for local tastes.    We continue to feature our content in advertising.  Our goal is to shape customer perceptions of our  catalog through an always-on layer of content marketing targeted at specific demographic groups. Last  month we launched “TV Too” in which we are promoting the wealth of TV series on Netflix, taking  advantage of the tremendous influx of new seasons coming into the service with the message ‘Discover,  Relive, Start from the Beginning’.    With regard to online advertising, we continue to improve our global efficiency and targeting with  investments in programmatic and online video advertising.  Our aim is to target consumers with the  right message at the right stage of their consumer journey in both direct response and brand messages.    Product  During Q3, we launched profiles, offering individual personalization for each member of a household  and “My List” to help all members save titles to watch later in a more organized and adaptive manner  than our prior Instant Queue, which was available only to U.S. members.  Both of these features help  members find and engage with films and TV series matched to their individual tastes.    5  The growth of smart TVs and Internet TV devices, such as AppleTV, Roku, and Chromecast, are  increasing the availability of TV streaming platforms.  Tablets and phones also are rapidly growing as  Netflix viewing platforms.      We launched with Virgin Media, the UK’s leading cable company, a world first:  Netflix on a major cable  set-top box.  It is rolling out over this quarter to Virgin Media’s subscribers.  The integration of search  and suggestions between broadband and cable is great for customers, and we want this superior  experience to help Virgin Media gain market share in the UK.      Cable operators like Virgin Media believe that by enabling their subscribers to do more with their cable  set-top and remote, they can increase satisfaction, relative to their subscribers using a separate Internet  set-top box or smart TV to enjoy Netflix.  We are open to more of these integrations with cable set-tops  around the world, but given the fragmented technology footprints, we think it will be many years before  cable set-top boxes match Internet set-top boxes for Netflix streaming volume.  As a general rule, we’re  happy to support devices from other video providers as long as we get application placement  commensurate with our popularity.      DVD  The huge selection we offer on DVD, including all the HBO and other Pay TV series, continues to be a  source of satisfaction for 7.15 million domestic households, and we generated $107 million of  contribution profit, as expected.  With the USPS rate announcement in September, we anticipate a  postal rate increase in January of 3 cents each way or $3-4 million per quarter of additional expense in  2014.    Profitability  We were pleased with our global profitability for Q3.  We delivered on our targets despite the faster  amortization of original content, which pulled forward into Q3 about $27 million in expense from future  quarters, due to more members and revenue than expected and by adjusting spending in Q3 on other  items.  The effect of the faster amortization of original content is small enough that we are not changing  our domestic contribution margin targets (400 basis points Q over prior year Q) or our global  profitability targets (stay profitable despite international investments).            6  Stock Volatility  In calendar year 2003 we were the highest performing stock on Nasdaq.  We had solid results  compounded by momentum-investor-fueled euphoria.  Some of the euphoria today feels like 2003.      Despite the huge swings in our stock price since our 2002 IPO ($8 to $3 to $39 to $8 to $300 to $55 to  $330), we’ve continued to grow our membership every year fairly steadily.  We do our best to ignore the  volatility in our stock.  The progress we’ve made over the last 10 years is stunning.  We want to make  the next 10 years even more remarkable.    Business Outlook  We have also updated our long term view letter.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating  income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial  measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP  measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding meeting domestic contribution margin targets;  international contribution losses; expansion into new geographic markets and the impact of  international expansion; investments in content, particularly original content, including second seasons  of original content and new categories of original content; business outlook for our DVD segment,  including contribution profit and the impact of a USPS rate increase; the rate and impact of integration  on cable set-top boxes; member growth domestically and internationally, including total and paid;  revenue and contribution profit (loss) for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international  operations as well as net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2013.  The forward- looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain  existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms  for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our  website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service;  competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013.  We undertake no obligation to update  forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                           9 Netflix, Inc.

Domestic streaming revenue of $877 million,  in-line with forecast, grew 25% y/y and faster than membership due to the expansion of ASP from the  price changes implemented in Q2.     We added two million members internationally, to end the quarter with 15.84 million members, with  lower net adds than our forecast, but higher than prior year.  International revenue of $346 million, in- line with forecast, grew 89% y/y, and faster than membership, again due to the expansion of our ASP.     As a reminder, we provide you our internal forecast for the current quarter.  For the prior three  quarters, we under-forecasted membership growth.  This quarter we over-forecasted membership  growth.  We’ll continue to give you our internal forecast for the current quarter, and it will be high some  of the time and low other times.     Separate from forecast variability, year on year net additions in the US were down (1.3 million in Q3  2013 to 1 million in Q3 2014).  As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now  have compared to a year ago.  Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth, other things being  equal, and this is manifested more clearly in higher adoption markets such as the US.       In hindsight, we believe that late Q2 and early Q3 the impact of higher prices appeared to be offset for  about two months by the large positive reception to Season Two of Orange is the New Black.    We remain happy with the price changes and growth in revenue and will continue to improve our  service, with better content, better streaming and better choosing.  The effect of slightly higher prices is  factored into our Q4 forecast.        Since our per-member viewing and retention in the US are as strong as ever, we don’t think increased  competition from piracy, TV Everywhere, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Hulu, etc, is a major factor.      There is no change to our view on the long term attractiveness and US market size of Internet television,  and no change to our view of the ultimate size of our US membership.      We are forecasting Q4 US contribution margin to increase almost 500 basis points on a y/y basis, but to  decrease slightly sequentially, as it did last year from Q3 to Q4, due to significant sequential increases in  content and marketing expense.         In September, we had a very successful launch in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and  Luxembourg, adding about 66 million1 broadband households to our addressable market.  In recent  days, our app has gone live on set-top boxes from SFR in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany, and                                                              1 SNL Kagan  3    we expect deployments this quarter from Orange and Bouygues in France, and Belgacom in Belgium.   We’ve had more success, more quickly, with MVPD set-top boxes in these new markets than anywhere  else in the world.      As expected, we have a full quarter of new market expenses weighing on our international contribution  margins in Q4, increasing contribution loss from Q3 to Q4.  Our international markets launched prior to  this year (Canada 4 years ago through Netherlands 1 year ago) are now collectively profitable on a  contribution basis and will continue to help us fund new markets. Moreover, contribution margin from  our first expansion market, Canada, now approximates the US.    Starting in January, we have to pay higher VAT in most of Europe due to changes in European law  (country of origin to country of destination).  We will absorb these increases rather than pass them on to  our members.  This absorption will be reflected in slightly lower international contribution margin/profit  starting in Q1 than we would otherwise have.  Given how well our international expansion has performed, we intend substantial further expansion in  2015, consistent with our stated strategy.    US contribution margin increases beyond 30%  Our US contribution margin grew about 500 bps to 28.6% for Q3.  After achieving 30% contribution  margin, likely in Q1 or Q2 of next year, we will seek to grow margins an average of 200 basis points per  year for the following years.  Ideally, we will achieve 40% contribution margin five years after achieving  30%.  This increase in our domestic contribution margin gives us room to increase content spending as  we grow, as well as substantial domestic profitability.   Content  In Q3, we launched several new original series, documentaries and comedy specials, while ensuring  future access to one of the most successful and globally appealing series of the North American fall TV  season, Gotham.  In our second year of qualification as a programmer, Netflix took home seven Emmy  awards.  Original Series  BoJack Horseman marked our expansion into the popular adult animated comedy genre. In the past,  we’ve licensed back seasons of already successful series like Archer, Futurama, and Bob’s Burgers.   BoJack Horseman, starring Will Arnett, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris, drew more viewers in its first few  weeks than any of these established network shows over a comparable period on Netflix, confirming for  us the value of expanding into original series.  TV Guide wrote that BoJack Horseman was the “funniest  show of the fall” and we are now in production on season two for 2015.  In Q3,  we also  launched a second season of Hemlock Grove and an original 4th and final season of The  Killing.  Both shows have been well received globally.  We are now in pre-production of the final season  4    of Hemlock Grove.  We also premiered two acclaimed British series in North America, Happy Valley (in  US and Canada) and Peaky Blinders (US only).   We are looking forward to the December 12 release of our next major original series Marco Polo, an  epic, cinematic tale of power, adventure and betrayal.   We are currently in production on nine Netflix original series around the world and during the quarter  announced a new comedy series, Love, from Judd Apatow, premiering in 2016.  Original Documentary, Kids and Comedy  Beyond scripted series, we launched three original documentaries in the quarter, Battered Bastards of  Baseball, Mission Blue and Print the Legend.  These documentaries have grown in audience reach and  have positioned Netflix as a significant player in a category that attracts some of the most loyal and  intense viewers.  Finishing off the year, we will release E-Team, a powerful journalistic film from Oscar  winning director Ross Kauffman and Katy Chevigny, and Virunga, a riveting film about the tensions over  one of Africa’s best known national parks and the home of the mountain gorillas.     Netflix continues to be a key destination for kids and families.  We now offer members 75 kids series  that are each delighting more than 2 million viewers on Netflix. More than a dozen of these series, many  of them exclusive to Netflix, reach over 5 million viewers.  During the quarter, we announced a  partnership with Saban Brands to reboot the popular Popples animated series, with Rainbow Studios to  extend their Winx Club stories and with storied producer Avi Arad and 41 Entertainment to produce a  CGI film and series with a new take on the origin story of King Kong.  In Q4, we will launch on Netflix the  premiere episodes of two original series from DreamWorks Animation, the return of the beloved kids  franchise Veggie Tales and All Hail King Julien, based on the popular character from Madagascar.  Last week, Chelsea Handler’s Uganda Be Kidding Me Live arrived globally on Netflix to strong viewing  and rave reviews.  Next year, Chelsea will create four comedy documentaries for Netflix with her new  take on the traditional talk show to follow in 2016.  In Q3, Jim Jeffries brought his latest stand-up show  to Netflix members, while this quarter, our members will enjoy new material from Chelsea Peretti  (Brooklyn Nine Nine) , Bill Burr, Wyatt Cenac (The Daily Show) and the legendary Bill Cosby.   Original Films  On August 28, 2015, we will release our first Netflix original film, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green  Legend.  A big budget continuation of the beloved 2000 Oscar-nominated film, it will debut  simultaneously on select global IMAX screens and in Ultra HD 4k on Netflix, offering consumers the  option to see this beautiful action film how and when they want.  Separately, we announced plans to  release only on Netflix four new Adam Sandler feature comedies, beginning in early 2016.  Sandler is a  true global movie star, grossing over $3 billion over the last twenty years, and generating huge viewing  across all Netflix territories.  We are investing in original films because doing so can be favorable  economically compared to current Pay TV deals and is consistent with the desires of the global on- 5    demand generation to enjoy new movies without having to wait for months after they debut in US  theaters.  Multi-territory Television Licensing  In Q3, we secured second window rights from Warner Bros. Television for the Fox series Gotham in all  current and planned Netflix territories.  This historic deal will deliver the series to Netflix members soon  after the broadcast completion of each season and ensures that Netflix will be the only subscription  video service in these territories to offer the Batman origin series, commercial free and on demand in  full season presentations.   In our just launched territories in Europe, Netflix debuted as original series the Emmy-winning Fargo  from MGM Television as well as From Dusk Till Dawn from El Rey and Penny Dreadful from CBS  Television.  These deals ensure our international members access to hit US television series without  having to wait the months or years imposed by traditional TV models and should help to reduce piracy in  those markets.   Product  Improved Laptop Streaming  We are midway through switching to native HTML5 streaming for our laptop players, eliminating  downloads (of Silverlight) and improving the consumer proposition with a smoother playback  experience and longer battery life.  This has been a successful four-year effort to get strong DRM  integrated into the major browsers.      Set-top Boxes  Using the same techniques we developed to get on hundreds of different Blu-ray players and Smart TVs,  we are now able to support a wide variety of MVPD set-top devices with an outstanding and updatable  application.  The Virgin/TiVo architecture was our first, which is a fairly modern system.    We have since  expanded to less high-end systems.       Personal recommendations  We have continued to improve our various recommendations systems, which match users to content  based upon their preferences.  We have rolled out a new visual search feature on the website and  mobile platforms; it includes suggested viewing possibilities for searches that come up empty.        6    Strong Net Neutrality  We continue to focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, to prevent large ISPs from  holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance in order to extract payments from us, other  Internet content firms, and Internet transit suppliers such as Level 3 and Cogent.   We’ve increased awareness of this issue globally.  Our efforts have helped generate a record breaking  number of comments to the FCC in favor of net neutrality, while in Europe policymakers are beginning  to focus on this issue.  We will continue to advocate for the US government to block the merger of Comcast/TWC or, at the  very least, prevent a combined entity from charging for interconnection.    HBO  Starting back in 2011 we started saying that HBO would be our primary long-term competitor,  particularly for content. The competition will drive us both to be better.  It was inevitable and sensible  that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application.  Many people will subscribe to  both Netflix and HBO since we have different shows, so we think it is likely we both prosper as  consumers move to Internet TV.      DVD  Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight about 6 million members, adding $89 million in  contribution profit in Q3 and we anticipate close to the same in Q4.    Operating Income  Operating income nearly doubled y/y to $110 million despite our investment in international expansion.   To support this expansion, we’ve invested in personnel growth in our corporate G&A functions which is  the primary driver of both the y/y and sequential increase in G&A.  Also contributing to the sequential  increase was an increase in legal fees and one-time costs related to the launch of our new markets.            7  Free Cash Flow & Content Obligations Historically, FCF tracked close to net income.  As we’ve written previously, our increased use of cash for  content, especially originals, will cause FCF to be materially less than net income, at least for the years  ahead while we are increasing our investment in this area.  In addition, in quarters like Q3 with big  international territory launches, we have only a partial quarter of international content P&L expense but  a full quarter of cash payments.  We finished the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash.    Our total streaming content obligations increased to $8.9 billion in the quarter from $7.7 billion at the  end of Q2, which includes $3.6 billion on the balance sheet.  The increase was driven by the multi-year  commitments associated with our latest market launches in Europe and the continued expansion of our  original programming, including our first original movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Green Legend.

Summary The overwhelming consumer benefits of Internet television, in terms of convenience, control, selection,  and price, continue to expand our opportunity.   8    Sincerely,                                                                                           Reed Hastings, CEO      David Wells, CFO                                                                                                                         October 15, 2014 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview today at 3 p.m.  Pacific Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance; content  offerings; device and platform integration; forecast variability; member growth domestically and  internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin  for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating  income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including,  without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to  compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations  in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service  Providers; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.  The Company provides internal forecast  numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers  based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                 10 Netflix, Inc.

       " 'Q3_17_Shareholder_Letter_COMBINED': \"Fellow shareholders,    We are growing nicely across the world and are on track to exceed $11 billion in revenue in 2017.  Internet entertainment is delighting consumers, and we are staying at the forefront of this  once-in-a-generation opportunity.         1  Q3 Results and Q4 Forecast  Global streaming revenue in Q3 rose 33% year over year, driven by a 24% increase in average paid  memberships and 7% growth in ASP. Operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $209 million  with our Q3 global operating margin of 7.0% putting us right on track to achieve our full year target of  7%. EPS of $0.29 included a pre-tax $51 million non-cash loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro  bond (or $39 million after tax based on a 24% tax rate). Higher than expected excess tax benefit from  stock based compensation benefited our tax rate by $5 million vs. our forecast. As a reminder, the  quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.   We added a Q3-record 5.3 million memberships globally (up 49% year-over-year) as we continued to  benefit from strong appetite for our original series and films, as well as the adoption of internet  entertainment across the world. Relative to our guidance of 4.4 million net adds, we under-forecasted  both US and international acquisition. Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29% versus last year.   Domestic contribution margin in Q3 of 35.8% vs. 36.4% last year was below our forecast of 37.1% due  primarily to the earlier-than-anticipated close of certain content deals. The foreign currency impact in  the quarter was +$13 million and  Q3 international revenue grew 54% year over year, excluding  currency. F/X-neutral ASP increased 7.4% year over year. International contribution profit margin of  4.7% exceeded our 2.3% guidance, also due to the timing of content deals.   For Q4, we forecast global net adds of 6.30m (1.25m in the US and 5.05m internationally) vs. 7.05m in  the year ago quarter (which was our all-time high for quarterly net adds). We recently announced price  adjustments in many markets to our HD and 4K video plans while keeping our SD plan mostly unchanged  (still $7.99 in the US, for instance). Existing members will be notified and their prices will be adjusted on  a rolling basis over the next few months. Increased revenue over time will help us grow our content  offering and continue our global operating margin growth.   We’ve been focused on growing global operating margin as our primary profitability metric since hitting  our 2020 US contribution margin goal of 40% this past Q1. This allows us to avoid near term  optimization for specific domestic or international contribution margin targets which could impede our  long term growth. For instance, we anticipate our Q4’17 US contribution margin will be 34.4% (a decline  both year-on-year and sequentially) as we boost our marketing investment against a growing content  slate. We spend disproportionately in the US to generate media and influencer awareness for our  programming which we believe, in turn, is an effective way to facilitate word of mouth globally. In our  international segment, we are on track to generate positive contribution profit for the full year. As we  move into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing  operating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the  rest of the world.         2  Content  Five years ago, we embarked on our original programming strategy and we’re very pleased with our  progress in transforming Netflix from a service with not just second run content but also must-see new  releases, like \\u200bStranger Things\\u200b, \\u200bOrange is the New Black\\u200b, \\u200bHouse of Cards, Fuller House, Making a  Murderer, Narcos, The Crown\\u200b and \\u200b13 Reasons Why\\u200b, among many others.   This quarter, we launched several new series such as the gritty drama \\u200bOzark\\u200b and comedy \\u200bFriends from  College\\u200b by Nick Stoller as well as \\u200bMarvel’s The Defenders \\u200band returning seasons of fan favorites like  Narcos \\u200band \\u200bFuller House\\u200b. We’re also making good strides on original films (as measured by member  viewing relative to our investment) with the debut of \\u200bDeath Note\\u200b (based on the popular Japanese IP),  Naked\\u200b (a romantic comedy featuring Marlon Wayans) and \\u200bTo the Bone\\u200b (an intense drama starring Lily  Collins).   Investors often ask us about continued access to content from diversified media companies.  While we  have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term  trends are clear. Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around  Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes. Our  investment in Netflix originals is over a quarter of our total P&L content budget in 2017 and will  continue to grow.  With $17 billion in content commitments over the next several years and a growing  library of owned content ($2.5 billion net book value at the end of the quarter), we remain quite  comfortable with our ability to please our members around the world. We’ll spend $7-8 billion on  content (on a P&L basis) in 2018.   Just as we moved from second-run content to licensed originals and then to Netflix-produced originals,  we are progressing even further up the value chain to work directly with talented content creators. In  August, we announced an overall deal with \\u200bShonda Rhimes\\u200b, the creator of global smash hits like \\u200bGrey’s  Anatomy\\u200b, \\u200bHow to Get Away with Murder\\u200b, \\u200bScandal\\u200b, and others. We also acquired \\u200bMillarworld\\u200b, our one  M&A transaction in our 20 year history, the home of legendary comic book writer Mark Millar. Our goal  is to work with the best creators in the world and own the underlying intellectual property so that we  can continue to deliver amazing content to our members across the globe.   In working with the best talent, we strive hard for awards recognition. At this year’s Primetime Emmys,  we scored 20 wins out of 92 nominations, second only to HBO, spread across eight different titles.   Competition  Since 2013, we’ve taken the \\u200bLong Term View\\u200b that we’re in the early stages of the worldwide,  multi-decade transition from linear TV to internet entertainment. Recently, it’s been unfolding right  before our eyes: \\u200bDisney\\u200b announced plans to launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and its other  brands, cable network owners are licensing their channels to virtual MVPDs like Hulu, YouTube, Sling TV,  and DirecTV Now, CBS’ All Access is expanding \\u200binternationally\\u200b, Apple is reportedly planning on spending  $1 billion on original content and Amazon is streaming NFL games while its Prime Video service has gone  global. Facebook launched its \\u200bWatch tab\\u200b for original videos.   3  At the same time, linear TV networks like \\u200bMTV\\u200b, \\u200bA&E\\u200b and \\u200bWGN\\u200b are cutting down on scripted series. Last  year, the number of original scripted series on linear TV (across broadcast, premium and basic cable)  began to decrease as online services ramped up activity.  It’s an exciting period and both media and technology companies see the same big opportunity as we  do. We have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible to please our  members by earning their viewing time and to stay ahead of the competition in the decades to come.   Product and Partnerships  Ironically, as linear networks move outside of the traditional bundle and into direct-to-consumer  applications, we are working more closely than ever with MVPDs/ISPs and other distributors. Building on  our Q2 partnership with SFR/Altice in France, where Netflix is sold in a package with high speed Internet  and TV services, and an earlier, comparable partnership with Proximus of Belgium, this past quarter we  announced the bundling of Netflix into \\u200bT-Mobile’s ONE family plan\\u200b. Our partners are enthusiastic about  the response to these bundles as the excitement around our big content enhances their offerings.   Our goal with all of our partnerships is to make it easy for members to sign up, pay and enjoy Netflix. We  are pleased with the early results and we will continue pursuing these bundling opportunities as a  complement to our core direct-to-consumer approach.   Free Cashflow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow in Q3 totaled -$465 million vs. -$506 million last year and -$608 million in Q2’17. There is  no change to our expectation for FCF of -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion for the full year 2017.  Negative FCF,  despite growing operating income, is due to growth of our content spend, original content in particular,  where we pay for the titles before consumers enjoy the content, and the asset is amortized by  estimated viewing over time. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market as our  after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity.   Summary   This quarter, among other new offerings, we are releasing the second Netflix original series from David  Fincher (\\u200bMindhunter), \\u200bnew seasons of our globally acclaimed franchises \\u200bStranger Things \\u200band \\u200bThe Crown,  our first Italian and German original shows (\\u200bSuburra\\u200b and\\u200b Dark)\\u200b and our most ambitious film yet, \\u200bBright\\u200b,  starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer.   We feel privileged to be working with great artists all over the world and to be able to bring their  creations to a big, and growing, global audience. We’re delighted that consumers are embracing internet  entertainment and are finding value and pleasure in the incredible stories offered by Netflix.

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity  metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to  repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in  operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding growing revenues and our position within internet  entertainment; price changes, increasing revenues, content spend and growing margin; marketing  spend; investment in Asia and Rest of World markets; our original programming strategy; access to  content, competition, and partnerships, including bundles; free cash flow and financing; domestic and  international net, total and paid members; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin  for both domestic international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin;  net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without  limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete  effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms and partnerships for streaming our service;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is  5  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2017. The Company  provides internal forecast numbers.

The  healthy y/y growth in net additions was likely fueled by our service improvements, marketing  effectiveness, and sales of Internet connected devices.    We expect this momentum to continue in Q1 with net additions of 2.25 million to exceed the prior year  by about 11%.  Running equal to, or slightly above, prior year net additions is a great outcome because it  implies that at 33 million domestic members we’re still in the middle section of the S curve of consumer  adoption, with years of member growth ahead of us.    Our US contribution margin during the quarter increased 420 basis points y/y to 23.4%, as we continued  to grow membership and revenue faster than content expense. Over the past 8 quarters since we first  broke out the streaming segment, our contribution margin has expanded significantly from the 12.2%  posted in Q4’11.  Our strong results indicate that a 30% quarterly contribution margin may start being achievable in 2015.   At 30%, we’d re-evaluate the right margin growth target, given conditions at that time.  To the extent  our contribution margin climbs above 30%, it will get harder to keep it growing at 400 basis points per  year.  Last April we introduced a 4-concurrent stream $11.99 option to begin our evaluation of plan tiering.  Since late last year, we have also been testing 1-stream and 3-stream variants, as well as SD/HD  variations, at various price points.  Eventually, we hope to be able to offer new members a selection of  three simple options to fit everyone’s taste.   If we do make pricing changes for new members, existing members would get generous grandfathering  of their existing plans and prices, so there would be no material near-term revenue increase from  moving to this potential broader set of options.  We are in no rush to implement such new member  plans and are still researching the best way to proceed.  As a reminder, Q2 net additions will typically be less than the prior year, even in a year where total net  additions are up, due to increased seasonality that comes with a bigger member base.  (See the very end  of our Q1 2012 earnings letter for an explanation.)  In addition, in Q2 2013  we launched Arrested  Development, which had a strong established brand and passionate fan base, generating a small boost in  membership, making Q2 2014 a tougher than normal comp period.    Our domestic growth is very strong, much of which should be attributed to the tailwind of Internet video  growth in general.  Hulu had 3 CEOs in 2013, and yet grew paid subscribers an impressive 65%.  We  think YouTube, Amazon Instant Video, iTunes video and BBC iPlayer are also growing fast.     In the traditional MVPD sector, there is lots of activity that may affect us on the margin.  Verizon is  buying the Intel Internet MVPD system and recently bought a CDN (EdgeCast) and streaming software  3  firm (UpLynk).  These are big investments, so they clearly have big plans.  Sony announced they are  launching an Internet MVPD system this year.  Finally, depending on the decision of the Supreme Court,  Aereo will either have to pay for the broadcast content like MVPDs, or the MVPDs will no longer be  obliged to pay. Within the MVPD ecosystem, there are potentially big shake ups.  In contrast, we  continue licensing and producing more exclusive content for our direct-to-consumer business, and are  relatively unaffected by the big bundle questions.      International  We’re making great progress internationally, with strong member growth and contribution profit/loss  improving sequentially in all of our markets (with the exception of the Netherlands as it had its first full  quarter of operations and thus loss in Q4).  We saw healthy growth in net additions of 1.74 million in Q4  to end the year at 10.93 million members, slightly above our guidance.  As anticipated, Q4 net additions  were down slightly from the prior year Q4, as we launched four Nordic markets in Q4 2012 versus the  relatively smaller Netherlands launch in Q3 2013.    In Q1 of 2014, we are forecasting an almost 60% increase in net additions from the prior year, from 1.02  million to 1.60 million.  We’ve seen increases in consumer brand awareness and likelihood to  recommend across markets as our content offering builds and marketing messages are honed, factors  that help drive the y/y growth in net additions.    Throughout 2013 we made substantial progress in improving our contribution losses - a 30%  improvement over FY 2012 - while also launching a small market.  In Q1, we expect to continue this  progress and expect a contribution loss of ($42) million, a $15 million sequential improvement.    In Ireland, on January 10th, we increased our monthly subscription price for new members by one Euro  from €6.99 to €7.99, bringing Ireland pricing in line with our other Euro-zone countries.  Existing  members in Ireland received two-year grandfathering of their existing €6.99 pricing.  Because of this  grandfathering, there will be no material revenue impact from this change in 2014.  It’s too early to tell  if this change will materially affect our growth in Ireland.      We plan later this year to embark on a substantial European expansion.  Our success this year in  international net additions and shrinking contribution losses confirms our belief that there is a big  international opportunity for Netflix.     Content  We continued to expand our original content offerings in the quarter, launching a second season of  Lilyhammer starring Steven Van Zandt, the first five episodes of our first original animated series for  4  kids, Turbo F.A.S.T., from DreamWorks Animation, original standup comedy specials featuring Aziz  Ansari and Russell Peters and the original documentary The Short Game.    So far, Netflix original series have received over 80 major award nominations and wins, including Emmy  and Golden Globe recognition of House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Arrested Development and  Hemlock Grove.  House of Cards and Orange is the New Black were also included in the American Film  Institute’s list of the best 10 TV series of the year.  Our recently launched original documentary The  Square was also just nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.  We could not be  more pleased with -- and proud of -- our first slate of original content.     Timed for family viewing over the holidays, Turbo F.A.S.T has been very popular with kids around the  world, performing especially strong throughout Latin America.  As we had hoped, the global theatrical  and home video release of the DreamWorks Animation film based on the same characters helped  position the series for success.  Though just launched, Turbo F.A.S.T. is on track to become one of the  most popular kids series ever on Netflix.     The second season of Lilyhammer was our first ever for a Netflix original series. The show is finding a  broader audience, as we have introduced new English speaking characters and more global storylines.  Season 3 has recently begun production in Norway and the creators again plan to add characters that  will further broaden the appeal of this already very international show.     In 2014, we anticipate building on our tremendous momentum with new seasons of House of Cards  (Feb. 14th), Derek, Hemlock Grove, Orange is the New Black, Lilyhammer, and a fully exclusive, final  season of The Killing; as well as additional episodes of Turbo F.A.S.T., and premiere launches of our first  original animated series for adults, BoJack Horseman, and an epic series based on the adventures of  Marco Polo from The Weinstein Co., and additional new kids series from DreamWorks Animation.       We’re also thrilled to continue to bring high quality documentaries exclusively to our members. In  addition to The Square, later this week we’ll globally release MITT, the Gala premiere opening film at the  Sundance Film Festival this year.     Looking into early 2015, we anticipate the release of the first season of Sense8 from the Wachowski  siblings and J. Michael Straczynski, the as-yet unnamed project from the creators of Damages, and  Daredevil, the first series from our recently announced deal with Marvel Television.     Beyond our fully original series, Netflix will exclusively premiere new episodes of Better Call Saul, the  hotly anticipated spin-off of Breaking Bad in the UK and Ireland, throughout Latin America, the Nordics  and the Netherlands. Those episodes will premiere in North America on Netflix following their run on  AMC.  As part of that deal, we expanded and extended our exclusive deal for the entire Breaking Bad  series to all of our territories. The final 8 episodes of the now iconic show will hit Netflix in North  America on Feb. 24th.  Breaking Bad has proven to be a global success for us and we expect Better Call  Saul to be very popular with our members as well.  5  Marketing  In the US we launched in late November a new holiday campaign called “It Just Might Bring Everyone  Together”. The ad is simple and timely and positions Netflix as a part of the holiday/family experience.      We made steady progress in our international marketing efforts this quarter. We launched a new  campaign in Brazil introducing Netflix to a broader audience with positive results in terms of brand  awareness and familiarity of the attributes of our service. We also launched a new advertising campaign  in Canada over the holidays that played into the deep Canadian affection for hockey.    Product  We ended 2013 with our best product ever and one substantially better than a year ago.  Notably during  Q4, we rolled out our new user-interface for TV devices, a material step forward not only objectively in  terms of engagement metrics, but in terms of press and public attention. This user interface is coupled  with our new technology platform for TV devices, which has a smaller footprint and is higher  performing, allowing us to reach lower-powered devices and enabling future growth into new areas.    During the quarter, we also completed the roll out of the Netflix streaming application into Virgin  Media’s set-top box for UK members and have been quite pleased with the implementation and  reception.  We followed up with two similar platforms based on the same technology, Denmark’s Waoo!  which went live in Q4, and Com Hem in Sweden, which was just recently launched.  We anticipate rolling  out our first domestic MVPD integrations soon with some of the smaller MVPDs.      At CES this year, we promoted Ultra High Definition (UHD) 4K technology with several key consumer  electronics partners, announcing that House of Cards season 2 will be in 4K as well as all 5 seasons of  Breaking Bad, and our future original series. 4K streams are encoded at 15.6Mbps, well within reach of a  significant minority of our members, and the reach of capable 20Mbps broadband connections will  continue to grow.  Since the number of 4K displays sold in 2014 and the number of available hours of 4K  content both will be relatively modest, the short-term impact of 4K is mainly on consumer perception of  Netflix as a leader in Internet TV.    We continue to invest in personalization for content discovery, which adds value to our content catalogs  by presenting more relevant content to each user, driving more hours of viewing and better retention.   In January, we received our second Emmy Award for Technical Achievement in recognition of our  personalization technology.      6  Net Neutrality  Unfortunately, Verizon successfully challenged the U.S. net neutrality rules.  In principle, a domestic ISP  now can legally impede the video streams that members request from Netflix, degrading the experience  we jointly provide. The motivation could be to get Netflix to pay fees to stop this degradation.  Were this  draconian scenario to unfold with some ISP, we would vigorously protest and encourage our members  to demand the open Internet they are paying their ISP to deliver.     The most likely case, however, is that ISPs will avoid this consumer-unfriendly path of discrimination.   ISPs are generally aware of the broad public support for net neutrality and don’t want to galvanize  government action.       Moreover, ISPs have very profitable broadband businesses they want to expand. Consumers purchase  higher bandwidth packages mostly for one reason: high-quality streaming video.  ISPs appear to  recognize this and many of them are working closely with us and other streaming video services to  enable the ISPs subscribers to more consistently get the high-quality streaming video consumers desire.    In the long-term, we think Netflix and consumers are best served by strong network neutrality across all  networks, including wireless.  To the degree that ISPs adhere to a meaningful voluntary code of conduct,  less regulation is warranted. To the degree that some aggressive ISPs start impeding specific data flows,  more regulation would clearly be needed.       DVD  6.9 million DVD members continue to value the tremendous selection we offer on DVD.      Contribution profit was roughly stable at $110 million.  We expect $98 million in contribution profit for  Q1, which reflects the postal rate increase implemented this month and higher seasonal usage.         In the coming months, we’ll begin using dvd.netflix.com on our envelopes and on the DVD web pages.  The dvd.netflix.com logo will feature our iconic envelope in a nod to our DVD-by-mail heritage,  representing the huge selection that DVD offers; nearly every movie ever made.       Free Cash Flow and Capital  Free cash flow was $5 million in Q4 compared to $48 million of net income, mostly due to cash spending  on content being higher than P&L expense.  While our cash and equivalents has risen to $1.2 billion, we  anticipate embarking on substantially more international expansion and originals funding over the next  few years.  Given the current favorable interest rate environment, we think a prudent step in Q1 is to  7  raise an additional $400 million of long-term debt on terms similar to our $500 million raise last year.  At  $900 million of total long term debt, we will have an extremely modest debt to equity ratio.       Business Outlook  Starting this quarter we are providing you our internal forecast numbers for the quarter in the table at  the beginning of this letter.  This internal forecast is based upon the first few weeks of the quarter, the  historical pattern and other factors.  This is our raw internal best-guess forecast, so we should land  above it sometimes and below it sometimes.      Our goal in this modest change of communication is to increase transparency and to simplify our  message.      Summary  It’s been a good year for Netflix.  People around the world want what we offer: consumer-in-control  Internet television.     Sincerely,                                                                                         Reed Hastings, CEO               David Wells, CFO                8  Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Interview  Reed Hastings, David Wells and Ted Sarandos will participate in a live video interview at 2 p.m. Pacific  Time at youtube.com/netflixir.

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it  measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, this non-GAAP measure should  be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is  contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding domestic contribution margin targets; pricing structure  and changes; expansion into new geographic markets and the impact of international expansion;  investments in content and content offerings, including original content; impact of technology  developments such as 4K and growth of high speed broadband connections; impacts relating to net  neutrality; business outlook for our DVD segment, including contribution profit; obtaining additional  capital; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue,  contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and  international operations, as well as consolidated net income and earnings per share for the first quarter  of 2014. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could  cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new  members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion  9  of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in  service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our  service; competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed  entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013.  The Company provides internal forecast  numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers  based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                   10 Netflix, Inc.

       " 'Q416ShareholderLetter': \"Fellow shareholders,    In 2016, we generated $8.3 billion in global streaming revenue (35% y/y growth) and finished the year  with 93.8 million members on 19.0 million net additions vs. 17.4 million in 2015.

Operating profit totaled $154 million (6.2% operating  margin) against guidance of $125 million, while net income amounted to $67 million, compared with our  forecast of $56 million. Net income included a -$22 million foreign exchange adjustment booked in other  expense due to the strength of the US dollar. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our  actual internal forecast at the time we report.   We added 7.05 million net new members globally in the quarter, against our forecast of 5.20 million and  last year's Q4 performance of 5.59 million. This was the largest quarter of net additions in our history  and was driven by strong acquisition trends in both our US and International segments.   Domestically, we added 1.93 million members in the quarter, exceeding our forecast of 1.45 million and  1.56 million in the year-ago quarter. Combined with 15% ASP growth, revenue increased 27% year-over  -year to $1.4 billion. US contribution margin expanded 395 basis points year-over-year to 38.2%. Margin  improvement was greater than expected due primarily to higher-than-forecast revenue and the timing  of content deals.  International membership grew by 5.12 million in Q4, against a forecast of 3.75 million and 4.04 million  in the year-ago quarter. Over 47% of our total members are now outside of the US. This growth was very  broad based geographically as our original content continues to be well-received all over the world. ASP  for the international segment rose 13% year over year (excluding a -$21 million impact from currency).  International contribution loss was -$67 million, compared with our forecast of -$75 million, as content  spend was slightly lower than expected owing primarily to timing.  In Q1, we project 5.2 million net adds with 1.5 million in the US and 3.7 million internationally. Our  anticipation for a year-over-year decline in domestic net adds reflects a difficult comparison in the year  ago quarter where we exceeded our net adds forecast by 27%. Similarly, in our international segment,  we will lap our Rest of World launch in January of last year. We also expect a greater membership  impact from our content slate in the second half of 2017. On a sequential basis, we believe our strong  Q4 results likely pulled forward some net adds from Q1’17 to Q4’16.   Since our global expansion is proceeding well, we intend to grow our global operating margin for many  years ahead. We’ve been around a 4% annual operating margin for the past two years, and we are  targeting about 7% for the full year 2017 based on current F/X rates.  From here, we will seek to steadily  increase revenue and operating margin as we balance growth and profitability. We are in no rush to  push margins up too quickly, as we want to ensure we are investing aggressively enough to continue to  lead internet TV around the world. In Q1, we are forecasting a 9% operating margin, higher than our full  year target due to the timing of content spend, including moving \\u200bHouse of Cards\\u200b season 5 from Q1 to  Q2.     2  We anticipate the international segment will be slightly contribution profit positive in Q1. We plan on  investing over the remaining quarters of 2017 internationally and, as a result, anticipate an international  contribution loss in Q2. On a full year basis, we expect  international contribution loss to improve  substantially year on year.   Content  We are learning rapidly how best to match content with audience tastes around the world.  It is clear to  us that high quality content travels well across borders. For instance, our global originals like \\u200bMarvel’s  Luke Cage\\u200b, \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b and season 3 of \\u200bBlack Mirror\\u200b continue to generate excitement and excellent  viewing all across the world. Similarly, \\u200bGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\\u200b debuted in the top 10 in every  territory. Guillermo Del Toro’s \\u200bTrollhunters\\u200b,\\u200b \\u200bl\\u200ba\\u200bu\\u200bn\\u200bc\\u200bh\\u200be\\u200bd\\u200b \\u200bi\\u200bn\\u200b \\u200bD\\u200be\\u200bc\\u200be\\u200bm\\u200bb\\u200be\\u200br\\u200b, is tracking to be our most-watched  kids original and is performing particularly well in our newer territories. We closed the quarter with the  release of \\u200bThe OA\\u200b, a mind-bending, multi-layered supernatural drama that is a great example of the  bold, creative storytelling we’ve aimed to support.   Gratifyingly, our first \\u200bBrazilian original series \\u200b3%\\u200b, a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic thriller, premiered as one of  the most watched originals in Brazil and played well throughout Latin America. Moreover, bucking  conventional wisdom, millions of US members have watched the show dubbed and subtitled into  English, making \\u200b3%\\u200b the first Portuguese language television show to travel meaningfully beyond Latin  America and Portugal.   We continue to invest in local programming to complement our content offering and as a means to  introduce new members to our global library. We are focusing on local content that travels  pan-regionally or across multiple territories, such as Japanese anime and Turkish dramas. In this vein, we  announced a long-term deal with Red Chillies Entertainment, the film production company of Shah Rukh  Khan, who is considered by many to be the \\u200bbiggest movie star\\u200b on the planet. Netflix is now the exclusive  global home for Khan’s new films and members will enjoy exclusive SVOD access to dozens of popular  Red Chillies films from the past several years.  It’s amazing to think that we launched original programming on Netflix in 2013 and in just four years,  our original series accounted for \\u200bfive of the top 10 most searched TV shows of 2016 globally\\u200b, including  Stranger Things\\u200b at #1, according to \\u200bGoogle trends\\u200b. On January 8, we were honored that \\u200bThe Crown  received the Golden Globe Award for Best TV Series (Drama), while Claire Foy won the award for Best  Performance by an Actress in a TV Series (Drama) for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II. Later this  month, \\u200bThe Screen Actors Guild Awards\\u200b, the most widely voted-on major awards for TV and films, will  feature eight individual Netflix original series with 17 nominations, the most of any network.   We are incredibly excited about all the projects we have underway for our global members, no matter  their age, taste or cultural background;  in 2017, we plan to invest over $6 billion on content on a P&L  basis (up from $5 billion in 2016).         3  Product and Partnerships  In Q4, we launched offline viewing, which allows members to download content to iOS and Android  devices. Our goal is to make Netflix as accessible as possible to members in countries and locations (such  as subways and airplanes) with limited and/or expensive bandwidth. We are pleased with the initial  results and, as expected, enjoyment of offline viewing is greatest in emerging markets, where the  broadband infrastructure is less robust. In Q4 we also launched on Comcast’s X1 set-top boxes, and the  integration has pleased our members who now can use their X1 remote control and user interface to  access Netflix as they do their other TV networks.   Net Neutrality  Weakening of US net neutrality laws, should that occur, is unlikely to materially affect our domestic  margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our  relationships with ISPs stable.   On a public policy basis, however, strong net neutrality is important to support innovation and smaller  firms. No one wants ISPs to decide what new and potentially disruptive services can operate over their  networks, or to favor one service over another. We hope the new US administration and Congress will  recognize that keeping the network neutral drives job growth and innovation.   Competition  Internet video is a global phenomenon. Amazon Prime Video expanded recently to match our territory  footprint, while YouTube remains far larger than either of us in terms of global video enjoyment  minutes. Video consumption is growing on Facebook, and Apple is rumored to be adding video to its  music service.  Satellite TV operators are moving to become internet MVPDs, such as ViaSat to ViaPlay in  the Nordics, DISH to Sling, and DirecTV to DirecTV Now. Insurgent firms such as Molotov.tv in France and  Hulu are building native-internet interfaces for TV network bundles. CBS is releasing a major original  series (\\u200bStar Trek\\u200b) exclusively on its domestic SVOD service (with us as international partner).  Finally, the  BBC \\u200bhas become\\u200b the first major linear network to announce plans to go binge-first with new seasons,  favoring internet over linear viewers. We presume HBO is not far behind the BBC. In short, it’s becoming  an internet TV world, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Netflix as we strive to earn  screen time.   Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Q4 free cash flow totaled -$639 million vs. -$276 million last Q4 and -$506 million in Q3’16. The  sequential increase was largely due to the timing of content payments, including our growing slate of  self-produced originals. Producing more owned content creates some lumpiness in our working capital  needs. We expect our FCF to be around -$2 billion in 2017 vs. -$1.7 billion in 2016, with FCF loss  improving sequentially in Q1’17.    4  We are funding our working capital needs through the debt market. In October, we raised $1 billion of  senior notes with a coupon of 4.375%, which will reduce our weighted average cost of capital. We will  continue to be a regular issuer of debt to finance our investment in original content as we balance our  cash needs with the carrying cost of interest expense.   Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: \\u200bOctober 2016\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2016\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2016\\u200b,  January, 2016\\u200b, \\u200bOctober 2015\\u200b, \\u200bJuly 2015\\u200b, \\u200bApril 2015\\u200b, \\u200bJanuary 2015\\u200b.      Summary  In 2016, we launched globally (excluding China) and made good progress. But there remains a lot to  learn to make Netflix as popular abroad as it is in the US.

IR Contact:        Spencer Wang    Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations    408 809-5360      PR Contact:    Jonathan Friedland  Chief Communications Officer    310 734-2958     Use of Non-GAAP Measures\\xa0 This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-\\u200bGAAP financial measure of net  income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax reserves, and to free cash flow and EBITDA.  Management believes that the non\\u200b-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the  amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these  non\\u200b-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-\\u200bGAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.  5    Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0 This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding the acquisition impact of our content slate; growth of  internet TV; impacts on our business from competition; localization efforts; content strategy, including  local content, original and licensed content investments; impacts of changes to net neutrality laws; ratio  of cash spending on content to P&L spend; future capital raises; domestic and international net, total  and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic  (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating  margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow.

Internationally, our  forecast was low, and actuals came in slightly ahead (18.28A versus 17.99F).  To remind everyone, the  quarterly forecast we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report.      On an absolute basis (as opposed to relative to forecast), US net adds are down compared to one year  ago (1.9 million this Q4 versus 2.3 million for Q4 2013).   In October, we judged the leading factor of the  similar decline in Q3 y/y net adds to be our May price change.  Since then, with additional research, we  now think that the decline in y/y net adds would have largely taken place independent of the price  change.  We’ve found our growth in net adds is strongest in the lower income areas of the US, which  would not be the case if there was material price sensitivity.   Additionally, we implemented a similar  price change in Mexico during Q4, and saw no detectable change in net additions.       We think, instead, the reduction in y/y net additions is a natural progression in our large US market as  we grow.  We have built in flexibility to our business model in terms of how quickly we grow content and  marketing spend, so we intend to keep US contribution margins growing even with lower membership  growth.  This year we plan to increase US contribution margins from 30% in Q1 to about 32% in Q1 2016  to about 34% in Q1 2017, etc.  We’ll re-evaluate the margin progression model again in early 2020 when  we hopefully achieve 40% contribution margins.      It is increasingly clear that virtually all entertainment video will be Internet video in the future.   We  believe there is big growth ahead in the US market for Netflix, even if we may not get there in a straight  line of 6 million annual net adds.   We’ll continue to improve our content, our marketing and our service,  to eventually achieve “must have” status in most households.     Our international segment is growing very nicely with net adds of 2.43 million members in Q4,  compared to 1.74 million a year ago.  Our initial set of markets (Canada, Latin America, the UK, Ireland,  the Nordic countries and the Netherlands) achieved contribution profitability in Q3 and continue to  grow.   Our launch in Q3 in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg went well  and our new original content is particularly popular.   With all of the additional new original content set  to premiere in 2015, it will be a big year for us in France, Germany and our other recently launched  markets.   We’ve successfully built big demand for Netflix from Argentina to Finland, due in part to the  overall shift from linear to Internet TV.      In late Q1, we’ll be launching Netflix in Australia and New Zealand.  There are numerous local  competitors and a thirst for movies and TV shows from around the world.  Later in the year, we’ll launch  additional major countries, in keeping with our global strategy.                            3  Our international expansion strategy over the last few years has been to expand as fast as we can while  staying profitable on a global basis.   Progress has been so strong that we now believe we can complete  our global expansion over the next two years, while staying profitable, which is earlier than we  expected.  We then intend to generate material global profits from 2017 onwards.  We already offer Netflix in about 50 countries and have learned a great deal about the content people  prefer, the marketing they respond to and how to best organize ourselves for steady improvement.  Acceleration to 200 countries is largely made possible by the tremendous growth of the Internet in  general, including on phones, tablets and smart TVs.  We intend to stick to our core ad-free subscription  model.  As with our initial round of international expansion, we’ll get some things wrong and do our best  to fix them quickly.   For most countries we have a good idea of the best approach for Netflix to take.   For China, we are still  exploring options — all of them modest.  We’ll learn a great deal if we can successfully operate a small  service in China centered on our original and other globally-licensed content.  That is our preference, for  the next few years, if we are able to acquire the necessary permissions.    It is advantageous for Netflix to become global in many ways.  The big one is absolute size (faster to  $10B in revenue) because that revenue allows us to develop and license more content for our members  and improve our service.  A second is being able to source great stories from around the world and  deliver them to the world.   A third is the efficiency and influence of being a unique global licensor that  provides worldwide distribution.  With the growth of the Internet over the next 20 years, there will be some amazing entertainment  services available globally.  We intend to be one of the leaders.    Content  Looking at our original content performance over the last few years, there have been so many  impressive aspects:  how this effort, begun in 2012, has improved perceptions of the Netflix brand; how  we’ve had a good start with 45 Emmy, 10 Golden Globe and two Academy Award nominations and  several wins in just two years; how success with one great creator leads to new opportunities for other  projects; how producing around the world with incredibly diverse talent is working for us; how much we  feel we are just scratching the surface.  But there is one real shocker; last year our original content  overall was some of our most efficient content.  Our originals cost us less money, relative to our  viewing metrics, than most of our licensed content, much of which is well known and created by the top  studios.   We will continue to grow the percentage of our content spending dedicated to originals for the next  several years.   This will mean more cash usage, which means more debt. We factor interest cost into our originals  budget as we try to make each project more efficient and effective than studio content we’d otherwise  be licensing.                        4  Marco Polo has struck a chord across all Netflix territories, generating substantial viewing over the  holiday season.  It has a 93% Audience rating from Rotten Tomatoes compared to  96% for House of  Cards and 96% for Game of Thrones for their first seasons.  They are all incredibly entertaining shows.   We intend to debut a second season of Marco Polo in 2016.   We are thrilled to offer exclusively the controversial comedy, The Interview, to our US and Canadian  members beginning this Saturday, Jan. 24 - just thirty days after it debuted in theaters and pay-per-view.   Our first original feature film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II: The Green Destiny, is now in post  production and will debut on August 26 in all of our markets.  We expect to open the film on select  IMAX screens the same day as its release on Netflix.  This year, we are launching 320 hours of original series (new and returning), films, documentaries and  stand-up comedy specials, triple the amount of original programming Netflix released in 2014. In Q1, we  are premiering Season Three of House of Cards, the new Tina Fey and Robert Carlock comedy The  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt starring Ellie Kemper and Bloodline, an intense family thriller from the  creators of Damages that stars Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, Norbert Leo Butz, Sissy  Spacek and Sam Shepard.   Our original documentary Virunga just secured our second back-to-back Academy Award nomination for  Best Documentary Feature and What Happened, Miss Simone?,  a look at the life of the legendary singer  Nina Simone, will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this week and at the Berlin Film Festival in  February.  Beginning this quarter, and in current Netflix territories outside the US and Canada, Netflix will be the  exclusive home of Better Call Saul,  Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad prequel that focuses on attorney Saul  Goodman (Bob Odenkirk).  In many territories outside of the UK, we just premiered the second season  of the critically acclaimed British drama, The Fall with Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan.    For an overall view of our original content slate and upcoming premiere dates, please click here  Product  We have continued to deliver a variety of algorithmic and data improvements that put better choices in  front of members.  We are also pioneering offering new high-quality video formats, delivering UHD-4K  for House of Cards and Marco Polo. Soon we will be offering High Dynamic Range video (HDR) which  captures and renders pictures with more realistic peak brightness in the highlights, and may be a more  significant step forward in viewing pleasure than UHD-4K.  We will start building our library to deliver in  HDR as new TVs become available from several manufacturers this year.  Having supported the vast majority of Smart TV devices with a Netflix app, we are now turning our  attention to more operator devices and set-top boxes. Following our success with Virgin Media in the  UK, we have added British Telecom and TalkTalk on the YouView STB in the UK, Deutsche Telecom STBs  in Germany, Bouygues, SFR,  and Orange STBs in France, Proximus in Belgium, and DISH STBs in the US.   The BT and Orange partnerships include a new payment capability, similar to what we offer on AppleTV.                       5  Members can elect for BT/Orange to bill on our behalf and the appeal of a single bill seems to be  attractive.  Marketing  Each quarter a greater percentage of our marketing dollars is spent promoting our exclusive content as  we believe it is the best way to drive consumer demand for Netflix. Our biggest campaign in Q4 was for  Marco Polo, which we launched globally in early December. Separately, our highly targeted campaign  behind the Netflix original documentary Virunga is continuing into Q1 with its Oscar nomination.   In Q4, we also executed more modest campaigns behind King Julien to spur family viewing over the  holidays and shared a moment of Netflix love with our Airport commercial timed to Thanksgiving travel  in the US.  Looking forward, we are launching campaigns for The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline,  Better Call Saul (internationally) and Season 3 of House of Cards.  We were pleased last week on the release of the YouGov Brand Index showing US brands with the most  positive buzz, with Netflix at #3, up from #12 in 2013 and another indicator of how our brand is  continuing to build momentum.  Strong Net Neutrality  People around the world increasingly view Internet access as a necessary utility -- Finland even made  fast Internet access a legal right.  Recently President Obama echoed the same themes in his call for the  FCC to take bold steps to be able to ensure a low-cost high-speed Internet.  The support for strong net  neutrality continues to grow.    Competition  There is no news yet on timing or price of HBO’s expansion of a direct-to-consumer model to the US.    Their Nordics’ offer is priced about the same as Netflix but the content offering includes only HBO and  other original series, and not the breadth of movie content HBO offers in the US.     Verizon and Redbox shut down their Netflix streaming competitor after about one year of operation.     CBS launched its CBS All Access streaming service which, like Hulu, has commercial interruptions.    Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Yahoo are all increasing their original programming efforts.  Shomi and CraveTV launched in Canada. In many of our international markets, we face competition from  both stand alone OTT services (Clarovideo in Mexico, for instance) and ones associated with incumbent  broadcasters (CanalPlay in France).  In Australia we will face strong competition this year, and look  forward to getting started later this quarter.    Piracy continues to be one of our biggest competitors.  This graph of Popcorn Time’s sharp rise relative  to Netflix and HBO in the Netherlands, for example, is sobering.                         6  MVPDs around the world are moving as they can to on-demand cloud-DVR models.  Dish and Sony are  launching “Internet MVPD” services.    In general, Internet TV is going mainstream, which both increases the size of the market and brings new  competitors.   It couldn’t be a more exciting time in our industry!  DVD  Our DVD-by-mail service in the US continues to delight 5.8 million members, adding $89 million in  contribution profit in Q4.  The comprehensive selection of titles available on DVD and Blu-ray includes  new release films, major TV shows (including HBO and Showtime series) and much more.   Global Expenses, Income & Tax Rate  On a pro-forma basis (without the tax reserve release described below) net income would have been  $45 million, compared to a forecast of $27 million, due to lower than expected international losses and  tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the 2014 R&D tax credit (independent of the tax reserve  release).    Our global technology and general and administrative costs increased year on year in support of  continued international and content expansion.  Our Q1 guidance reflects a sequential increase in these  costs primarily related to adjustments in annual market compensation.   In Q4, we resolved certain prior year tax audits, primarily related to R&D tax credits, resulting in the  release of $39 million in reserves from the prior open tax periods.  We also expect a favorable effect on  our future effective tax rate of around 2% due to a lowered reserve rate on the R&D credit going  forward.  Because of our international expansion plans for 2015, we expect full year operating income for 2015 to  be lower than full year 2014.    Free Cash Flow & Capital  We finished the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents.  Given we are investing faster in  content (this Q1 will show a step up in cash use with all the original projects launching in the quarter)  and the current favorable interest rate environment, we intend to raise at least a billion dollars, pending  market conditions, of additional long-term debt in a similar manner to last year.    Over the next few years we expect to continue financing our original content expansion with long-term  debt.  As long as the maturities are spread out, and the interest cost is built into our content budgets,  we think long-term debt is the best way for Netflix to finance the production of content.  7  Reference  For quick reference, our eight most recent investor letters are: October 2014, July 2014,   April 2014,  January 2014, October 2013, July 2013, April 2013, January 2013.  Summary Congratulations to Kevin Spacey for winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series  for House of Cards.

Management  believes that the non-GAAP measures of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the release of tax  reserves provides useful information as these measures exclude benefits that are not indicative of our  core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric  because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt  obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However, these non-GAAP measures  should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income,  diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures  are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.     Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding international expansion and performance, US  contribution margin and domestic performance, spending on original content, global expansion and  profitability, product improvements, operating expenses, cash flow and debt financing, member growth  domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid, revenue, contribution profit (loss) and  contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as  consolidated operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking  statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events  to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members;  our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for instant streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in- home filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could                      9  cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in  our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2014.  The Company provides internal  forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast  numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We  undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.                                                                                                                                                              10 Netflix, Inc.

Our summary results and Q1 forecast are below.           1  Q4 Results and Q1 Forecast  In the fourth quarter, we added a record 5.59 million members as our big shows such as \\u200bNarcos\\u200b and  Marvel’s Jessica Jones\\u200b helped us grow membership to 74.76 million.  This 5.59 million compares to a  forecast of 5.15 million and to prior year net additions of 4.33 million.   For Q1, we are forecasting 6.10  million net additions vs. prior year of 4.88 million. On earnings, we stayed profitable in Q4 despite  foreign exchange headwinds, and delivered operating income of $60m and net income of $43m. We  expect similar modest operating income results for Q1, assuming current foreign exchange, as we invest  in our international expansion.  As a reminder, the guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at  the time we report, and we strive for accuracy in our guidance.    In September, we launched in Japan, followed by Spain, Portugal and Italy in October. We are very  pleased with the first few months of membership growth in these markets. Our international  contribution loss of $109 million in Q4 increased sequentially due to these launches. We anticipate Q1  international losses of about $114 million.     In early January at CES, we announced the availability of Netflix everywhere in the world except China.  Pricing is comparable to our existing plans and we have added support for Korean, Arabic, and Simplified  & Traditional Chinese languages. Our move into 130 additional countries broadens our addressable  market by 190 million broadband homes, on top of the 360 million we counted at the end of 2015 .  1 While the opportunity is large, our growth in these new markets will unfold over many years as we  improve our service. We are starting by primarily targeting outward-looking, affluent consumers with  international credit cards and smartphones.  As with every market we’ve launched, our approach is to  listen, learn and improve rapidly, adding more content, additional languages and a better Netflix  experience over time. Our global availability sets us up for continued growth for many years and we  continue to expect material global profits beginning in 2017.     In Q4, average subscriber price grew 4-5% y/y around the world, excluding the impact of foreign  currency (-$106 million y/y impact on revenue). In the US it was 4.3%, leading to 21% year over year  growth in streaming revenue.  We are seeing increased adoption of our Ultra-HD plan ($11.99) as more  UHD TVs are purchased and as we are a leading source of UHD content for consumers.     In the US, we ended 2015 with nearly 45 million members, although our Q4 US net adds were down year  over year, as expected (1.56m actual versus 1.90m prior year). Our high penetration in the US seems to  be making net additions harder than in the past. Our forecast for Q1 US net additions is 1.75m, against a  prior year actual of 2.28m.  New credit/debit card rollover continues to be a background issue.  In Q2  and Q3, we’ll be releasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering on the HD  plan and they will have the option of continuing at $7.99 but now on the SD plan, or continuing on HD at  $9.99 a month. Given these members have been with us at least 2 years, we expect only slightly  elevated churn. Our 2020 US contribution target remains at 40% and we are already at 34%.     1 Source: SNL Kagan and Euromonitor.  2  In the last remaining major market, China, we have work and uncertainty ahead. We are building  relationships, understanding the market, and seeking the conditions we require to provide our service to  entertainment lovers there. Our expectations are modest and long-term. We may be able to get started  this year and thus deliver on “whole world by end of 2016” or it may take longer. Most of our focus is on  the 130 countries we launched on January 6, which are now embracing Netflix as a new entertainment  option.     Content  In Q4 ‘15, we launched an unprecedented number of  original series and films, while maintaining a high  bar on quality. We unveiled five new original series in Q4, including \\u200bMarvel’s Jessica Jones\\u200b and \\u200bMaster of  None\\u200b, starring Aziz Ansari. Both combined with \\u200bNarcos, Sense8, Marvel’s Daredevil\\u200b and \\u200bBloodline\\u200b to  claim six of the \\u200bTop 10 new TV shows of 2015\\u200b according to IMDB. In late December, we debuted a  ten-part documentary series \\u200bMaking a Murderer\\u200b, which has enthralled \\u200baudiences and critics\\u200b alike and  triggered a \\u200bnational conversation\\u200b on fairness of the American criminal justice system.    Our first original feature films also premiered in Q4. \\u200bBeasts of No Nation, \\u200ba gripping journey into the  world of African child soldiers from writer and director Cary Fukunaga and starring Idris Elba, was a  favorite of critics and has picked up several major awards nominations.  Adam Sandler’s first Netflix  original film \\u200bThe Ridiculous Six\\u200b, which debuted globally on December 11, was the most viewed movie on  Netflix in every territory the week of its debut and the most-viewed movie ever on Netflix in the first 30  days on service.  Two of our original documentaries, \\u200bWhat Happened, Miss Simone? \\u200band \\u200bWinter on Fire\\u200b,  are both nominated for Academy Awards, our third and fourth nominations in three years for best  documentary feature.     In 2016, we plan to launch over 600 hours of original programming, up from about 450 hours in 2015.  Beyond the sheer volume of content, the breadth of our original programming will continue to expand  with current plans for new seasons of 30 or so original series (including \\u200bThe Crown\\u200b and \\u200bThe Get Down\\u200b),  eight original feature films, 35 new seasons of  original series for kids, a dozen documentaries, and nine  stand up comedy specials.     We are now in our fourth year of original programming and we are putting special emphasis on shows  that families can enjoy together, including the upcoming \\u200bFuller House, \\u200bnew seasons of \\u200bUnbreakable  Kimmy Schmidt, \\u200band \\u200bStranger Things. \\u200bWe are also stepping up our non-English language original  productions, including \\u200bMarseille, \\u200ba French political drama starring Gerard Depardieu, and then, shows  from Italy, Japan, Mexico and Brazil. We expect some of these series to gain fans well beyond the  markets in which they were made.     Increasingly, our goal is to own more of our original programming to allow for greater creative and  business control and to ensure global access to content. We are currently actively managing productions  spanning the globe from Cambodia to Venice Beach.     3  The growth of Netflix has created some anxiety among TV networks and \\u200bcalls to be fearful\\u200b. Or, at the  other extreme, an NBC executive recently \\u200bsaid\\u200b Internet TV is overblown and that linear TV is \\u200b“TV like God  intended.”\\u200b Our investors are not as sure of God’s intentions for TV, and instead think that Internet TV is  a fundamentally better entertainment experience that will gain share for many years. The challenge for  traditional media companies, most of whom see the future pretty clearly, is to use the revenue from  Netflix and other SVOD services to fund both great content and their own evolution into Internet TV  networks. Seeso, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, CanalPlay, HBO Now, and CBS All Access are the beginnings of these  efforts.     Our titles are watched on the go and at home on a wide range of devices, making measurement of the  viewing of any given title difficult for third parties. We don’t release title-level ratings as our business  model is not dependent on advertising or affiliate fees. Instead, we release “ratings “ for Netflix as a  whole every quarter with our membership growth report (75 million and counting!). It is member  viewing and satisfaction that propels our growth.     Product  We have been innovating in support of our global launch, focusing on adding new languages, new  payment options and fine-tuning our algorithms for our growing number of content catalogs.  Additionally, this involves expanding and deepening our partnerships with device makers and mobile  and TV operators to reach and serve our members around the world.     We recognize that in some parts of the world, mobile is the primary way many people access the  Internet.  We are improving our mobile experience, including sign up, credentials & authentication, the  user interface, and streaming efficiency for cellular networks.     In Q4, we began rolling out \\u200bcomplexity based encoding\\u200b. By encoding videos based on the type of content  (a visually complex action movie vs. a simpler kids animated title, for example) rather than just based on  the amount of bandwidth available to a member, we can deliver higher resolution streams at lower bit  rates, resulting in bandwidth savings.     We have long used a blacklist to prevent cross-border content viewing via proxies and “unblockers.”  Recently, we have begun to use a new blacklist and other techniques, as are other SVOD services, as  desired by content licensors. Ultimately, our goal is to let members around the world enjoy all the  content we have through global licensing.    Marketing  Promoting high quality, exclusive titles continues to be the best driver of consumer demand for Netflix.  Our recent new market launches reflect this philosophy, and our all-digital, content-led marketing  approach is working. Our brand strength is rising in many \\u200bstudies\\u200b, including a #2 ranking reported in  AdWeek\\u200b for the USA. Around the world, our all digital approach makes us efficient and relevant to active  Internet users everywhere.   4  Competition  Our focus on “winning moments of truth” means that we compete with all of the activities that  consumers can engage in during their leisure time, such as reading a book, playing videogames,  watching linear TV, movie theatre-going, etc. Given the broad array of options, we are privileged that  our members around the world continue to devote more time to Netflix, streaming 42.5 billion hours in  2015, up from 29 billion hours in 2014.     In addition, looking at just the online segment, the most recent Sandvine data illustrates that our share  of peak North American downstream Internet traffic continues to grow. Please note that the  deployment of complexity based encoding, as described above, will result in what appears to be slower  growth in Netflix traffic in future third-party reports such as Sandvine (which measures peak megabits,  not peak viewing hours).        As we have said previously, Internet TV will likely have multiple winners as the various services are not  direct substitutes for each other given differing sets of content. A closer look at the Sandvine data shows  that the entire Over-the-Top category is growing as consumers increasingly embrace Internet TV and on  demand viewing and, even better, this growth is coming at the expense of piracy.   5    Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure  Free cash flow amounted to -$276 million in Q4 and -$921 million for the full year 2015. As a reminder,  our investment in originals, particularly owned content, requires more cash upfront relative to licensed  content, which will continue to dampen free cash flow.  We finished Q4 with debt of $2.4 billion,  unchanged from the prior quarter, and with cash & equivalents and short-term investments of $2.3  billion.     Given our expected cash needs, we are likely to raise additional debt in late 2016 or early 2017.  We are  managing our balance sheet to lower our blended cost of capital over time, while maintaining financial  flexibility. Despite being FCF negative as we grow our original content and invest in international, our  bonds trade like a BB credit (vs. their single B rating) due, in part, to the long-term growth of Internet TV  globally and our low debt to market cap ratio, which provides bond investors with a very thick cushion of  protection.     DVD  Our DVD-by-mail business in the US continues to serve more than 4.9 million members.  We are pleased  that our DVD business is managing the decline well, despite increasing postal costs, generating $80  million in contribution profit in Q4.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis excluding the  release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that are not  indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are  7  important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated  that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities.  However,  these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net  income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or  other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of  these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial  statements.    Forward-Looking Statements  This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding growth of international markets; expansion to China;  churn related to price changes; volume and titles of future content offerings; original content strategy;  growth of internet TV; raising capital; member growth domestically and internationally, including net,  total and paid; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming  and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, net income, earnings  per share and free cash flow. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and  uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our  ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively;  maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our  service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet Service Providers; and, competition,  including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment.  A detailed  discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ  materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on January 29, 2015.  The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should  anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and  uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to  update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this  shareholder letter.      8                                                                                                                                                          9 Netflix, Inc.

       "\" \\n \\n1 \\nApril 23rd, 2012    \\nDear Fellow Shareholders, \\nNetflix added nearly 3 million streaming members in Q1, bringing our total to over 26 million global \\nstreaming members, and strengthening our position as the world’s leading Internet TV network.   We \\nanticipate returning to global profitability in Q2, and plan to launch our next international market in Q4.   \\nWe are constantly improving our service with better personalization, better user-interfaces, better \\nstreaming, and more content.  As a result, per-member viewing hours set new records in Q1 and are on \\ntrack to do so again in Q2, on a year-over-year basis.  We launched our service in the UK and Ireland in \\nJanuary and are very pleased that, after the first 90 days, we had substantially more members than we \\nhad after the first 90 days of Canada or Latin America.       \\n \\n (in millions except per share data)\\nQ2 '10\\nQ3 '10\\nQ4 '10\\nQ1 '11\\nQ2 '11\\nQ3 '11\\nQ4 '11\\nQ1 '12 \\nG id\\n \\nDomestic Streaming:\\nNet Subscription Additions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n0.22\\n1.74\\nTotal Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n21.45\\n21.67\\n23.41\\nPaid Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n20.51\\n20.15\\n22.02\\nRevenue\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -   $       476  $       507 \\nContribution Profit\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -   $         52  $         67 \\nContribution Margin\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n10.9%\\n13.2%\\nInternational Streaming:\\nNet Subscription Additions\\n -  \\n0.13\\n0.38\\n0.29\\n0.16\\n0.51\\n0.38\\n1.21\\nTotal Subscriptions\\n -  \\n0.13\\n0.51\\n0.80\\n0.97\\n1.48\\n1.86\\n3.07\\nPaid Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n0.33\\n0.67\\n0.86\\n0.99\\n1.45\\n2.41\\nRevenue\\n -   $          -    $           4  $         12  $         19  $         23  $         29  $         43 \\nContribution Profit (Loss)\\n -   $          (3)  $          (9)  $        (11)  $          (9)  $        (23)  $        (60)  $      (103)\\nDomestic DVD:\\nNet Subscription Additions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n(2.76)\\n(1.08)\\nTotal Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n13.93\\n11.17\\n10.09\\nPaid Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n13.81\\n11.04\\n9.96\\nRevenue\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -   $       370  $       320 \\nContribution Profit\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -   $       194  $       146 \\nContribution Margin\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n52.4%\\n45.6%\\nTotal Domestic (Streaming + DVD, for historical comparison):\\nRevenue\\n $       520  $       553  $       592  $       706  $       770  $       799  $       847  $       826 \\nY/Y Change\\n27%\\n31%\\n33%\\n43%\\n48%\\n44%\\n43%\\n17%\\nContribution Profit\\n $       130  $       130  $       152  $       187  $       213  $       219  $       246  $       213 \\nY/Y Change\\n40%\\n46%\\n55%\\n68%\\n64%\\n68%\\n62%\\n14%\\nGlobal:\\nRevenue\\n $       520  $       553  $       596  $       719  $       789  $       822  $       876  $       870 \\nY/Y Change\\n27%\\n31%\\n34%\\n46%\\n52%\\n49%\\n47%\\n21%\\nNet Income (Loss)\\n $         44  $         38  $         47  $         60  $         68  $         62  $         35  $          (5)\\nY/Y Change\\n38%\\n27%\\n52%\\n88%\\n55%\\n63%\\n-26%\\nNM\\nEPS\\n $      0.80  $      0.70  $      0.87  $      1.11  $      1.26  $      1.16  $      0.64  $     (0.08)\\nY/Y Change\\n48%\\n35%\\n55%\\n88%\\n58%\\n66%\\n-26%\\nNM\\nFree Cash Flow\\n $         34  $           8  $         51  $         79  $         60  $         14  $         34  $           2 \\nBuyback\\n $         45  $         57 \\n $          -    $       109  $         51  $         40 \\n $          -    $          -   \\nShares (FD)\\n54.3\\n53.9\\n54.2\\n54.2\\n53.9\\n53.9\\n55.4\\n55.5\\n\""
