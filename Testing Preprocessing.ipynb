       "{'FINAL-Q2-23-Shareholder-Letter': \"In May, we successfully launched paid sharing in 100+ countries, representing more than 80% of our revenue base. ○ Revenue in each region is now higher than pre-launch, with sign-ups already exceeding cancellations. ○ Paid net additions were 5.9M in Q2, and today we’re rolling out paid sharing to almost all of the remaining countries.  Q2‘23 revenue of $8.2B and operating profit of $1.8B were generally in-line with our forecast—and we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of ‘23 as we start to see the full benefits of paid sharing plus continued steady growth in our ad-supported plan. We’re still targeting a full year 2023 operating margin of 18% to 20%.  We’re a leader in terms of streaming engagement and, per Nielsen, we had the top original streaming series in the US for 24 of the first 25 weeks of 2023, and the top movie for 21 weeks. While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth. We remain focused on: creating a steady drumbeat of must watch shows and movies; improving monetization; growing the enjoyment of our games; and investing to improve our service for members. (in millions except per share data) Q2'22 Q3'22 Q4'22 Q1'23 Q2'23 Q3'23 Forecast Revenue $7,970 $7,926 $7,852 $8,162 $8,187 $8,520 Y/Y % Growth 8.6% 5.9% 1.9% 3.7% 2.7% 7.5% Operating Income $1,578 $1,533 $550 $1,714 $1,827 $1,890 Operating Margin 19.8% 19.3% 7.0% 21.0% 22.3% 22.2% Net Income $1,441 $1,398 $55 $1,305 $1,488 $1,580 Diluted EPS $3.20 $3.10 $0.12 $2.88 $3.29 $3.52 Global Streaming Paid Memberships 220.67 223.09 230.75 232.50 238.39 Y/Y % Growth 5.5% 4.5% 4.0% 4.9% 8.0% Global Streaming Paid Net Additions -0.97 2.41 7.66 1.75 5.89 Net cash provided by operating activities $103 $557 $444 $2,179 $1,440 Free Cash Flow $13 $472 $332 $2,117 $1,339 Shares (FD) 450.2 450.3 451.6 452.4 451.6 1 1 Q2 Results Revenue in Q2 grew 3% year over year (+6% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis ). Revenue growth 1 was driven by a 6% increase in average paid membership, while ARM declined 3% year over year (-1% 2 F/X neutral). The year-over-year ARM decline was driven by a combination of limited price increases over the past 12 months (leading up to the launch of paid sharing), timing of paid net additions (primarily late in the quarter due to the May 23 rollout of paid sharing in Q2), and a higher mix of membership growth from lower ARM countries. We had paid net additions of 5.9M for Q2’23 (with over 1M paid net adds in each region) vs. -1.0M in Q2’22 as we successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries (representing over 80% of our revenue). Q2 operating income totaled $1.8B, up 16% vs. $1.6B in the year ago quarter. Operating margin was 22%, compared with 20% in Q2’22. Both were slightly ahead of our beginning-of-quarter forecast due to ongoing expense management, slower-than-projected headcount growth and timing of content spend. EPS in Q2 amounted to $3.29 vs. $3.20 in Q2’22 and included a $29 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in “interest and other income/expense.” Forecast Our primary financial metrics are revenue for growth, and operating margin for profitability. Our goal is to accelerate revenue growth, expand our operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report. Now that we’ve launched paid sharing broadly, we have increased confidence in our financial outlook. We expect revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of 2023 as monetization grows from our most recent paid sharing launch and we expand our initiative across nearly all remaining countries plus the continued steady growth in our ad-supported plan (more details in the Monetization and Revenue section). For Q3, we forecast revenue of $8.5B, up 7% year over year on both a reported and F/X neutral basis, a slight acceleration from our Q2’23 F/X neutral revenue growth rate of 6%. Our revenue growth in Q3 will come from growth in average paid memberships. We expect F/X neutral ARM to be flat to slightly down year over year, as we are lapping price increases in 2022 and we generally haven’t had price increases in our largest revenue markets since the first half of last year (limited during paid sharing rollout). Revenue from advertising and our extra member feature are not yet material enough to offset these factors. We 3 anticipate Q3’23 paid net adds will be similar to Q2’23 paid net additions. We expect that our revenue 3 As a reminder, extra member accounts are not included in our paid membership count but add revenue that is included in ARM. 2 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period. These figures do not include sales taxes or VAT. 1 Excluding the year over year effect of foreign exchange rate movements. Assumes foreign exchange rates remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. 2 growth will accelerate more substantially in Q4’23 as we further monetize account sharing between households and steadily grow our advertising revenue. We expect Q3 operating income of $1.9B vs. $1.5B in Q3’22 and operating margin of 22% compared with 19% in the year ago period. We’re still targeting a full year 2023 operating margin of 18%-20%, based on F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, up from 17.8% in FY22. Engagement We focus on engagement because it's the best proxy we have for satisfaction. It’s also closely linked to retention, an important driver of our business. Key for Netflix members is the variety and quality of our content, with the understanding that quality is in the eye of the beholder. We’re often asked “what is a Netflix show?” The answer is one that super serves the audience, leaving them highly satisfied and excited for more. It’s the satirical dramedy Beef (starring Ali Wong and Steven Yeun) and the dating show Love is Blind S4 (both of which were in the Netflix Top 10 throughout April), the romance of Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story and the action of The Night Agent (both of which were in our top 10 throughout May)—stories that could not be more different and yet thrilled millions. The combination of content variety and personalization means that each person easily finds titles they will love. We learned the importance of variety back in the DVD days, and it’s become even more important with streaming. Because if you aspire to serve hundreds of millions of people all around the world, you can’t program for one set of tastes or sensibilities. You need to invest across genres, cultures and languages. Q2 was a good example of the range to which we aspire. Members could choose dramas like The Diplomat and Sanctuary (Japan), adrenaline-filled action with Arnold Schwarzenegger in FUBAR (followed by Arnold, a documentary about his life) and Fake Profile (Colombia), satire with Black Mirror, sports with the Tour de France: Unchained, romantic young adult comedy with XO Kitty (a TV spinoff from the To All Boys I’ve Loved Before film trilogy) or rap competition with Rhythm & Flow France S2. All these titles not only hit Netflix’s Top 10 list in their own country but also across multiple countries and our Global Top 10—showing that, with good subtitles and dubbing, plus easy discovery, great stories can truly come from anywhere and excite audiences everywhere. Even in the US, which has historically had incredibly local viewing habits, we’ve seen non-English language titles gain increasing popularity. Shows like Physical 100 (Korea), The Glory (Korea), Alice in Borderland (Japan), Marked Heart (Colombia), The Snow Girl (Spain) and Que Viva Mexico! (Mexico) and films such as Hunger (Thailand) and AKA (France) have all hit Nielsen’s weekly original streaming TV or film top 10 lists in the US for at least one week this year. As always, we strive for constant improvement and to increase the impact of our slate investments over time. Film is a good example of our steady progress, as our Q2 film slate demonstrated a consistent string of hits. We kicked off the quarter with Murder Mystery 2, featuring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston (114.3M views in its first three months). This was followed by the thriller The Mother* (starring 4 4 Views are based on the first 91 days of release. For titles released less than 91 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 16, 2023. We publish weekly our top titles based on engagement at Netflix Top 10. 3 Jennifer Lopez) in May, which spent six weeks atop our Top 10 weekly films list and has now become one of our most popular films of all time with 131.6 million views. We closed the quarter with the Chris Hemsworth-led action blockbuster Extraction 2*, which garnered 116.7M views in only 31 days. Murder Mystery 2 and Extraction 2 also sparked renewed interest in the original films, with both surging back into the Global Top 10 in Q2, several years after they first premiered on Netflix, highlighting the durability of these titles and talent. We see similar fandom on the TV side too. Bridgerton S1 reappeared in Netflix’s Top 10 in May when Queen Charlotte*—our latest story in the Bridgerton franchise—launched (79.6M views), Never Have I Ever S1 re-emerged in June when we premiered the fourth and final season of this beloved coming of age story and The Witcher S1 and S2 returned to our Top 10 in July as fans re-immerse themselves in the third season of this fantasy drama. This success demonstrates the progress we’ve made building lasting intellectual property (IP) from a standing start just a decade ago. This year we’ll have more returning seasons than any other streamer with The Crown, Top Boy, The Upshaws, Sweet Magnolias, Heartstopper, Virgin River, Too Hot To Handle and more still to come. In June, we evolved our Netflix Top 10, which provides weekly engagement data for our top shows and movies, across 93 countries. We continue to provide total hours viewed, but now rank titles by the number of views (i.e. total hours viewed divided by the runtime ). We think this new approach is more 5 intuitive and it also adjusts for runtime (i.e. longer films or series don’t get an inherent advantage). We’ve also extended our Most Popular lists of all time from 28 days to 91 days so people can see how great stories grow over time. We believe sharing this engagement data on a regular basis helps talent and the broader industry understand what success looks like on Netflix—and we hope that other streamers become more transparent about engagement on their services over time. Below is a consolidated list of our global Top 10 all-time most popular TV shows and movies based on views.6 We build on the success of our titles with marketing to fuel conversation, fandom and discovery (the thrill of the find). In June, we hosted our third annual fan event Tudum in person for the first time. Over 10,000 fans attended live in Brazil and the show generated 78M views across our social platforms, an 6 As of July 16 2023. 5 We’ll publish all three data sets - views, total hours viewed and runtime - each week. 4 86% year-over-year increase and up over 200% from 2021’s 25.7M. It’s inspiring to witness the passion that exists for our shows and films, something we believe truly sets Netflix apart. Monetization and Revenue In addition to delivering an ever-improving slate and product experience, we’ve been working to improve our monetization through initiatives like paid sharing and advertising. This will allow us to generate more revenue off a bigger base, which we can reinvest to make Netflix even better for our members. Advertising enables us to offer consumers a lower price point and, eight months post launch, we’re working hard to scale the business. Our key focus is improving the ads experience for both members and advertisers. In addition to now offering 95% content parity globally (by viewing), more streams plus improved video quality on our ads plan, we’re partnering with Nielsen and EDO to improve measurement and innovating for advertisers. Brands can also now target media buys on our Top 10, which is updated daily and enables them to connect with audiences during our biggest viewing moments. While we continue to grow our reach—ads plan membership has nearly doubled since Q1— it’s still off a small membership base, so current ad revenue isn’t material for Netflix. Building an ads business from scratch isn’t easy and we have lots of hard work ahead, but we’re confident that over time we can develop advertising into a multi-billion dollar incremental revenue stream. Increased sophistication on pricing and plans strategy is important to improved monetization. In Q1, we lowered prices in a number of less penetrated markets, and in Q2, we phased out our Basic ads-free plan for new and rejoining members in Canada (existing members on the Basic ads-free plan are unaffected). We’re now doing the same in the US and the UK. We believe our entry prices in these countries – $6.99 in the US, £4.99 in the UK and $5.99 in Canada – provide great value to consumers given the breadth and quality of our catalog. Tackling account sharing between households has been another focus as it undermines our ability to invest to improve Netflix for our paying members and grow our business. In May, we expanded paid sharing to 100+ countries, which account for over 80% of our revenue. The cancel reaction was low and while we’re still in the early stages of monetization, we’re seeing healthy conversion of borrower households into full paying Netflix memberships as well as the uptake of our extra member feature. We are revenue and paid membership positive vs. prior to the launch of paid sharing across every region in our latest launch. Beginning today, we’ll start to address account sharing between households in almost all of our remaining countries. In these markets, we’re not offering an extra member option given that we’ve recently cut prices in a good number of these countries (for example, Indonesia, Croatia, Kenya, and India) and penetration is still relatively low in many of them so we have plenty of runway without creating additional complexity. Households borrowing Netflix will be able to transfer existing profiles to new and existing accounts. 5 Competition Consumers have so many amazing entertainment choices — from movies and TV shows to sports and news to gaming and social media just to name a few. We expect that competition will remain intense, including within streaming. Our biggest traditional entertainment competitors, Disney, Comcast/NBCU, Paramount Global and Warner Brothers Discovery — with their large content libraries and creative expertise — are now focused on profit so they can build sustainable, long term streaming businesses. And our big tech competitors Apple, Amazon and YouTube — with their broad reach and deep pockets — continue to invest heavily to grow their streaming revenues. Netflix’s revenue was $32B in 2022, compared to nearly $40B for YouTube across all its products (trailing 12-month basis as of Q1’23) and 7 Amazon’s $35B subscription revenue in 2022, of which we assume the majority relates to the Prime bundle that includes shipping, video and other services. Combined with Apple’s video initiatives, there’s 8 quite a competitive battle happening. Nielsen’s The Gauge: Share of US TV Screen Time, Total Day, Persons 2+ But while streaming is intensely competitive, we’ve shown that with strong execution and focus, it can be a great business. Long term success takes strength in both entertainment and technology, a combination that’s not been required of large media or tech companies in the past. It’s about one’s ability to work with the best creators; to produce and license movies, TV shows and ultimately games across multiple genres and languages globally; to create a stellar discovery engine; to build great partnerships and payments systems; and to continually pierce the zeitgeist with consumer passion and fandom. Improving across all these areas is key to ensuring that Netflix continues to lead the streaming 8 We don’t know how much of Amazon’s subscription revenue is related to Prime, Prime Video, or other digital and non-AWS subscriptions. 7 Including YouTube Ads, Premium, Music, and TV. 6 pack in terms of engagement, revenue and profit over the long term. We have much more to do and we’re ready for the challenge. Cash Flow and Capital Structure Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was $1.4B vs. $0.1B in the prior year period. Free cash flow in Q2’23 amounted to $1.3B compared with about breakeven in the year ago quarter. Assuming no 9 material swings in F/X, we now anticipate at least $5B in FCF for 2023, up from our prior estimate of at least $3.5B. Our updated expectation reflects lower cash content spend in 2023 than we originally anticipated due to timing of production starts and the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While this may create some lumpiness in FCF from 2023 to 2024, we plan to deliver substantial positive FCF in 2024 (with a cash content spend to content amortization ratio of roughly 1.1x). We finished Q2 with gross debt of $14.5B (in-line with our $10B-$15B targeted range) and cash and short term investments of $8.6B. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8M shares for $645M. We now have $3.4B of capacity remaining under our $5B share buyback authorization. We’re currently running a bit above our targeted minimum cash level , so we expect to increase our stock repurchase activity in the 10 second half of 2023, assuming no material change in our business. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) We aspire to entertain the world—and to do so sustainably and responsibly. In April, we published our 2022 Inclusion Report Update—sharing the progress we’ve made to increase representation within our company. The latest USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative study into diversity on and off camera in our US film and series from 2020 to 2021 shows improvements for women and people from underrepresented groups. We also continue to support the next generation of talent through our Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which has invested $29 million in more than 100 programs across 35 countries in the last two years. These updates on inclusion, along with updates on additional ESG initiatives, can be found in our fourth annual ESG report, which was published in June. We continue to make progress on meeting our climate targets through optimizing our energy use, then electrifying it and decarbonizing the rest to bring remaining emissions to zero. The report also shares how we have evolved our governance structure. Reference For quick reference, our past investor letters can be found here. 10 We target maintaining minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue (i.e., about $5.5B based on Q2 revenue of $8.2B). 9 Defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. 7\"}"

       "{'Document_intro': 'Fellow shareholders, We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than doubled global operating income. . 1 ',\n",
       " 'Q4 Results': 'Average paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in ASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5% margin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating margin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year. EPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items that affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which partially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform. In Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last year’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet entertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based. In the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3 million. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although contribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the marketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter. Internationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record for quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue and ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments in a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017 (4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution profit in our history. We took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected expense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger than expected member growth and the timing of international content spend.',\n",
       " 'Forecast': ' The guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net adds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally. As we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year 2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year. We believe our big investments in content are paying off. In 2017, average streaming hours per membership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more revenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018. 2 Big hits like 13 Reasons Why, Stranger Things and Bright result from a combination of great content and great marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about $1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content, and we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll grow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018.',\n",
       " 'Content': ' Q4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of The Crown and Black Mirror as well as Stranger Things, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon. In the quarter, we also successfully launched new titles like the limited series Godless, Marvel’s The Punisher and Mindhunter (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s amazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had three of the Top 5 most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row. Our largest investment in original films to date, Bright, a fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a major success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, Bright has become one of our most viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well as additional investment in original films. We’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of Club de Cuervos as well as The Day I Met El Chapo, both of which are from Mexico; Suburra from Italy; and an unscripted series from the UK, Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father. We also debuted Dark, our first German original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for instance, Dark, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions of members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with attractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this initiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland, India, Korea and Japan. We are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall deals with Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy and Orange is the New Black and GLOW creator Jenji Kohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over the world.',\n",
       " 'Product and Partnerships': ' We are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our mutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix, while our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of these types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche Telekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC removed the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net 3 neutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the FCC’s action.',\n",
       " 'Competition': ' We have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend becomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On the commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with Apple Music or with iOS. Facebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their multi-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for entertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix. Traditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring most of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand and great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.',\n",
       " 'Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure': ' In Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower end of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of content payments, which will now occur in 2018. Our operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is content. When we develop a title like Bright, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated membership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for self-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend will turn our business FCF positive. In the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re growing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had planned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018. Given our track record of content investments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the increased investments we are making in original content this year. We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of interest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to grow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt. High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick. 4 ',\n",

Rodolphe is the former CEO of Canal+ Group in France, and is currently CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business. A large and growing percentage of our members are European, and we are fortunate to have a leader like Rodolphe join our board.',\n",

Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our investments in marketing, technology and 5 development, and content, including original content; content and product partnerships; impact of U.S. net neutrality rules; growth of internet video and competitive landscape; future capital raises; expectations of positive free cash flow, impact of the new limitation on the deductibility of interest; domestic and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic and international operations, as well as consolidated operating income, operating margin; net income, earnings per share and free cash flow.

Revenue growth 1 was driven by a 6% increase in average paid membership, while ARM declined 3% year over year (-1% 2 F/X neutral). The year-over-year ARM decline was driven by a combination of limited price increases over the past 12 months (leading up to the launch of paid sharing), timing of paid net additions (primarily late in the quarter due to the May 23 rollout of paid sharing in Q2), and a higher mix of membership growth from lower ARM countries. We had paid net additions of 5.9M for Q2’23 (with over 1M paid net adds in each region) vs. -1.0M in Q2’22 as we successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries (representing over 80% of our revenue). Q2 operating income totaled $1.8B, up 16% vs. $1.6B in the year ago quarter. Operating margin was 22%, compared with 20% in Q2’22. Both were slightly ahead of our beginning-of-quarter forecast due to ongoing expense management, slower-than-projected headcount growth and timing of content spend. EPS in Q2 amounted to $3.29 vs. $3.20 in Q2’22 and included a $29 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt, which is recognized below operating income in “interest and other income/expense.” ',\n",

       " 'Engagement': \" We focus on engagement because it's the best proxy we have for satisfaction. It’s also closely linked to retention, an important driver of our business. Key for Netflix members is the variety and quality of our content, with the understanding that quality is in the eye of the beholder. We’re often asked “what is a Netflix show?” The answer is one that super serves the audience, leaving them highly satisfied and excited for more. It’s the satirical dramedy Beef (starring Ali Wong and Steven Yeun) and the dating show Love is Blind S4 (both of which were in the Netflix Top 10 throughout April), the romance of Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story and the action of The Night Agent (both of which were in our top 10 throughout May)—stories that could not be more different and yet thrilled millions. The combination of content variety and personalization means that each person easily finds titles they will love. We learned the importance of variety back in the DVD days, and it’s become even more important with streaming. Because if you aspire to serve hundreds of millions of people all around the world, you can’t program for one set of tastes or sensibilities. You need to invest across genres, cultures and languages. Q2 was a good example of the range to which we aspire. Members could choose dramas like The Diplomat and Sanctuary (Japan), adrenaline-filled action with Arnold Schwarzenegger in FUBAR (followed by Arnold, a documentary about his life) and Fake Profile (Colombia), satire with Black Mirror, sports with the Tour de France: Unchained, romantic young adult comedy with XO Kitty (a TV spinoff from the To All Boys I’ve Loved Before film trilogy) or rap competition with Rhythm & Flow France S2. All these titles not only hit Netflix’s Top 10 list in their own country but also across multiple countries and our Global Top 10—showing that, with good subtitles and dubbing, plus easy discovery, great stories can truly come from anywhere and excite audiences everywhere. Even in the US, which has historically had incredibly local viewing habits, we’ve seen non-English language titles gain increasing popularity. Shows like Physical 100 (Korea), The Glory (Korea), Alice in Borderland (Japan), Marked Heart (Colombia), The Snow Girl (Spain) and Que Viva Mexico! (Mexico) and films such as Hunger (Thailand) and AKA (France) have all hit Nielsen’s weekly original streaming TV or film top 10 lists in the US for at least one week this year. As always, we strive for constant improvement and to increase the impact of our slate investments over time. Film is a good example of our steady progress, as our Q2 film slate demonstrated a consistent string of hits. We kicked off the quarter with Murder Mystery 2, featuring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston (114.3M views in its first three months). This was followed by the thriller The Mother* (starring 4 4 Views are based on the first 91 days of release. For titles released less than 91 days (denoted with an asterisk), data is from launch date through July 16, 2023. We publish weekly our top titles based on engagement at Netflix Top 10. 3 Jennifer Lopez) in May, which spent six weeks atop our Top 10 weekly films list and has now become one of our most popular films of all time with 131.6 million views. We closed the quarter with the Chris Hemsworth-led action blockbuster Extraction 2*, which garnered 116.7M views in only 31 days. Murder Mystery 2 and Extraction 2 also sparked renewed interest in the original films, with both surging back into the Global Top 10 in Q2, several years after they first premiered on Netflix, highlighting the durability of these titles and talent. We see similar fandom on the TV side too. Bridgerton S1 reappeared in Netflix’s Top 10 in May when Queen Charlotte*—our latest story in the Bridgerton franchise—launched (79.6M views), Never Have I Ever S1 re-emerged in June when we premiered the fourth and final season of this beloved coming of age story and The Witcher S1 and S2 returned to our Top 10 in July as fans re-immerse themselves in the third season of this fantasy drama. This success demonstrates the progress we’ve made building lasting intellectual property (IP) from a standing start just a decade ago. This year we’ll have more returning seasons than any other streamer with The Crown, Top Boy, The Upshaws, Sweet Magnolias, Heartstopper, Virgin River, Too Hot To Handle and more still to come. In June, we evolved our Netflix Top 10, which provides weekly engagement data for our top shows and movies, across 93 countries. We continue to provide total hours viewed, but now rank titles by the number of views (i.e. total hours viewed divided by the runtime ). We think this new approach is more 5 intuitive and it also adjusts for runtime (i.e. longer films or series don’t get an inherent advantage). We’ve also extended our Most Popular lists of all time from 28 days to 91 days so people can see how great stories grow over time. We believe sharing this engagement data on a regular basis helps talent and the broader industry understand what success looks like on Netflix—and we hope that other streamers become more transparent about engagement on their services over time. Below is a consolidated list of our global Top 10 all-time most popular TV shows and movies based on views.6 We build on the success of our titles with marketing to fuel conversation, fandom and discovery (the thrill of the find). In June, we hosted our third annual fan event Tudum in person for the first time. Over 10,000 fans attended live in Brazil and the show generated 78M views across our social platforms, an 6 As of July 16 2023. 5 We’ll publish all three data sets - views, total hours viewed and runtime - each week. 4 86% year-over-year increase and up over 200% from 2021’s 25.7M.

       " 'Monetization and Revenue': \" section). For Q3, we forecast revenue of $8.5B, up 7% year over year on both a reported and F/X neutral basis, a slight acceleration from our Q2’23 F/X neutral revenue growth rate of 6%. Our revenue growth in Q3 will come from growth in average paid memberships. We expect F/X neutral ARM to be flat to slightly down year over year, as we are lapping price increases in 2022 and we generally haven’t had price increases in our largest revenue markets since the first half of last year (limited during paid sharing rollout). Revenue from advertising and our extra member feature are not yet material enough to offset these factors. We 3 anticipate Q3’23 paid net adds will be similar to Q2’23 paid net additions. We expect that our revenue 3 As a reminder, extra member accounts are not included in our paid membership count but add revenue that is included in ARM. 2 ARM (Average Revenue per Membership) is defined as streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period.

We expect Q3 operating income of $1.9B vs. $1.5B in Q3’22 and operating margin of 22% compared with 19% in the year ago period. We’re still targeting a full year 2023 operating margin of 18%-20%, based on F/X rates as of January 1, 2023, up from 17.8% in FY22.

       " 'Competition': ' Consumers have so many amazing entertainment choices — from movies and TV shows to sports and news to gaming and social media just to name a few. We expect that competition will remain intense, including within streaming. Our biggest traditional entertainment competitors, Disney, Comcast/NBCU, Paramount Global and Warner Brothers Discovery — with their large content libraries and creative expertise — are now focused on profit so they can build sustainable, long term streaming businesses. And our big tech competitors Apple, Amazon and YouTube — with their broad reach and deep pockets — continue to invest heavily to grow their streaming revenues. Netflix’s revenue was $32B in 2022, compared to nearly $40B for YouTube across all its products (trailing 12-month basis as of Q1’23) and 7 Amazon’s $35B subscription revenue in 2022, of which we assume the majority relates to the Prime bundle that includes shipping, video and other services. Combined with Apple’s video initiatives, there’s 8 quite a competitive battle happening. Nielsen’s The Gauge: Share of US TV Screen Time, Total Day, Persons 2+ But while streaming is intensely competitive, we’ve shown that with strong execution and focus, it can be a great business. Long term success takes strength in both entertainment and technology, a combination that’s not been required of large media or tech companies in the past. It’s about one’s ability to work with the best creators; to produce and license movies, TV shows and ultimately games across multiple genres and languages globally; to create a stellar discovery engine; to build great partnerships and payments systems; and to continually pierce the zeitgeist with consumer passion and fandom. Improving across all these areas is key to ensuring that Netflix continues to lead the streaming 8 We don’t know how much of Amazon’s subscription revenue is related to Prime, Prime Video, or other digital and non-AWS subscriptions. 7 Including YouTube Ads, Premium, Music, and TV. 6 pack in terms of engagement, revenue and profit over the long term.

       " 'Cash Flow and Capital Structure': ' Net cash generated by operating activities in Q2 was $1.4B vs. $0.1B in the prior year period. Free cash flow in Q2’23 amounted to $1.3B compared with about breakeven in the year ago quarter. Assuming no 9 material swings in F/X, we now anticipate at least $5B in FCF for 2023, up from our prior estimate of at least $3.5B. Our updated expectation reflects lower cash content spend in 2023 than we originally anticipated due to timing of production starts and the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While this may create some lumpiness in FCF from 2023 to 2024, we plan to deliver substantial positive FCF in 2024 (with a cash content spend to content amortization ratio of roughly 1.1x). We finished Q2 with gross debt of $14.5B (in-line with our $10B-$15B targeted range) and cash and short term investments of $8.6B. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8M shares for $645M. We now have $3.4B of capacity remaining under our $5B share buyback authorization. We’re currently running a bit above our targeted minimum cash level , so we expect to increase our stock repurchase activity in the 10 second half of 2023, assuming no material change in our business.

The latest USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative study into diversity on and off camera in our US film and series from 2020 to 2021 shows improvements for women and people from underrepresented groups. We also continue to support the next generation of talent through our Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which has invested $29 million in more than 100 programs across 35 countries in the last two years. These updates on inclusion, along with updates on additional ESG initiatives, can be found in our fourth annual ESG report, which was published in June.

We \\nanticipate returning to global profitability in Q2, and plan to launch our next international market in Q4.   \\nWe are constantly improving our service with better personalization, better user-interfaces, better \\nstreaming, and more content.  As a result, per-member viewing hours set new records in Q1 and are on \\ntrack to do so again in Q2, on a year-over-year basis.  We launched our service in the UK and Ireland in \\nJanuary and are very pleased that, after the first 90 days, we had substantially more members than we \\nhad after the first 90 days of Canada or Latin America.       \\n \\n (in millions except per share data)\\nQ2 '10\\nQ3 '10\\nQ4 '10\\nQ1 '11\\nQ2 '11\\nQ3 '11\\nQ4 '11\\nQ1 '12 \\nG id\\n \\nDomestic Streaming:\\nNet Subscription Additions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n0.22\\n1.74\\nTotal Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n21.45\\n21.67\\n23.41\\nPaid Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n20.51\\n20.15\\n22.02\\nRevenue\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -   $       476  $       507 \\nContribution Profit\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -   $         52  $         67 \\nContribution Margin\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n10.9%\\n13.2%\\nInternational Streaming:\\nNet Subscription Additions\\n -  \\n0.13\\n0.38\\n0.29\\n0.16\\n0.51\\n0.38\\n1.21\\nTotal Subscriptions\\n -  \\n0.13\\n0.51\\n0.80\\n0.97\\n1.48\\n1.86\\n3.07\\nPaid Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n0.33\\n0.67\\n0.86\\n0.99\\n1.45\\n2.41\\nRevenue\\n -   $          -    $           4  $         12  $         19  $         23  $         29  $         43 \\nContribution Profit (Loss)\\n -   $          (3)  $          (9)  $        (11)  $          (9)  $        (23)  $        (60)  $      (103)\\nDomestic DVD:\\nNet Subscription Additions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n(2.76)\\n(1.08)\\nTotal Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n13.93\\n11.17\\n10.09\\nPaid Subscriptions\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n13.81\\n11.04\\n9.96\\nRevenue\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -   $       370  $       320 \\nContribution Profit\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -   $       194  $       146 \\nContribution Margin\\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n -  \\n52.4%\\n45.6%\\nTotal Domestic (Streaming + DVD, for historical comparison):\\nRevenue\\n $       520  $       553  $       592  $       706  $       770  $       799  $       847  $       826 \\nY/Y Change\\n27%\\n31%\\n33%\\n43%\\n48%\\n44%\\n43%\\n17%\\nContribution Profit\\n $       130  $       130  $       152  $       187  $       213  $       219  $       246  $       213 \\nY/Y Change\\n40%\\n46%\\n55%\\n68%\\n64%\\n68%\\n62%\\n14%\\nGlobal:\\nRevenue\\n $       520  $       553  $       596  $       719  $       789  $       822  $       876  $       870 \\nY/Y Change\\n27%\\n31%\\n34%\\n46%\\n52%\\n49%\\n47%\\n21%\\nNet Income (Loss)\\n $         44  $         38  $         47  $         60  $         68  $         62  $         35  $          (5)\\nY/Y Change\\n38%\\n27%\\n52%\\n88%\\n55%\\n63%\\n-26%\\nNM\\nEPS\\n $      0.80  $      0.70  $      0.87  $      1.11  $      1.26  $      1.16  $      0.64  $     (0.08)\\nY/Y Change\\n48%\\n35%\\n55%\\n88%\\n58%\\n66%\\n-26%\\nNM\\nFree Cash Flow\\n $         34  $           8  $         51  $         79  $         60  $         14  $         34  $           2 \\nBuyback\\n $         45  $         57 \\n $          -    $       109  $         51  $         40 \\n $          -    $          -   \\nShares (FD)\\n54.3\\n53.9\\n54.2\\n54.2\\n53.9\\n53.9\\n55.4\\n55.5\\n\""
